good food nice shops,"here is a place where you can buy make ups and tons of korean beauty products. they also have some restaus, pharmacies, groceries and street food. live the street food especially the fried banana and glazed strawberries"
Shopping,"Looking to stock up on beauty products, creams and everything you will ever need, this is the street to go.. They do deals for tourists like buy 10 get 10 free plus if you take your passport with you they will give you the vat back on it. You dont need to take your passport but it saves the lines once you get to the airport to claim your vat back"
More of an evening location,"Initially walked around at mid-day and it was deadsville. Lots of shops and restaurants that could be found in multiple other locations. Happened to come back in the early evening and was shocked by the amount of people walking around, the lights and the energy. Don’t regret going but still didn’t feel it was particularly special."
Everything you need is here,"very neat and organised shopping street, good stuffs ranging from cheap until branded.the attractive ones are line shop and art box. the place is also very instagrammableproblem is quite hard to find that can show the direction in English, since the google maps doesn't help a lot in finding certain spots by walking. Still very interesting place to visit even more than 1 time during one visit. will try again to visit during night time with different ambiences of course. Since it would take a lot of walking, good shoes and nice weather/ season choosing would be important."
Delicious food vendors,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight."
Lots of food and shopping,Full of tourists and nice ambience for shopping. Good prices and a lot of varieties but a lot of fake goods so beware
Trending market ,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market. This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items.If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won.Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes. From famous fashion brands to ordinary types. The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia.If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food."
Shopping ,We had no idea how much shopping plays in the lives of the Koreans. This area is like times Square in New York. 
"Very clean, friendly and polite people, interesting and a visual shopping feast","Very interesting varied shopping area. Friendly, helpful and polite venders. Good bargains to be had.At night markets, street food very cheap and delicious. Fascinating to watch the stall holders prep and cook their food- very clean. Area well lit, easy walk, friendly atmosphere, Well worth a visit"
Great place to shop and eat,"Fun, bustling area with plenty of places to shop , people watch and eat. Great Korean restaurants and street food options are plenty and delicious."
Hustling and bursting with food,"We stay at nine tree Myeong-dong2 hotel ,about a block away from the shopping area Nice walk up the litter hill and you are there , after 4pm all the street food stall starting to come out and in no time at all every corner is fill with food stall , prepare to go there with an empty stomach, everything you can imagine it’s there , wow what a place to be I feel like a kid , wanting to try everything, because of so many different type of food we went there 3 night in a roll just to try as much as we can"
Good for an evening vibe,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time."
Just like any other shopping destination in Asia,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it’s just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food’s quite nice if you’re starving while shopping. That’s all there is to it.
Busy shopping street with lots of food stalls,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists. "
"If you like shopping, this is your place","Seoul is plenty of shopping centers, markets,.... but Myeongdong is the top:a jungle of shops, restaurants, bars, hotels,... that will meet your expectations. If shopping is a boring activity, acoording to me, avoid this place."
Shopping central,"This is definitely a great place to stop by. Even if you don't care for shopping too much, they have a lot of great street food options and it's just really cool to see and experience. If you do love shopping, then this will be glorious. Maybe even to the point that it can get overwhelming. Not only do they have hundreds of shops in a bunch alleys, there are multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) of the same shop. So, if you're looking for Etude House, you'll probably find 4+ of those. It can get confusing considering how many alleyways there are. Also, the stands will have some shopping too.Overall, a great place but if you're wanting to shop I'd suggest dedicating at least a few hours. It's a lot to go through."
Amezing Myeongdong,The most colorful area of Seoul. The paradise of cosmetics and fine coffee. People from all over the world are doing their shopping and at the same time tasting amazing local delicacies from street vendors. Don't be afraid to try them! The market starts from the Catholic Cathedral and reaches the Lotte department store.
"Feast for the eyes, Ladies' Haven","So much to see, so much to explore. The koreans are really good at their pitch sales. The attractive deals and the friendly sales people draw me back night after night to hunt down its bargain. Go in the night, weather is cooler in the evenings in June and the street foods are irresistible. "
Superb Shopping Location,"If you have clothes or shoes to buy, look no further. You will go crazy at the number of ABC-Mart or fashion boutiques here. Shoes are really much cheaper in Korea! I wonder why that is so though. There are also many roadside stalls selling Korean street food, although there tend to be many shops of the same variety. I think the best experience is to grab any street food you like and munch on them while shopping. By the time you are done, you would be filled with food but empty in the wallet."
Shopping street,Shopping street good also for street food: a lot of choices and a lot of restaurant around.You should find also what you are looking for.Nice place where to walk for your shopping.
Myeongdong is a must!,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our “fantastically memorable “ Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you’ll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It’s so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectator the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!"
It's Unique Korean Handmade Store,It is very cozy and lovely the various handmade store.I'd like to highly recommend this store when you visit MyeongDong Street.MyeongDong 6gil 2-1
Must do,It's hard to believe how busy this street is when the rest of Seoul is quiet. This street is a must-visit place. There are so many street foods to try and many restaurants are open late into the night. The best part of this street is the food. Don't miss it.
Crowded area,"Personally, i don’t really like this area but it has some shops i really like, like TopTen10 and Uniqlo. The street food is great though. I was surprised of all the cheap copies of e.g. Supreme that was on sale everywhere"
Very good ,"This a very busy area full of shops and small things to do like late night massage, food and drinks. "
Busy Street,We really enjoyed our visit here even though there are a lot of shoppers going around for this is a famous place that you need to visit when in Korea. Since my daughter loves korean beauty n makeup products she really went crazy buying stuffs for it is much cheaper here. Their street food is good if you're not picky.
A Tourist Spot,"If you never see what's night market, then this is the place. You can try all kinds of Korean street food. You can shopping at all kinds of shops. But, be careful if you have young children as they will get lost as it is very crowded during weekends. "
Everyday a place to go since it's close late and near to my hotel,"It's just not tired for coming here everyday!!! I love all the sports shop there just too many! I grab most item that is on sale. From face mask of all korean brand to try, make up, sports shoes, bags, ladies clothes, socks, korean snacks, whatever you need it's just here to get.Must try the street food, take a look at the cart stores selling clothes, jackets, korean small restaurant to dine, Cafes, too many aisle to walk just don't get lost or find the Nature Republic Green leaves at the tall wall if going back to the train subway :)"
Night Time Shopping,"Plenty of shops in this area of Seoul and they appear to stay open all night as well. Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway."
Must see for shoppers....,"Non-shoppers may want to stop by just to see the scene or grab some delicious street food. Myeong-Dong is super busy from about mid-morning until late at night. Really, there is something for everyone however, mostly geared toward those interested in shopping. Skin care products are all the rage and are all over the place here - from high end to bargain buys, there are clothes in all sizes, and more food options than you could imagine. Street foods (anything on a stick), the sweet and savory egg bread, my personal favorite Delimanjoo (pricy at exit 4 of the metro, they put on a bit of a show too), and higher end restaurants where you can sit for a nice meal. Go with patience and empty hands (i.e. - don't bring your luggage). Definitely not a 'local market' experience however, good for some gifts to send home and people watching."
Very vibrant at night,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11. I'd definitely cone back again. "
Everything in one place,Massive shopping area with side by side cosmetics and fashion stores making for easy price comparisons. And food stalls that come out at sunset make for a wonderful street food experience.
Shop Shop Shop💯,"Myeongdong shopping street was easy to access as it is near the subway station(exit 7). The shopping street has different things that you could buy such as souvenirs,branded shoes(fila,nike etc),bags and they even have street food that sells halal food which is easy for a muslim traveller like me. So you could grab street food whenever you are hungry while shopping definitely recommend travellers to visit Myeongdong to shop❤️ The price is affordable for certain things as some of souvenirs is pricey but as you walk around you’ll find cheaper ones!!"
Tons of Korean beauty products ,"This shopping street was near our hotel so we made sure we checked it out. The streets were so long and we didn’t see where they end. You can find street food stalls here, Korean marts and souvenirs but omg if you are into Korean Beauty products this is the place!!! I was in heaven and bought so many masks ✌️Definitely worth visiting!!!"
Interesting but I preferred Namdaemun,"This market was interesting,but I found Namdaemun fascinating.If I could only visit one of the two,it would be Namdaemun. "
Busy part of town. A little difficult if you have young children,"I loved this place. When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends."
Shopping paradise for women,You can never get enough of Myeongdong shopping street if you are a woman who likes yummy street food and make-up. All the Korean brands are there and the prices are cheaper than in my country.
Great shopping area,"Skincare, cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks, souvenirs, cute things and a whole lot more. "
Must see,"Well organized market that has everything from electronics, to groceries, to clothes, to cafes. Everyone was pleasant and no one was pushy. Highly recommend to visit and try some of the local cuisine "
Central skincare products!,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too... if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough."
Lots of good things to see,The shopping street is a series of closed off roads where vendors sell local foods in the evening. Cosmetic shops and local grocery stores proliferate. Not sure if too many bargains can be found but it is a fun night out. Of course the obligatory massage places are also everywhere.
Great shopping and street food 🍲 ,"Top area to go shopping.Really good street food as well !! All diff. brands there. Lots of shops for cloth, beauty products and other things. Reasonably priced. "
Birthday trip,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain. We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics."
Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise ,"♨️✈️ Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise A cosmetic haven. One can buy, buy and then buy some more and then perhaps come another day to buy few more... and folks that is Myeongdong Market for you.It’s a cosmetic aficionado’s or enthusiast’s paradise.There is a vast potpourri or omnium gatherum of popular Korean cosmetic brands. You could choose or collect all from HOLIKA HOLIKA to Innisfree and Etude House to Tony Moly and MISSHA. The list is never ending. When you feel like taking a break you could pick a fruit glass or choose from an array of grills from the vendors in the middle of the road. Once replenished, you could start all over again. So shop till you drop."
Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers especially the night ones! Unique experience and not that known... its a great surprise while getting informed about the sight seeing of this wonderful city
Street food and many more,A nice place to spend the evening with the street foods and shops opened until late night. For middle easterners the a halal restaurant Saffron Restaurant is just around the corner.
Amazing,Amazing and almost overwhelming!So many vendors to choose from-all assortments ofgoods and food stalls. Packed at peak times but that is part of the experience!A must see in Seoul!
Bustling place,"In the evening the area becomes a bustling place, with music raging from each & every shop; food stalls, souvenirs, and clothes stalls line up the streets while the lights of commercials and adds placed on the buildings add the finishing touches on this lively & intense place "
"Crowd place, the street food over price","Its full of shops, and it will be no enough for 1-2 hours. Mostly cosmetic and sports shop. We tried to the food street, however we notice they sell the food veryyy pricey as they know many tourist come to the area. As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price. If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want. They usually stand in middle pf myeongdong. Love to see around myeongdong but will not buy food from there again. "
Little of everything along with night market and street food. ,Found this place the first night we got in as it was only 20 min walk from hotel. They have a several street food to sample. Lots to see for a quick tour of the neighborhood Had our first fried chicken and beer here 
Must see,"Skin care stores are all over and you will see their chains on the next block. So don't worry about finding one particular location. Some products irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin so test before you buy. We went on a Monday, after 4pm, you will see food stalls on the street. Must try the food!!! They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby, one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable. If you need another luggage you can also get it here for all the stuff you buy. Right next to subway line 2 and 3 too."
Perfect ,I love Myeongdong street. This is heaven shopping paradise for me. All the sales person are friendly and warm smile. We love the street food too. 
Crazy energy,"At night, all the stores shine in neon. Every Korean cosmetics company has at least one store here. Also has the honey butter almonds shop. Many street food innovations that I haven't seen before. Not quite cheap, though."
Great for an evening stroll,"Great place for an evening stroll. Plenty of interesting stall having a variety of street food and some very unique,loved the egg buns and grilled lobster"
Lots to browse - layout suspiciously similar to my other fav haunt!,"Myeongdong shopping street and the accompanying underground shopping belt is full of surprises. Look out for the largest Uniqlo, and the “factory outlet” of the famed flavoured nut snacks... nuzzling and busy.Maybe it’s me but the Underground shopping belt is strangely similar to platinum mall in Bkk...."
Myeongdong Shopping street,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look. "
Back again and again,"No matter how many times I go to Myeongdong shopping street, I never got tired of it. There are so many shops and people, just very happening place. Lots of nice stuff to buy, apparels, food. We went to the same cafe on 2 consecutive days and will go again if we visit the street in future.At around 4pm, the street vendors start setting up their stalls and the whole place just gets busier. Highly recommend this place to Seoul visitors."
Shopping shopping shopping,"If you want to shop this is the place. We only went for a browse, but you could find anything you needed here. "
"Busy, crowded but fun",We went one night during heavy heavy rains yet still found this open air market unbelievably active and crowded. Fun to look at all the interesting food being sold. Parking pretty impossible there.
touristy but worth a visit,"i’ve been to seoul several times but i still can’t resist returning to this place to shop every time, particularly for masks and cosmetics. yes, it’s touristy and crowded, and you will be solicited by shopkeepers on the street every now and then (i haven’t encountered anyone particularly aggressive or pushy so they’re easy to brush off), but i would still recommend going there to shop for beauty products as there is a wide variety and the prices are decent."
I love it and I hate. ,"Unless you visit at 10am between Mon-Thurs expect it to be a mad house. It’s always jam packed with people. As as westerner it has some of the best options for shopping in my opinion as it offers more stores and sizes that I’m familiar with. Also it has all the major local stores if interested in those. The street food is second to none in Korea! I would recommend everyone go at least twice, first time time to experience the crowds so when you return again you’re have an idea of what to expect and will be able to enjoy it a bit more. "
Great for shopping,A few connected streets suitable for walking and full of shops. Great for shopping clothes and beauty products. The street vendors selling food were all very delicious too.
Best to visit at night,"Lots of shops, market stalls and street food. Feels very safe (as does the whole of Seoul). Most shops accept cred and debit cards."
open-street shopping mall,"especially great after sunset. colourful and impresive. Full of people in street. There are lots of small street. there are sample of fast-food on street mid-line. they are freshly prepare the food such as shrimps, pork rib, kebab, potato and local fast food and you can eat when walking. "
Busy Busy Busy,Myeong-dong market ist so busy. You can buy a lot of stuff you dont really need but also try food you never tried befoe. Seoul has a lot of diffrent types of markets. Check it out !!
Good shopping,"Actually this the second time here in Seoul, we stayed at royal hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, really this nice area , active day ,night, skin care , food,clothes ! You will enjoy while walking here, but August not good month to visit Seoul, so hot,rain also high humidity, choose another month to visit Seoul & enjoy. Regards"
dizzying maze of goods,"Quite an experience + better if you are not set on buying stuff. Interesting street food. Well, since you WILL buy things, they are selling good-priced suitcases as well (Guess, why I know!)"
A Beauty Shopping Heaven,I visited this place almost every night during my 8 days there in Seoul. Many beauty shops and restaurants options. 
Good deals for cosmetics and fashion,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street is actually for us a web of walkable streets that have great stores and food kiosks left and right - Innisfree, Forever21, The Face Shop, optical shops, souvenirs, food like the delicious skewered meats, prawns, ice cream, milk tea - everything!The theater is likewise in this area so you can spend the day here and forget about your worries. Even the shopper with a tight budget has a lot to bring home."
"If You're Looking for Korean Skincare, This is the Place for You",All the famous Korean skincare lines can be found here. So much cheaper buying here than buying them in the US. There are also clothing stores and typical name brand stores on the street. You can also find some really good street food stalls up and down here. There is a nice taxi stop outside the Metro area. 
Great Shopping Area,"Nice environment, variety, reasonable prices, good service and great food.Definitely will come back! I recommend this place!"
Nice but too commercial,"This is probably the best street if you want to have some shopping in the very city center of Seoul.There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style. Besides prices are higher compared to the other stores and bar that you can find in the city.Very recommended to young people or to people who like this kind of commercial tourism!"
Shopping heaven ,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice. 
Paradise of Street Food,"One of the best place where to go in the night.Is the paradise of korean street food, you can try whatever you want: everything seems delicious (but not exactly cheap) ! There are also many shops, especially beauty shops (as in all cities in Korea), even if they all sell the same things, less or more. Here you can buy sweaters or t-shirts at a cheap price!Unmissable!"
Lots of shops of any kinds,"Here you can find whatever you want: any kinds of foods, souvenirs, cosmetics, toys and whatever other items you would like to bring from Korea at affordable prices. Majority of shops accept credit cards. Despite of crowds of people, no crime at all and very friendly atmosphere. Better time for visit is from 10 AM till 4 PM on working days. "
Wonderful place to wander...and eat!,"We were told that we could get a fast and simple meal from the street food trucks in the Myeongdong area...and mainly that it was SAFE to do so. The streets were mobbed with people of all ages, and the food options ranged from grilled lobster to things I couldn’t pronounce. We opted for the grilled shrimp, fried chicken, and some fruit. Not so easy to eat standing up and being jostled by the crowd, but it was worth the experience, which was so fun!"
Lots of shops open till very late,Has lots of street food stalls at night. You can try all types of korean food. Those who like cosmetics will live this place. Seoul is quite expensive though. 
Cosmetics,A lot more beauty / cosmetics shops. Affordable and tasty street food. Street food only during evening until late evening.
Hive of activity,"The streets come alive early in the evening and afternoon on Sat. Plenty of food stuff to sample and shopping to one's heart contend. Very convenient to get to by subway or buses. Be prepared to do a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothes, unless you are planning on buying a new pair of shoes or clothing there."
City lights,"Crazy shopping district, particularly nice at night with all the lights on and the street food vendors."
Everything is here,"From make up, skin care, good food and hotels - eveything is right here. This street is very convenient if you want to do everythinf. Note that the streetfood here is more expensive than streetfood elsewhere but still good to try. Try the shrimp and the lobster with cheese."
"People,People and more people ","Lunchtime mid week, it’s hot and humid. The fans are buzzing and there are people all over the place.The street has shops and it’s buzzing. I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching. I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi. A great place to wonder around."
No doubt - touristic & commercialized but still draws a crowd and worth a visit,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:1. Shop2. Shop some more3. Shop till you drop From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area."
Busy Market ,It was very busy with lots of people but lots of good street food. There is an endless amount of shops to shop in. There is something here for everyone no matter your age. I enjoyed it a lot.
Organized chaos,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos."
Shopping bonaza,"If you enjoy shopping, this is a place you needto be. The famous korean face masks of varied kinds are available in the various stores on huge discounts. And the variety of food that you can eat while u shop.. its a jaw dropping experience"
Every other shop a beauty shop??!,Busy streets with every other shop a beauty shop. In addition to beauty shops the area has restaurants and clothing stores but mostly local brands. Enjoyable to walk amidst the street food vendors and sample here and there.
Shopping Haven,"They have all the ladies (and men's) beauty products. They also have cheap restaurants, outlet stores, and other shops. This place is massive and the layout is confusing but who cares! I'm loving it. "
"Full of tourist trash and ""Sheet Masks""","Avoid this place - full of garbage trying to get tourists to buy beauty products. It is the same 5 stores repeated over and over again, all selling these packages of ""sheet masks"" for your face or your feet. They have ""foreigners only"" discounts, and try to give you a free sheet mask in an effort to draw you into their store (and if you walk 50 m there will be the exact same store with the exact same crap).If you're afraid to adventure out in Seoul and need to have a meal with the tacky tourist board and translations, then you should enjoy this street a lot."
Street market,"This is an excellent market, which has a range of stall selling a variety of food, from kebabs, dumplings, pancakes to tempra shrimps and Gimbi. At night the market gets very busy."
Good for Shopping and for food,"Myeongdong is good for shopping and for food. It is less crowded during the week. On weekends and at night, it's packed."
An awesome day shopping for beauty products and enjoying good food,"Myeongdong houses many different beauty brands close to our heart such as Mamonde, Innisfree, Laneige, Etude House, Tony Moly and a lot more! It is indeed the best place for a day of shopping for beauty products. They have many restaurants and eateries and even street food as well, so you will not have to worry of having to walk far to find a food outlet after your shopping. The famous Myeongdong Kyoza is located here! "
Shop till you drop,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here. "
Street food and trendy clothing,"Street food is not always cheap and in this case, definitely not cheap. We had dinner before coming down the street and were happy to browse the shops instead. There are plenty of choices of food and shops and you can easily spend a couple of hours roaming here."
Amazing Street Food and Shopping,I thought this was a really cool spot to check out the shopping and try out some of the street food. Tried the potato swirl on a stick and lobster with cheese. Pretty good! It’s definitely busy but worth a visit for anyone that’s in the area. 
Crowded and Busy,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture."
Delicious (But Expensive) Food Finds,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!"
Get lost but bring a map,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon. And note that most restaurants close around 8 or 9 but you can find a few open 24hrs 
Best shopping street,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD’s and other merch for very good prices. If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)"
Crazy shopping ,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff"
Best street for food and shopping,"Best street for food and shopping, u will find alot of delicious food in the street which u can grape and eat while u r shopping. Such as shrimps, fish icecream, lobster, egg sandwich... and alot more.This street is full of beauty shops. Mostly makeup and face masks. "
Spoilt for choice!,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ₩16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.
Oh yeah!!! I'll be back here!,"Paradise for a shopaholic. Many shops for every taste. Large shopping centers and small cosmetics stores. Huge selection of everything. Plus a colorful, atmospheric street with local food. I’m writing, but the stomach itself sucked. This is an amazing place!"
Extreme Shopping,The whole district is shops wherever you go food is also available specially local food. Coffee Shops are everywhere. Reasonable and negotiable prices.
Shopping And Eating Street,"A trip to Seoul will not be complete without shopping and eating along the streets of Myeongdong! As the name says, its a shopping ""heaven"" where you can go crazy over the choices of face masks they sell at quite affordable prices! From various types of street food such as BBQ Prawns, Squids, seafood, ice cream, Juice stalls, you can find quite a number of Halal stalls so Muslim readers, not to worry as they will indicate Halal sign on those stalls selling halal food! "
myeongdong shopping,Lots of street food with trendy shops. Worth checking out for some tax free shopping. Street vendors speak some English and Mandarin. 
One of the best walking streets,"The best walking street for shopping in Seoul! Hundreads shops for cosmetics, mixed with mass market clothes stores and street food!The best time to go after 6pm, in the day time there is no charm...and no street food))Recommend!"
Crowded hectic street,"It’s a fun street to stroll once, not more. Try cute and various street food and shop for cosmetics. But it is super crowded which makes it a bit stressful unless you like crowd :)"
"Tourist central, street food galore, cosmetic heaven","I recommend to come here once and only once. Come to get your currency exchange. They have the cheapest rates. While you do it, by all your skincare products and eat some street food! "
Good place to see,"One of the famous place to buy or just walk and chat with people.Crowded district where you will find everything you need or not there's a lot of shops, restaurants and you can always find what you’re looking for or what you didn’t expect to find."
Spoiled for choices,"When in Seoul, one won’t miss to visit the Myeongdong shopping streets. At night fall, the streets are lined up with hawkers offering all kinds of mouth watering local delicacies. Brace yourself for the authentic Korean flavours."
A shopper's paradise,"I went here thrice during my stay - twice during the day and once at night. If you want serious shopping for Korean makeup and skin care, go during the day when the street is not filled with food carts. At night, it can be hard to navigate in and out of stores as the crowd and get quite thick. The stores and stalls in Myeongdong sell all sorts of trinkets, clothes, bags, shoes, socks (a LOT of them) drinks and delicacies, including lobster tails!. There is a cat cafe and a dog cafe - I only went to the cat cafe and I enjoyed it! A must-go to even if you are not a Korean make-up fan."
Chaotic mess,"Shops and shops selling the same things..... Some of these shops employ ""rude idiots"" that stand outside the stores with ""fake"" gifts to entice you to go into the stores with no intention of giving you any such gift. One was shoved in my face as I walked by and as I reached for it, the jerk pulls it away and says ""come in and take a look"".. WTF?? Wanted to punch him!!"
Must visit for shopping,"Lots of shops and small shops, where you can buy almost everything, including gifts and souvenirs, good restaurants and great street food."
Everything you could want.,"There's all your usual shops down here from JD sports to Nike to cosmetic shops. Additionally there are tonnes of good eateries including my personal favourite BBQ joint in town. There will be tonnes of people, but it's not like it's tourists, it's 95 percent locals. Bring comfy walking shoes and water as the SK humidity is no joke and there's several hills in the area. There are good food places legit at every corner so just take some time to explore."
Loved it!,"Not my first visit but loved it anyway. It’s a big area cramped full of shops and stalls selling everything under the sun. Many skin care and cosmetic brands at lower prices than Singapore especially when buying in bulk. Other shops selling clothes, accessories, restaurants, nic nacs, shoes, you name it, it’s all there! More suited to the younger crowd though.Lovely atmosphere to spend an evening. "
Shopping,"If you like shopping this is the place to go .with regards to street food was NOT impressed at all .oily foods seems to take over.you get better food in small Korean restaurants close by ,and much better value for your money"
You must to visit,"Full of shops and restaurants. Interesting area to visit the afternoon, shop and dine typical Korean bbq or fried chicken"
Food and fun!,"Loved walking down here tasting local street foods, seeing the many different face mask products and trying out some very interesting tasting almonds that they seem to love here! Highly recommend spending a few hours walking around here, seeing what the stalls have to offer and enjoying some tasty foods! It’s packed but that makes it all the more fun!"
We loved this place,"So many shops and currency exchange places. Look for the currency exchange shops that are further into the shopping area. You get a better rate. For example, I used the first one I saw right by the main entrance and got 1160 per US Dollar. Further in another stall was offering 1170 per US Dollar. Is a difference if you exchange a larger amount of USC. Also so many shopping, eating, desert, food places to enjoy. We loved walking around here."
Halal korean food heaven ,Loved. Evry bit of this place very delicious food which is halal also is a blessing being a muslim traveler sometimes its very hard to find. Suitable food when ur traveling in south east Asia n mostly cant try their local cuisine but this place u can try all korean food very cheap n very clean by all means n freshly prepared loved it one of the best markets in asia i hv ever been to u can buy beauty products n get lots free samples But we went for food only for four days 
A food and make up place,I stayed at Myeong-dong and the place is best during the night when the streets are full of food stalls. And the choices of food and makeup products is vast
Lots of shops and street food stalls,"Visited on a Saturday during the day which was too busy bit went back again later in the evening when it was more enjoyable to wander around. There are so many interesting shops, lots of lovely street food and a great buzz about the place. Loved it!"
Dense & Busy,"You can shop for many different brands at Myeongdong street. (Cosmetics and fashion either)It’s always busy and fulfilled with foreigners.You will see many shops for a brand while going along, so do not worry about missing any brands. Furthermore, there was street food market at night with various choices from foods to drinks. *a bit pricey "
Awesome place. ,"I haven't been back to korea since I moved to United States 40 years ago. I was so looking forward to the visit and ir didn't disappoint. Myeongdong street was one of the places I visited and it was one of the best places I visited, second only to namdaemon market. Picked up a few gifts for friends back at the state. Anyway it was very pleasant experience. "
Overrated shopping street ,I expected much more from this place. It was basically streets of lots of facial stuff and nothing much more. The clothing and other stuff like electronics are sooo limited. Was a disappointment for me 
Shopping,"Cosmetic,local food,healty items,clothes,shoes .It's right place to find anything especially cosmetic items.However for those love to eat .it easy to find local food."
"Lots of shopping... but, same shops","This was a great area to shop. But as I went down many different streets, I saw the same shops. Stores like H&M that are anywhere, and local stores over and over. How many do you need in one area? Still, it has a nice feel if you just want to shop. I was looking for something specific and became overwhelmed by street after street of the same thing."
Nice place ,You can enjoy a very good street food or you can eat at a lot of different Restaurants.Also you have a lot of shops 
Great Lively Street,Wonderful time walking around with our family in this area. Very safe and lots of shops. Wonderful atmosphere in the evening with so many places to eat and shop!
"Street food, Shopping area, Restaurants",Myeongdong is famous for shopping and street food. The area was filled with tourists and foreigners. I loved street food but it's too crowded to walk comfortably at times.
Satisfactory,"We stayed for 5 days in Loisir Hotel (just a few steps away from shopping street), almost every day we would go here, and we can't seem to find the end of this street. I would personally explore more but since my parents' stamina is not exactly the best, moreover we brought our 20 months old niece with strollers... well you can imagine.Beware tho that this shopping street is not where the cheap stuff is. Cheap stuff goes to Namdaemun Market nearby. But if you want to experience the crowd, and want to know what's the hype all about, brace yourself for an ocean of people, smoky aroma form the food stalls, and not so clean streets. But hey, that's what we all want to experience, right? Because despite all that, we would totally go back and explore more of this infamous street."
Con un pie roto en Korea.....,"Was a magnificent arrive ,we walk from our hotel ,the Royal Seoul Hotel,enjoy the several types of snacks from street vendors,cosmetics shops,lots people speak english,you can get chips for your celular phone,drugstore at the corners ,massage feet,...Kool days..!!!!!"
Just like in the movies,"Also known for its fame, myeondong is a great place to spend your day or night shopping, one of my Favorite market place in Seoul! Myeondong is big enough for you to never get bored, it has EVERYTHING! so many shops, bars, restaurants, and food stall galore from its fresh seafood to finding a bingsu or bobba joint, myeondong offers you everything,if you REALLY LOVE SHOPPING go to MYEONDONG"
Lots of shopping,"Crowded, but whatever you want to buy in Korea from food to make up to clothes can be bought here, lots of restaurants and also street food stalls open a bit later on. Must visit if in Seoul "
Excelent way to spend your day in Seoul ,"There is a lot to do in this commercial district in Seoul South Korea. Hundreds of great fast food from shrimp tempura, seafood, pork belly and octopus skewers, caramelized plums, oh my God, my mouth is watering while i’m writing this review. From souvenir spaces to large fashion stores like H n M and so. Even an interactive racoon, cat, meerkat and kangaroo café. We had so much fun. I have to say Korean people are awesome. They’re very attentive and nice."
Sensory overload!,"With all the shops, cafes, street food, and restaurants, Myeondong is such a fun area to explore. The lights, chatter, and aroma of street food tingle all of your senses. Though a bit touristic, walking through here is a neat way to soak in some of the culture. There are many great deals on food and shopping. Especially, on cosmetics and beauty products!"
Very busy even on a Tuesday night,"This area of inner Seoul is best known for women's beauty products but I enjoyed the street food more. It was hardly bargain basement prices at KRW5000 for a small box of chicken and rice balls but since we insisted on freshly cooked, it was delicious.Appears to be a very safe area. Easily accessible by Korail Seoul Metro Line 4."
Repeat of many cosmetic stores and yummy food,Great place for cosmetics and popular clothing stores. Street Food also repeats and is ok. Fun cafes for coffee and desserts. And lots of bbq places. 
A place to buy it all,Would you be able to buy the things at a cheaper price elsewhere? Probably. Do you really want to spend the time looking for these stores? Probably not. 
Awesome street food!,"My family and I loved going to Myeongdong Shopping Street. My advise is to go after 4:00pm, when the streets are filled with street food ranging from 1000 won to 7000 won. I recommend to try anything that looks good! Our favorites were: fish cakes on a stick, barbecue chicken on a stick, tornado potato, mini kimbap, ice cream with honey comb, takoyaki, Milky bee rose ice cream, and fluffy soufflé pancakes at Innisfree Green Cafe."
Must go shopping district,"Told by others must go to do shopping. Yes you must go, the snacks, cosmetics and a very famous Michelin star Korean beef soup rice restaurant here. You can compare the price before you buy but I recommend one in the photo later. The beef soup rice is very authentic, it may be a home run business. The plain beef soup rice cost ¥12000 Korean won for each. the side dish of kimchi is unlimited supply. You pay and order before you get seats similar to any fast food restaurant. One thing is the Clinique facial cleanser at the Lotte duty free storey is cheaper than other duty free department store when you buy twin pack. But it is also available at the same price inside the airport at the gate 120 area. I must say only the Clinique brand and I don’t know other brand There is also a five storey Daiso shop with many varieties than any other Daiso so far we have visited. Lots more to tell ..... so prepared your energy to spend a day there . See below the photos of this shop, they have three shops within the district"
Great shopping and eating destination,"When you look for a place to shop and eat , this is quite a place you need to go to check out first."
Fun! ,After hearing mass in the Myeongdong Cathedral....where to next but dinner in the streets! Did not disappoint. A must do when in Seoul. 
Shop shop shop then eat,"Visited around 4pm on Saturday. Absolutely nuts - stalls everywhere, shoppers everywhere, food carts serving huge variety of street food. Just amazing to wander through the chaos and take in the scenes. Lots of cheap goods if you are looking for souvenirs from Seoul. Plan for at least an hour to wander, more if you want to eat."
Street Shopping,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is bustlingwith activity. You can't help yourself but spend some KR $ . Name brand of course. In the afternoon at 4pm is the start of all good things ... STREET FOOD. Delicious food of all things grilled or fried. I had the best Chop Chae Noodles, try it. This area is a MUST to visit. In need of a MASSAGE, there are many choices. People will hand out flyers and guide you to them. I personally tried 2 places. Both were clean and massages were good. Take your pick, it will help your aching feet and back."
Bustle area with many shops.,This place has many shopping malls. It has big department storw for who looking for elengant one. Even for young people. There are many alleys with non brands shops but quite well catch fashion people's intention. Many other cosmetetic shops as well. You can easily lost your way if you are keep walking. Please keep in mind there are a lot of turists and people who is calling you. If you want to visit quite and peaceful place this place is not for you. If you are looking for busy and comnercial area this is for you.
Interesting,"Interesting to walk between all the people, buy and see many items: Street food : fish and sea food ,desertsA lot of small stands with cloths and toysThere are big shops all around and some restaurantsFUN"
Good shops and great street food!,"Really like the shopping here, good for cosmetics and laddies clothes! Street food at night was fun to try, come with empty stomach! Be careful of people pulling you into the stores and restaurant no eye contact with them to avoid that! Goodluck"
Festive Street,"We were in Seoul in December so Myeongdong Shopping Street(s) were festively lighted up in the evening. It is perpetually crowded with tourists. It's a haven for cosmetic, clothes and jewellery lovers and if you scout around, you may get good bargains. Lots of food vendors in the streets as well. Food is pricier here compared to the nearby Dongdaemun and Namdaemun markets. Nevertheless when in Seoul, you must at least experience shopping in Myeongdong Street. A good tip is to book hotels (there are budget, midprice and luxury hotels so do your homework before you book) nearby so that after a day out and about at the sights, you can have a relaxing walkaround, do some shopping and have your dinner in this area."
Great street for night food ,Place has got tons ofLocal food and shopping on the street. Great place to spend an evening and enjoy the Seoul culture. 
Lively,"As my hotel is in Myeongdong, I walked past this area regularly. There are the usual malls, shops and restaurants. As expected in Korea, there are many cosmetic and accessories shops targeting the ladies. Not to miss are the food streets. Suggest you visit in the evening to experience the atmosphere and buzz here."
OMG I LOVE IT,"Perfect place, so much shopping fun. Lots of free samples, and all kids of beauty products souvenirs street foods. The best"
Neon vibes,"This place is just perfect for street photography especially after an evening rainshower. Other than that, there are a lot of flagship stores where you can just shop until you drop."
Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is a character place in Seoul. I have been there for the 3rd time with my two visits in Seoul. On my first visit it did not reaally make a sense to me, but it was just an ordinary shopping area full of people. My recent trip last June make me appreciate Myeongdong. Why did I say that it is a character place. From the train station you will be greated by a a foreign exchange cum shoe repair shop. The exchange rate is very good. As you go along on the alley left and right are cosmetic shops of different Korean brands. It comes to my mind why the skins of the Koreans are so clear and beautiful. Walk . . . walk. . . and at the middle you will be greated by their iconic theater, the ""I"" tourist information personnel who will assist you if you have any questions. Their is also the Myeongdong Cathedral for the spiritual side ( a must see). There are also lots of Korean restaurants that will answer for your gastronomic needs. One thing, I thought ""Daiso and Uniqlo"" is in Japan only, suprisingly I found it in Myeongdong. And if you will go into food trip (Korean food) lots of it could be found at the middle of the Myeongddong Alley. I know that for every tourist who visited Seoul, Myeongdong will not be missed out"
Awesome area,"This is most of the shops are xall kinds of shops, restaurants, bars, spas, duty free, street vendors are located. It is good to travel with family or even alone, a lot of things are going on specially at night. Bring some cash and don't get lost, it is easy to find a way out. A must while in Seoul "
Face masks,"Octopus grilled - 8000 KRWFish cake : 3000 Face masks - but 1 get 2 free (at 10000 KRW)Experience - priceless. What a lively street, id rate it very high on street food, but if you like the food experience you have to go to Gwangjang market"
Shopalholics,There are lots of foods to taste and shops are everywhere. You can start shopping at around 5:00 p.m. until midnight. 
Fantastic Cosmetics Deal,There were a lot of offers for sheet mask in Myeongdong street. Many kinds of brand and its up to individual to choose. Buy 1 pack sheet masks yang get another pack for free ending up it costs you very little. I bought quite a number and hope there will be another oppurtunity to shop at Myeongdong street again in future.
Very busy place with lots of things to do,"First off: cosmetics, you will find soooooo many brands and they have at least two to three shops in the area, so if what you're looking for is not on one shop, find the location of the other shop of the same brand. There is a tourism office near a big Global Tax Free department store and a money changer along MyeonDong Gil Street. You can get your map there.Tip: Get the freebie and enter the shop. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll buy. They give free face mask to the people who will enter the store.Next is the street foooooodss.. the main street is full of different street foods which are must try. We literally went from one stall to the other. Their skewers are great and they have lots of delicious stuff cooking.. If you like to explore street food, try everything out. Especially their very high ice cream. 52cm they say.Tip: find the ice cream store near Pretty Skin Shop in MyeonDong Gil St. it only cost 2000KRW other ice cream stalls have higher price.Cafe: there is a Meerkat cafe in the area. You can experience cuddling a meerkat by buying drinks which includes the entrance fee. or you can rest in some other cafes (there are many cafes you could choose from)Traditional food experience: you may want to go down the smaller alleys near the exits of the area to experience traditional korean food at a cheaper price in a homey atmosphere. We have eaten at a small underground canteen (can't read the signboard) which serves food for as low as 5000KRW with big servings good enough for two people.Best time to go is in the afternoon to evening, but it is also the busiest."
Hyper but not diverse,"I think I know every street here by now. It is a relatively large area with modern shops which attract mostly young people. Girls clothing shops and make up are abundant, as are restaurant and bars. I like the street food the best. There is something for every one. Nearby is the Lotte department store and posh brand section."
shops and cheap food,A must visit when travelling to Seoul. A great place to sample Seoul's street food. A nice place to shop too..
Age relevant,"If you are under 35 or shopping for someone who is, this is a 5-star shopping street. If over 35 or shopping for someone who is, go elsewhere. Noisy, crowded, oh-so-young-trendy . . ."
Shopping street,Many stores are along with the street. Nowadays many cosmetics and street food are seen. The street is for pedestrians only. No cars
Great shopping,"What more do you need, lots of shopping, lots of restaurant, plenty of beverage shops, just make sure you bring some comfortable shoes."
Shop and Dine,"Myeongdong is a wonderful district to visit with Endless shops and eateries.Lotte, Shinsegae, underground and above ground shopping streets are all in this district. Many good restaurants on Myeongdong ga-gil waiting for you to explore as well occasionally some street stalls along your way can quench your thirsty or hunger.Myeongdong station is not the correct station for Lotte Duty Free or Lotte Department Store. Don't be misled by the advertisement in the station. Take the Euljiro-1ga Station is much closer. Use Myeongdong Station exit 6 will bring you right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping streets. Here is the best place to buy Korea Snacks back home. On Myeongdong 8ga and passing Myeongdong 2-gil but before the main road Sogong-ro, you will find Lotte Mart at your left. The famous Wangjigib BBQ is also here. Lunch special up to 5 pm only 11,000 to 13,000 won. However, Lotte Mart is not the cheapest for Lotte Products. You can check Korea Mart and other shops along Myeongdong 8ga-gil. Promotions of Korea Snacks are plentiful here and sure will cause you over weight.Whilst you already reached Lotte Mart, mind as well go across Sogong-ro to Shinsegae Duty free and Department store. Since you are on Sogong-ro, at the fork, take Namdaemun-ro North to Lotte Young Plaza and further to Lotte Duty Free and Department Store.You finished off your Myeongdong Shopping Street at Euljiro-1ga station."
Quirky shops and great for skincare ,"We loved visiting Myeongdong. The tax free shopping is great, there’s great stationery shops (Art Box... go there) and the beauty scene: there’s every brand you could want in both standalone and mixed stores. It’s a must if if you visit Seoul."
Nice clean street with lotsa to see,"I stayed in the hotel at the center of myeongdong shopping street. The whole street sells clothes, shoes and cosmetics in various brands. It also has some marts, money changer, restaurants, etc. At night it has street food though there are some food are repetitive.But overall, this is a nice place to shop and eat. "
Ladies shopping heaven,"Lots of shopping for the ladies, besides bags, clothings & cosmetics you can also find Daiso, sport wear, and many dining options. Sad to say, Myeongdong is losing its shine as the place have evolved to serve tourist appetite. I hope it’s unique Korea shopping area can refocus on it’s uniqueness."
Wonderfully immersive,"Our apartment rental is right on the edge of this large night market, and we have spent our first two nights wandering through the streets here, just taking it all in. It’s full of people and awesome little shops and stalls. Just looking down the streets with all the lights and visual clutter makes you want to take a photo every five minutes. There’s nothing like this in the states!"
Great shopping district but very crowded,"I’ll always pop by myeongdong for food and shopping whenever I’m in Korea Street food are all good but definitely a little pricey as most tourists will pop by here! Overall, I still enjoy coming to myeongdong despite the crowd. It’s a place where I can get all my shopping done in a day!"
Must visit on seoul,"Heart of tourist area at seoul. Everything you could find here. From food, shopping, bar, coffee shop, etc... should stay here at least 2 to 3 days to explore."
Shopping in Myeongdong,"Walking around in Myeongdong Street Market was an experience for both the pocket and stomach. With lots of street food vendors, this will be a good time filler while waiting for your significant other while they shop. Personally, my favorite snack was the croissant stall (nutella croissant) this was was only 2500 won (2usd). Another favorite was the pork dumplings (3 huge dumplings) for 3500 won. Surely you wont go hungry while going around the street market. There are alot of stores as well with alot of varieties (fake supreme shirts, shoes, belts, bags) to retail stores (Uniqlo, ABC mart - sells shoes) this will definitely be good to go around after a long day touring the city. Stores however close early (between 9pm -10pm). The nice thing about this, you can keep coming back."
Test Your Bargaining Skills,"Shopping in this area was extremely fun, if you like to haggle on prices. Vendors almost enjoy the competition to see how high they can sell their wares to you. After proposing our final bid, the vendor scoffed at our offering so we walked away. The vendor actually ran us down and reluctantly accepted our offer! Some of the items our group purchased were; “Air pods” for $7, dash cam mirrors for $24, and an assortment of iPhone cases for under $2."
Shopping,Nice placeShop for cosmetics some shops offer tax refund and discount with a minimum 30-50k wonStreetfoodsBranded shopsBakeryRestoThe cathedral is located here
Awesome shopping ,Love the skin care products.Lovely stunning place to shop for lovely things.Crowded streets but safe lovely souvenirs to buy.
went there at least 4 times,And shopped a lot too. Be sure to get a map from the people wearing a red shirt since there are many alleys and you may get lost. Lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. There are some kpop merchandise too.
Lively with a lot of street foods,A really lively area. There are so many varieties of foods and goods to purchase from street vendors to stores. 
Beauty and fashion paradise,beauty products everywhere. You can get tons of freebies from beauty shops just by walking down Myeongdong. Lots of street food as well but a bit more expensive compared to other place.
"Snacks, shopping and deserts","Can be crowded but what's not to like. You will never go hungry along the these streets. We were there friday, Saturday and sunday night and there were the street was lined with small temporary snack shops. Bring lots of cash and have a snack fest!!!"
Shopping,"Skin care heaven, lots of street food nearby. A little expensive the street food here. A bit of clothes can be bought here. Quite expensive also. Not that cheap. But great shopping experience. "
Fun and Safe Atmosphere,"My friend and I were staying close by and we walked through the Myengdong Shopping Street daily. It was fun to people-watch and see the street foods for sale. We felt safe (as two women) walking around here, even at night."
Quick and relax 3 nights stay,"Very easy to get to, 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel. Totally different feeling when you go during the day and night. I like it at night to try all the street food too."
Crowded with many good finds,"This Street Market has many exits. My preferred exit is number 6 because it is right where Uniqlo is. However there are many street foods which really come out more at night. Is street food is not your thing then there are good restaurants scattered throughout as well as shops for clothes, facial products, or souvenirs. If you are walking all day I would recommend getting a foot massage as that really helps to recharge your feet to continue shopping all night long."
Too crowded,"Lots of street food and cosmetic stores. Very convenient. Went there but can’t enjoy too much bcoz too crowded and people makes you keep walking. A lot of cosmetic places. If you buy more than $30000, will do the tax free for you immediately. Bring your passport. Enjoyed the environment but can’t really have a mood to buy stuffs slowly. "
Good street food and cosmetics,Myeongdong is actually made up of a couple of streets not just one. The main ones and a few side streets have just about every kind of Korean street food. The shops sell mostly Korean beauty products at decent prices. There are cheaper places but this is definitely the most central and convenient.
Huge and crowded place,"This place is huge and crowded. Can find many street food seller around 3 PM till close. A lot of shops to buy cosmetics, clothes, shoes but mostly cosmetics. There are some hotels in the area too and it's easy to find restaurants. Easy to reach using bus, taxi or subway. There are some malls around the area too such as Lotte Young Plaza and Shinsegae. I'm confused why there were some cars still enter some of the streets even when there's a crowd. It's quite difficult to find thrash bin as well."
Bustling pedestrianised shopping area open till late,"Myeongdong is a signature South Korean shopping district which you will need to visit, whether you are a shopper or not.The side alleys off the Main Street offers many local Korean brands ranging from boutiques, cosmetics, consumer goods, digital equipment etc.This is a area where you see a young Korea in action. The biggest plus point is that the stalls are open till late."
Stick Food,Many stalls set up on this pedestrian street food zone that is actually a UNESCO site. They serve just about everything on a stick including the tornado potato which originated here. It's crazy crowded and crazy fun for awhile until the tummy is full anyway. I am not into the shopping however and blew that whole thing off. Many high end stores have made shopping one of the main tourist attractions here.
A must visit in Seoul for shopping and food! ,"I totally love this place. It is busy yet you have so much to see. You can find souvenirs, clothes, korean fashion stuffs, food, convenient stores, massage parlour, cosmetics and beauty products stores. Its best to come early (before 1pm) if you want to avoid crowd and the heat. I prefer coming over at night, probably after 630pm, where you have lots of street stalls selling more merchandise and lots of food stuffs. The beauty shops such as Innisfree, Nature Republic and Olive Young is worth a visit as they might have special offers especially if you buy more. This is a long street with many directions to walk about. Just take note of certain stores as landmark for your easy reference. There are some brands which has more than one outlet at the same area. It can get quite crowded at times so pace yourself. A mini usb fan will be helpful... I would recommend this as a must visit especially if you are into shopping, cosmetics and beauty, street food, fashion stuffs and souvenirs. "
Find the right price,"Items may be overpriced at street stalls. May help if you do some research on what you want to buy. Can find bargains too. Huge variety of food, clothes and shoes. Avoid if you dislike rubbing shoulders with hoards of tourists, it’s almost inevitable. Appears to be very popular with Chinese tourists. "
Crowded but fun ,Visited here several times. Street food vendors start setting up later in the afternoon offering different foods. Crowded with shoppers and tourists. Lots of stores selling K beauty products. 
Bustling Shopping and Eating Area,"We came here multiple nights as our hotel was in close proximity to this shopping and dining area. The family found cutsy accessories for school, classic KPop CDs, cosmetics and some clothing. There were both Korean and foreign chain stores here, above and below ground, and we sometime came across multiples of the same stores that were within a block or so of each other. i don’t know how each of them makes enough to pay their rents.There were also a lot of restaurants located here and we probably ate at a good number in this area. Overall many different cuisines and styles to satisfy any type of food craving.Almost every evening the streets were crowded with people and the weather was cooler which made the wandering more enjoyable."
Lots of food and clothes for sale,"Usually am not a fan of shopping but Myeongdong had many shops that sell nice food, interesting souvenirs and clothes to be brought home as souvenirs. Possible to spend the entire night here and yet not walk finish. "
Sister shopping,So much to see and taste.. could of spent a week instead of only one day. Found many good souvenirs for family and friends back stateside.
Amazing,"We love myeongdong. The ambiance of food, people and shopping was awesome. We came here everyday during our honeymoon trip. We will definitely come here again. Must visit when you are in seoul/myeongdong are..."
Holiday ,I hate shopping but this is not a place to miss just for the experience. Crowds are unbelievable and the stock on display is mind blowing. You can buy anything from genuine brands to counterfeit items. The vibe of the whole place is electric. Got to go as seeing is believing. 
Beware of scams in Myeong-dong ,"This is a reasonably fine place for some overpriced street food and shopping. Please avoid the touts on the streets who will try to entice you with some cheap massage packages. As the saying goes, if it is to be true, then it probably is. Once you follow them to the massage parlor, the sales staff there will pressurize you to take up very expensive sessions, if you are not keen, they would exert more high selling tactics. Once you refused to take up any of these exorbitantly priced session and opt for the lower price one, they would turn sulky. As it turned out, a 45 minute session became a mere 20 minute session. When I informed the staff about the session had ended way too early, the staff did not bother and insisted that it was already 45 minutes. The massage was also woefully bad. Please do not go for any massage in this Myeong-dong area. "
Best shopping place in Seoul,"For those interested in Korean beauty products, this is the place to go to. Shops open as early as 9am and close as late as 1030-11pm. It may be best to check out the different shops first and see what their promotions are so you can compare as this can differ from shop-to-shop. However, the downside though is that one promotion given today may be gone or be different tomorrow. Most shops can already refund a certain amount of the sales tax if you meet a certain amount so no need to do this in the airport. This is also the best place to get Korean street food, from fried/griiled food products to desserts. The sellers open at around 4-5pm and close at about 10pm. There are also proper restaurants/coffee shops at every corner so you will definitely not go hungry or thirsty. It is best to bring your own shopping or reusable bag so you don't have to pay for a bag from the store."
Shopping beauty paradise,"This is the most popular places now in Korea shopping district, you could see plenty of beauty shops around the area especially selling masks , cosmetic etc. At night time you can try alot of local food as see in the pictures. Beside that, there is also under pass shopping if happened rainning day you still can continue shop.There are a lot of hotels surrounding, therefore it's convenient to book a hotel nearby. Subway station also just near the area easy to travel to other locations. Bus station to airport also available in walking distance from nearby hotel.Overall, a good area in Seoul. "
Perfect for beauty product fans,"Lot's of sales, some streetfood and everything you would want to visit/have if you like k-beauty products. lot's of sale and famous korean brands for a lower price! "
Both high end & bargains,"This is the main shopping area in Seoul. If you want to get away from the high end pricey department stores, then you can come here. There are the brand shops but there are cheap stuff to buy as well."
Perfect for shopping and good street food,"This is a long stretch of street market where you can find streetfood everywhere from seafood, meat, chips, strawberries, grilled food, etc. There are lots of skin care shops from Nature Republic, Missha, Tony Moly, Etude, etc and lots for shops for clothes, shoe and some souvenir items. The skin care shops offered lots of freebies and the prices are way cheaper as compared to prices of the same brand in shops here in the Philippines. If you dont like streetfood, there are also lots of restaurant. Good to try this place. We went here for 2 nights. "
One stop shopping in Seoul ,"A must visit place if you are planning to come to Seoul. Lot of choices of items from fashion, cosmetics, foods, Coffee shops and familiar brand like The North Face, Uniqlo, Daiso and very close to Myeongdong station. Plenty of guesthouse around and also close to Seoul Tower and Seoul Station. Friendly for english speaking travellers. "
Everything you need is here,"I suggest you to stay in this area during your visit in Seoul. You can find food street at night, breakfast in the morning, good cafe, restaurants, fashion, cosmetic, hotel, and many mores. Everything you need as a traveler...even though you are a solo traveler. It has the atmosphere that makes me to return to this place again and again. "
So so!,I was a bit disappointed in this area - there are heaps of shops around but for some reason this area didn't do much for me. There are some others with more atmosphere- Hondae for instance.
Intoxicating in a good way,Love this street!We stayed in a boutique hotel in the centre of this area. Worth visiting during the night when it is fully lit.Definitely sample some of the street food on offer.
Probably the busiest street in Seoul,"Even though I hate crowded places I find myself going to Myeongdong quite often. That’s because I really like the big H&M and Forever21 stores there. Also, I guess there’s no better place if you want to buy a variety of korean cosmetics in one place. Plus, you can try many street food there. What I don’t like about Myeongdong, except for the crowds, are people advertising their makeup store with giving you “free” masks or so.. Guys, these are no free unless you buy something from their store. And the other thing is that there’s really no good restaurant there."
"Shopping, Shopping, Shopping! Korean style!","If you simply must go shopping in Seoul, this is the place to go! With all the stuff that Korea has to offer, you will find them here. Souvenirs, specialty shops, beauty products, Music Korea, Innisfree, etc. etc. you name it. What really sets this place off is during the late afternoons to evening when the food carts come in to give you a taste of Korean street foods. You can choose from a wide variety of preparation which is distinctly Korean. This truly should not be missed by anyone travelling to Seoul."
7 May 2018 first visit at this pedestrian shopping street ,"My first day of Seoul, s Korea trip brought me from Incheon Airport to Seoul railway station. Next, after leaving my luggage at the hostel, I swiftly decided to see the Myeongdong shopping street! First impression, very long and lots of restaurants, clothing shops, and souvenir shops on there! Most well known brand such as Zara, HM, and Polo were all there, furthermore, I found Miniso the Japanese and Chinese bargain shop there too! Very nice! Lots of BBQ restaurants there too! Great place. "
Great shopping,"Some of the sellers are a bit sweet/pushy for you to buy their merchandise, but nothing rude....they have a lot to offer. I did make a mistake and bought a letter opener, thank goodness they allowed it on the plane. It wasn't expensive so it would not of been a money loss just a souvenir loss. :-)"
Shopping for masks ,A good place for shopping and food. Staying near this busy street is easy for us to shop and eat. Enjoyed our shopping but realised that the shops there are selling similar stuff and so much of their touting. 
Probably one of the most lively places to shop in Seoul.,Good place to shop for cosmetic products and savor some street foods.Transport is easy with a MRT station nearby.
Great eats! Cheap prices! ,"Myeongdong is a great area to visit. Great eats. Anything tried was delicious. Egg pancakes, fresh cut fruit, steak, fries banana, tornado potato. Street food at its best. Loads of shopping. Clothes, cosmetics, skincare, shoes. Visit the cathedral as well. There is a tourism office near the Myeongdong Theatre if you need to ask about city bus tours. "
awesome shopping,"great shops, bargains galoregreat for skin care, beauty carealso with restaurants, street food to die for, hanging out to come back."
Shopping! Shopping!,"Shopping in the cold is one experience i will probably remember as my wife and daughter enjoyed a lot and did not mind doing.. It made me sick though I may probably do it with more prepared proper clothing. Lots of interesting things to see, buy and eat. Be ready to burn your wallet."
Cosmetic Heaven,"Best place to shop for cosmetics. Must visit if you go to Korea. They have a lot of discounts on different brands of cosmetics. Must visit. They have etude house shops which have good discounts. Also, the salespeople outside the shops will give you a lot of samples to try "
everything is here !!!,"good place to do shopping n food , all in 1 area myeongdong shopping market.crowded n nice environment too."
Shopping Mecca,"I don’t know if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before about Myeongdong. If you aren’t into skin care, cosmetics, fashion and Korean interpretation of current trends, visit the place anyway to experience the crowds, sample street foods and pop into the cat/dog/ferret cafes in the area. "
Best Place for Beauty Products,"A one-stop area for beauty products - Innisfree, Etude House, Olive Young, Missha, Nature Republic, Skin Food and many more. In the evening, there are many Street food stalls selling gimbap, BBQ meat, egg bread, grilled lobster with cheese, fish cake on skewers. There also other vendors selling socks, knock off designer bags and souvenirs. There are many nice cafes and restaurants along the streets."
Fabulous Food!,"My friend a and I loved wandering the streets of Myeongdong. At night the food stalls provided the ideal opportunity the try lots of different things without spending a fortune! There’s lots of lovely outdoor bars, Korean BBQ restaurants and ‘chicken and beer’ places. Shopping is good too - Korean and American/European shops as well as places to buy souvenirs. Great fun!"
Great find,So many cheap beauty products to see here and a variety of street foods to choose from. Highly recommended to purchase skin care and beauty products here.
SHOP TILL YOU DROP,"Masks and cosmetic products sold here are way more cheaper than any other places in Korea, there's a lot of Buy1Free1 promotion going on.Loud hipster musics as background.Happening street which is full of all kinds of street foods.Love the oden with toppoki at the end of the road , beside the 7-11 store.Love the environment but people here might be alil pushy if you block their way."
Loved every minute of it,"Shop til you drop, not kidding. You can stop and get a bite to eat at many restaurants and at street food vendors, and go back to more shopping. We simply loved every minute of it. So many cosmetic stores and you can spend hours there looking at so many different products. It's very reasonable there too. I bought a trench coat for only $45 and the best part is that it fits! I'm very short so most clothes need to be altered but not here in Korea. Most of the clothes were made for Asian women I think because they fit really well."
Great vibe,Myeondong shopping area is a great place to amble through day or night. The street food is amazing and incredibly good value for money. 
Myeondong Cathedral - Street Food - Shopping,Went to eat at Myeondong noodle restaurant three times. Serving is fast. Enjoyed the street food market at night and shopping with all the neon lights making the place well lighted and fun to walk around.
Redundant stores every corner,"You can count on a few things in Myeongdong-gil...- skincare stores with employees soliciting outside the store trying to give you a sample- stores and vendors selling knock-off designer bags and accessories - street vendors selling local eats- a ton of Korean restaurants - a ton of convenience stores The downside is all the stores in each category seem to be selling the exact same stuff! It’s hard to distinguish one alleyway from the next because the stores are so redundant. There’s literally duplicates of branded stores as well.All to say, Myeongdong-gil is a cool place to visit and shop but gets old after a while. Make sure you check out a Korean BBQ restaurant ...we really enjoyed them.Strawberries dipped in syrup on a stick was a cool street vendor eat we enjoyed.Check out different foods you find in convenience stores...they’re all good! Fishy ice cream sandwich below (not fish flavoured lol)"
A compact and busy shopping area,"Busy small streets at night. Lots of small shops that sells everything from beauty products, electronic gadgets, and clothes. We went for the atmosphere. The shops facade are heavily decorated with neons and lights. Feels like you're in a manga. "
Skincare shopping paradise ,"I enjoyed shopping here for 24K Gold, Caviar, and Snail ingredient skincare products. Most shops-Too Cool for School, Holika Holika, Missha, etc we’re having a sale, buy two get one free, etc. I did my research online first and if the shop sale was offering a better deal then online I snagged it. I didn’t care for the constant harassment grabbing my arms and hands to force me into entering certain skincare shops (Pink?, Skin Food, etc), but a very stern “NO” helped. I enjoyed Myeondong shopping and street food vendors; my favorite was hands down the grilled lobster tails with cheese. Definitely worth $15,000 won."
Great place to by cheap skin care products ,"We found this to be one of the better places to buy affordable skin care products like face masks, face lotions, etc. There’s also a lot of restaurants and knockoff clothing vendors. Fun to stroll around for gifts "
Street shopping heaven!,"Shop till drop! Lot of street food, shops and here you will find huge crowd. There are information people placed at random places if you need guide. You can buy souvenirs here which is cheaper. There are lot of junctions here and make sure u remember your source junction, you can be a bit confused."
Super shopping,Never seen so many shops and so many people on a saturday afternoon. Incredible. Nice and clean environment.
Nice place to walk around,"There is so much to see here. Especially the food is great! There are many shops too, mostly cosmetics stores."
Most wellknown main shopping street in Seoul,"Just around the corner from Lotte department store and Lotte Hotel. Myeongdong shopping street is the most wellknown main shopping area in Seoul, especially for ladies, old and young. Mainly for fashion, lifestyle and beauty. There are many cafes, restaurants too. The most interesting attraction might be the very propular one on instagram : Stylenanda Hotel, so named but actually not a ""hotel"" to stay, but a shop selling cosmetics, fashion clothing with a cafe, all housed in several storeys designed like a hotel and spa. The design concept dominated in pink color is interesting enough to attract younger crowd to go in and browsing around, taking photos and selfies for their instagram posts. At night the whole street is turning into a night market, with food stalls selling all kinds of food, snacks and souvenirs."
Really fun,"Lots of food and souvenir stalls, and high street shops. Bustle and hustle after 4pm. Be prepared to hunt for bins for your rubbish. We found some next to subway stairs. "
Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics,Myeongdong is for girls and women. Yes there are some nice cafes and restaurants along this area but the amount of cosmetic and make up shops in myeongdong is insanely high. The clothes shops are also primarily for women. 
Good Food,"I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls. It was primarily pedestrian access (but make no mistake, watch out for small trucks and motorcycles) and at times was very busy.Lots of food vendors of all types of street foods and most were very cheap. I had shrimp, crabs, and strawberries and all were good. The stores were more conventional brand names and there were a lot of them. It seemed popular for the younger crowd.When i went there were numerous tourism representatives eager to help. My overall impression was that it was very safe and friendly. Great place to try the street eats and maybe scope out a bargain."
A must!!,"A must see!! Full of shops and street foods to try!!This is what seoul is about! Cosmetics, food , masks, etc!"
Racist against non asian,"Nice street with almost only beauty stores with great products but beware if you are not korean or even asian you will not be treated with respect there ! We bought a lot of products and they wouldnt give us samples unless we ask for it and even when we did ask they would only give 1 small sample while they would give 10 to 20 samples (yes!) To asian people right next to us who spent half less.... Also when entering no one would come to help us, no hello, no goodbye..Even if prices were good we did not feel welcomed there... Especially at Laneige (such a good reputation oversees but it was the worst, as well as Innisfree). Tony moly and etude house were a little more open to tourists."
Don't miss this place ,"Definitely something not to miss while in Seoul. The street with the food sellers is amazingly full and interesting for someone who is not familiar with the Korean food, so this is good to see and then taste..."
Easy,This shopping street is a perfect shopping street for those who like to shop and eat at the same time without having to go any other places Can find a types of food and many cosmetics and skin care and some good brands 
My #imightSeoulyou trip,If your a make up lover then myeongdong street is the best for you. You can found almost everything and every brand you can name on. After shopping you can eat street food coz at night there’s a lot of street vendors selling foods.
Great,This place is great to walk around day or night! Lots of stalls appear at night selling food and bit and bobs. I think I walked around here everyday I was in seoul
"Indulge in the World of Cosmetics, Foods, Foods...","Was here on a weekday and the crowd was tremendous a lot and by diinner time it was more livelier with foods stalls on the streets, restaurant along the alleys and not to be missed out cosmetics outltets are plenty over here.Get your cheap face masks here....."
Time passed fast walking and eating,"Lots of shops selling food, cosmetics, clothes, accessories. Lots of choices. Street stalls also added ambience to the shopping street. If tired just hop into any korean dessert shops. "
Wild place to visit ,We visited this place on 16th of May 2019. This is one wild place to visit and I loved every second of it! There are some amazing shopping centres and a huge daiso shop with 5 floors!! I totally recommend shopping in this area if you get a chance to fly to Korea it’s a total experience to remember! 
Good place to eat and shop,The street food is great. There's a lot of places to shop especially if you're in to K-Beauty. However I would skip this place if I don't have time. Myeongdong isn't that unique - there's plenty of shopping districts like this all over the world. Most of the shops are targeted for Chinese costumers and it's always overcrowded. If you like the atmosphere I recommend Insadong or Hongdae instead.
"Lots to do and see, also eat!!!!","This is one of the most popular shopping district in Korea for tourists. Many tourists come here to try the street food, and shopping. This area is famous for yummy street food, from the start of the station exit 8 or 9 all the way straight down to the shopping areas. You can eat, get a massage, see lots of cafe, and eat desserts here. You can rest, and shop as you go; because there are many cafes around. Go here for some food and shopping fun!!!"
Crazy experience,"We stayed right next to this street, and found it a great place to explore at night. There are blocks upon blocks of streets to explore along this street. The streets are lined with vendors selling street food, socks, shoes, shirts, trinkets, jewelry, dresses, and almost anything else you can think of. On top of that, it is incredibly crowded with people stopping, pushing, bumping you, eating, and just having a good time. It was a lot of fun just exploring these streets and restaurants along the way."
Tasty street food,Very vibrant area. Really liked the atmosphere even though I am not a big shopping fan. Went there every night of my stay in Seoul to try some new Korean street food. Some good traditional Korean restaurants can also be found in the side streets.
foods and shopping!!,"you can settle everything there. foot massage is also available but did not try. full of cosmetic shops (10+10free) masks, sports wear, etc.. nice street stores available too. but you are in for a “fight” especially when there is a sales. and yes, plenty of halal foods for muslim tourists!"
Busy shopping area,"This is one of the busy and best shopping street in north Seoul, used to be for residents , now mostly for tourists; many eating places and shops. Weekend would be worst time to go."
Shopping!,"Lots of different stores, foot massages, coffee shops. Had a great time wandering around looking at everything. Cosmetic stores abound here, with people outside trying to get you to go in. Vendors selling socks, trinkets or food - always something to see. Very interesting place"
To keeo the ladies happy,"An interesting market street, good for the ladies. However, big westerners will find the trinket shops of more use. Many beauty stores for the ladies selling high quality products."
Skincare everywhere,"You could find many skincare's shop... like Nature republic, missha, the saem, etc. There are also many street foods and souvenirs. "
Shopping haven for ladies looking for skincare or makeup,"Myeongdong is filled with many different Korean brands of cosmetic and skincare. Many different price range and every outlet has different promotions. There could be another same outlet on another street so be sure to check out the promotions before your purchase. Also, consolidate your purchases for higher tax refund/ rebate. The higher the amount, the higher the amount of tax refund. Also check out the cafes such as the innisfree cafe. "
Good shopping experience ,"The street was crowded but clean. The shops were all kind. My friend got sleepy in the shop, and the they quickly came and asked if my friend’s conditions was ok or not. Very hearty experience "
Buzzing,"It's so busy, but electric for the first time visitor. It has every shop and more! I mainly wanted face masks, because South Korea has the best. You can pick up something fresh to eat aswell great place."
Amazing shopping!,"This place was just amazing shopping experience, the different types of food barbecue seafood was just amazing, you can get really good deals on items and souvenirs. It was really a sight to behold a must see."
Authentic Seoul,"If you want to experience authentic Seoul lifestyle you should stay around this area. Most historical sites are mostly walking distance or short cab ride away, and authentic Korean restaurants and entertainment venues are also nearby, lots of street foods at night. And every where you go there are always stores selling beauty products, I have never seen so many variations of facial mask until I came to this area, and these products are seems to be the best giveaways to your friends when you go back home..."
Shopping for skincare ,"Good for shopping especially for skincare, street food, cheap souvenirs and snacks! There are jewelry & sports boutiques too.. Can find almost everything but for fashion apparrel better to go to dongdaemun. "
Lots of shops,Great variety and a ton of different shops and eateries as well. Great place to see people doing street performing also.
Street food+cosmetics,"This street gets to life by evening and is busy till mid night with people selling food, clothes, accessories all at a very reasonable price. We ate a good varity of food like cheese roasted lobster, nutella pastry,BBQ chicken.. Along side we shopped cosmetic like facemask and they have most of the top brands selling stuffs at 50% (most of the time)..Happy Shopping!"
Lots of things,"Lots of things for shopping. You can find almost every brands here. Some cosmetic shop will let their staff to give you a free gift but you need to visit inside that shop. If you don’t want to visit or buy anything, better deny for that free gift. "
Experience the korean street food,"Very crowded in the evening. Good experience authentic smelling street food, that not experience in my home country. Lots of facial masks and facial cosmetics for ladies. Its a ladies world. Different mask products which is sold in discount packaging. Unless u know which product to buy, u will be totally confused. Average price between 1000 to 1500 won per mask. But if u buy like 10 + 10, the cost can be as low as 500 wong. Shop around and get the best price."
A shopping experience you mustn't miss.,"A bustling shopping area that is filled with people looking for the right bargain that they are looking for.If you love to try local / street food this is definitely one of the best places to visit. The variety of street food will surely sate your tummy. From your typical hotdog on a stick, to something more exotic like flame grilled lobsters and oysters.As for shopping, you definitely will find great deals from mobile phone cases, bags, tshirts, pants, and most important of all COSMETICS!"
Excellent people watching and street vendors,"Perhaps one of the coolest places to visit in Seoul at night. There are tons of stores too (I skipped those), and some great restaurant options. A short walk from the city center."
Great way to spend a cold and rainy day,"Had a lot of fun shopping, especially at all the K-Beauty stores. It was a really miserable day to go sightseeing, but a perfect day to go shopping. The streets did not disappoint!"
Cosmetic Shoping only here.,"If you want to you any kind of the face or body cream, mask, anything for beauty - you must to come here. Great atmosphere, lot os shops, multi choice. "
Exciting Beauty Kit and Skin Care shopping,"If you love Korean skincare or beauty products, here is the best place to go look and spend your money on it. Cheaper than in your country, all the face mask, night cream, or whatever. Not just one store, but almost all brands are here. Plus, if you start to get hungry, there are a lot of Korean food street here. The price is a bit higher than in other places in Seoul (street food) because Myeon dong has more international tourist than other places. Maybe that's why they put a higher price, but the taste and quality are the same. Just pick the most crowded food stall, they probably sell a tastier one than the other.Most hotel/hostel in Myeondong also have a higher price, I always booked into a different area and go to Myeon-dong via subway. Cheaper and faster.You might want to bring a small suitcase to buy a year worth of face mask here. Lol!"
Shop till you drop!,"Beauty products, socks with characters, shoes, street food! What's not to love about Myeongdong Shopping Street? Don't forget to bring extra shopping bags! "
Myeongdong street market,Wow. It was fantastic n with so many shops and people it makes it a bit hard to walk around and choose the shops there. You have to check one by one to make sure what is the best that you can get and it can really gets you tired. But it's worth it. For Malaysia n Muslim lookibg fir halal food there is a Malaysian restaurant naned Restaurant Kamoungku. The menu is delightful and at quite a reasonable price. Im sure to be back again at the Myeongdong Street Market
Not a best place to buy stuff,Hearing a lot of people said a cheep place to buy street food and souvenir...not at all the street food here & stuff were 2x more expensive than other major road street food. It's very crowded and noisy not suitable for big adults. My advise never to greedy of this free mask sample given out if not planing going to buy it. There will gives you sample if you are truly brought from them and sometimes u can asked extra another few more sample free from the counter (it depend shops).
Best for shopping cosmetics,"The place though congested is the best place to shop your loved make ups..You don't need to complete walking around., you can find your best items anywhere."
Nice place to shop and try all the street food,"There are many beauty product shops along the street, but not so generous in giving out sample anymore as compare to previous years ago. its getting more crowded by night as most street food vendor just started up in the evening time"
Go for the street food,"One of the places I enjoyed visiting the most. Be warned tho: It's crowded and noisy. The cosmetics are cheap, and you can buy anything here. I enjoyed the street food the most. Try it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it too!"
its Like Harajuku,"they have a lot of small stores here you can find anything you want, clothes ,shoes, bags, cosmetics, they also have street foods, a little spicy but delicious."
Have a walk around,"Have a walk around and enjoy the busy bustling atmosphere of that quarter, at 5 pm the place will be packed and people are enjoying the streetfood - surrounded by trillions of cosmetic stores "
excellent food,"it was good to do some cheap shopping with some awesome street food like lobster, shrimps, crabs, egg bread, etc"
Myeondong Shopping Street,"Easy to find things to buy here. The atmosphere is perfect for a get together, enjoying snacks or just to get the best bargains! Anyone travel to Seoul must make a pit stop here at Myeondong and shop your hearts out!"
Seoul Shopping Capital <3,"2nd time visited Myeongdong Shopping Street. Myeongdong Shopping Street is an all in package for beauty products,shoes,bags and street foods. even they have an underground shopping for kpop fan not oly for kpo fan :) but it was really nice that you can roam around and don't bother on getting bored :)"
EXCELLENT,"My hotel was just next to the busy street. It was excellently well placed. Everyday I would go out of my hotel and 10 meters away is the busy shopping street. You want food? No problem? Shopping? No problem. This is a haven for those shopping for beauty products. You could spend thousands of dollars here. I purchased food, snacks, beauty masks, socks.....you name it. Would I come again? DEFINITELY."
Ladies shopping paradise,"This shopping street is meant for the ladies, really, with cosmetics outlets all over. The night shopping sees more life with food stalls selling all kinds of snacks . The food outlets and cafes can be found at the side streets and are plentiful. Be prepared to queue to get in, which seems to be a standard practice here. All the stores have mandarin speaking sale staff who can converse in English too. So much of the bargaining can take place quite comfortably."
Repetive,Visited this shopping street and found it very similer to Shinsaibashi in Osaka JapanMainly cosmetic shops selling all the same stuff shoe shops convenience shops and eateriesEach street in the area the same
Bargains galore!,"As a keen lover of Korean Beauty, this was HEAVEN! The prices are much cheaper than back home in Australia and there is so much variety! A quick google told me the “must haves” and these were so easy to find.Olive Young is like a Korean version of Priceline that we have in Australia and there are great brands available there and many sales or promotions going on. If you like skincare and cosmetics, THIS is the area you need to shop in!"
Capitalist madness!,"Myeongdong is absolutely batshit, and in the best way. It's crowded and lively, with a bewildering selection of shops, cafes, and restaurants. There's underground shopping as well as street-level, but don't forget to look up: most commercial buildings in Seoul have shops on the second, third, even fourth floor. If you're looking for skincare, nearly every top Korean chain has multiple stores here. You'll find Western fast food, international restaurants, Korean BBQ and dumpling places. Anything you could possibly want to eat is somewhere in Myeongdong. Some of the best K-pop music stores are here, as well. Plus a big movie theatre. You could spend days here and not see everything. When you need a break, sit and relax a while in a tea cafe. And then, as evening comes along, start all over again, because at night, the broad main streets become packed with vendors selling souvenirs, gadgets, and every conceivable kind of street food you've ever heard of. Fair warning: a lot of it can be greasy and messy, and there are very few trash cans. But most vendors will take your discarded napkins and skewers and dispose of them for you when you buy your next treat from them. And it helps to have extra napkins and perhaps hand wipes handy. The digital screens and neon everywhere are dazzling, and people-watching is delightful. Have fun!"
A must try,You simply have to go here if it's your first visit to Seoul. This is a beauty mecca for all beauty enthusiasts. All the big k-beauty brands have several flagship stores in this area. They are side by side as long as the eyes can see. If you buy bundles you can get discounts. And whilst you're there don't forget to try the delicious street food.
Good place to shop and eat,Stayed around the area..did not manage to walk around the whole place but did get to smell and eat the street food. Wonderful experience. Lots of yummy food to taste on..eg lobster tail with cheese..honeyed strawberry and grape..etc. A lot of cosmetics ..souvenir shops. It is really a fashion and eat street. Tried a restaurant which served abalone porridge..chicken buloggi porridge..etc. Yum..porridge served with kimchi..literally everywhere. Will definitely spend more time there; in future visit.
It’s a dangerous place for a shopaholic:),"There’s all kinds of street food, endless rows of skincare and make up shops and shops that sells cute socks and accessories. I actually went there with zero intention to buy anything but still ended up with skincare and socks for family and friends. If you’re looking to purchase Korean skincare, this place is great. There is sometimes good deals like ‘buy 1 free 1’ deals and always ask the sales people for free gifts and samples. Also remember to ask them for tourist tax refunds. "
Not as good as it use to be.,"This place can get really crowded at times. There is an over abundance of shops selling woman’s beauty items. Many Chinese visitors shopping for everything. If you look you can find restaurants throughout the area, but many are on the 2nd or 3rd floors. You get what you pay for. Some of the more expensive restaurants will come with several side dishes which were so common a decade ago. Some street food vendors sell, but have no place to set and enjoy what you have just bought.Still a good place to visit, wear your tennis shoes, bring your camera and have a good time."
"Wonderful, hectic street shipping","You can find almost whatever you're looking for in these streets as well as Shingsae department store. Everything from street food to, socks, t-shirts, electronics, supermarkets, desserts, restaurants, etc.Stroll worth the trip."
Crowded and bustling in the nighttime,"I went back there thrice because of the free face masks and the buy one, take one offers. I was disappointed when I got to the Incheon airport and found that the cosmetics sold at the Duty Free shop were cheaper and that the shop was more generous with the giveaways (They didn't just give away sachets. They gave away bottles of gel and cream!)I went crazy with the food side stalls at Myeongdong as well only to realize that 5 mins walk away at Namdaemun market the same treats were sold at 1/3 the price! But that's a tourist market for you. I don't regret going to Myeongdong but I do regret spending so much money there. Hahaha."
Nice street food,Tons of street food and shopping. Kind of confusing to walk around but we still enjoyed it here. Definitely a must do.
Must visit in the evening,"Walking the main street and the many side streets in the evening is a never-to-be-forgotten experience. The streets are packed with people out shopping and eating at the very many street vendors, all at incredibly reasonable prices. And, oh yes, the main departmental stores are pretty good, too, for example Lotte which covers two blocks."
Shopping for korean skincare,Mainly for korean brands of skincare. Lotte dept store is here too. Streets are lined with all sorts of korean brand. Street food in interesting to try.
Visited Several Times,"Yes, it was touristy, but we LOVED it! We went with a group of young ladies who loved the beauty and clothing stores. My husband and I enjoyed the street food the most and spent our time eating while waiting for them. We ended up visiting it several times on our trip to Seoul."
good for shopping,"From high-end to cheap products are offer in the market.Good place for shopping Nike, Fila, Topten,.. Good quality"
Pricey but worth the experience,"This place is for food enthusiast and shoppers. Nice place to shop whilst eating korean specialty crayfish, or an octupus on a stick... lol. We spend around $50 the first nyt and we keep craving for more stuff.. following night we ate at the resto. Kinda busy atmosphere on the street at night. Worth an experience..."
Myeongdong subway station is the hidden germ!,"As per title, myeongdong street is popular with thousands of fashion line, food,kpop goods and many more. But bear in mind, that these item nevertheless a quite pricey esp if you don't know how to bargain. They been selling almost similar item from one stall to another. But its a fun street to explore thou! But, i found if you plan to shopping and still find it reasonable, go to their myeongdong underground shopping centre! similar items up there slightly cheaper and more CHOICES. hehe. You can buy something for everyone besides keychain, their collections of socks is amazingg. from disney cartoon, nickelodeon you name it.The material is nice and only 1000k a pair. Happy explore!"
Crazy crazy place,Its so crowded but nice place to try some street food although it is not cheap there. Also its good for last minute suvenir shopping :) 
A really happening and fun place to go,"This is definitely one of the places where tourists should go! It has nearly everything.. From shops to stalls. Even cute cafés! For the Muslim travellers, there are also some halal food vendors so there is no need to worry. Best time to visit would be during the afternoon, in my opinion. And the stalls are usually up by late afternoon as well. Its also a nice place to just walk around and window shopping as well! "
Famous area for tourist,"Who doesn't love shopping and eat ? I think most people love this 2 things right ... Myeongdong is the right area for shopping especially skincare and cosmetics, street food hunter and entertainment. Well, there are also some duty free malls which sell high-end brand. Very crowded with tourist. But i prefer Hongdae rather than Myeongdong."
a big market indeed ,"with number of stalls and shops where you could find various local things, a lot of restaurants too, easily spend few hours here, connect to luxury shopping malls that suits all you need, good for all travelers for a visit"
Do you need cosmetics?,"Face masks, feet masks, hand masks and everything else you need to look and feel great will be found here! There’s the odd clothing store and some restaurants, but it’s predominantly cosmetic shops. It’s hustling and bustling and everything you expect of a major Asian city!"
Never ending cosmetics stores !,Fascinating place to visit and experience the overwhelming South Korean cosmetics industry .... briefly.
Great shopping area but watch out the expiry date of product,"A very great location for shopping, where many popular masks, skin care products, bathroom products, foods, fashion clothing, almost every thing you need is available there, including baby needs & supermarket. Only thing need to highlight: bring umbrella along, there is no undercover. No baby chair to be provided in 9/10 restaurant."
Lots of food and shopping around,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund by showing your passports when shopping at some outlets. Conveniently located with Underground shops and subway stations nearby. The beautiful Myeongdong Cathedral also located here."
Real Seoul,"Before my visit, i always imagined Seoul exactly that it looks like in Myeongdong street. When i first time saw this amazing night street view of Seoul I ultimately fall in love with this. People always have some expectations about something. I had about this asian metropolis city own expectations. And when the time has come i saw it, i felt it...P.S.: i think, it is better to visit this place when the Sun goes down. "
Still the best place in Seoul for me!,"Myeongdong is a must visit for us everytime we visit Seoul. We love the food, hype, and crowd here. We were finally able to try the torched marshmallow with ice cream filling! Yes!!! "
Awesome!,Nice area. Everything is there. Food is great! All types of food. Various restaurants and street food stalls. Shopping is all around you. What else can I say? 
Shoppers Haven,"You should never miss Myeongdong when in Seoul! It's a must visit place where you can purchase cosmetics at a very affordable price. There are also ""samples"" in almost every store so do not hesitate asking for it in exchange for a quick visit inside their shop. There are also restaurants, shoe stores, malls, and STREET FOODS! A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit to Myeongdong."
A must go when in Seoul,"Bustling place with lots of street food, restaurants, cafes, local eateries, beauty products, etc. A good place to replenish facial and beauty products at good prices."
Shopping,"There is a lot of creative street foods along the street and the street shop at night time. The night time is more alive than the day time. There is a lot of Korean cosmetic shops, Korean fashion, and restaurants."
Shopping and Street Food,Went to Myeongdong in the evening. It was bustling with people and very alive. You have the regular shops and brands as well as stalls selling local Korean food. It has a lot of side streets to explore so be sure you have your walking shoes on. Great fun!
Beautiful shopping district ,"Beautiful shopping district, mixing famous clothing brands with many many local beauty/skin care brands.In the middle, many little area where people cook local food"
"Classy Street Food , A Heaven for Cosmetic lovers","Facial care and cosmetic enthusiasts , this is for you . Almost any available international and Korean specialty brands can be found here. At cheaper prices at that. In almost every corner you will find something. That’s aside from several souvenir shops , convenience stores , mini grocery , and stalls selling knock off designer shirts . Street food kiosks sprout from late afternoon. These items are not that basic , selling abalone , scallops , crabs and lobster among others. Choose your fave food , you won’t be disappointed. But the prices are not cheap. Yet I loved it. Included some photos ."
nice place with its bargain finds,"Shops can be found everywhere. I find this place more affordable than the the other shopping areas i've been in other countries. Beauty products are affordable. Bags, souvenir items are likewise at fair prices. If your objective in visiting Korea is to shop, then this place is for you. Street foods are everywhere, a taste of Korean and other selections as well. "
Beauty Care Product Dream,"My wife and daughter absolutely loved this shopping district. The South Korean women take their beauty seriously and this is a dream street for purchasing anything you need to take care of your desires. The district is chock full of quality stores, the streets are vibrant and clean and there is plenty of street food.Crazy experience when a couple approved me to take a 'selfie' with a Westerner! Had a great laugh."
Good shopping place ,this place is very good for shoppers and for those who would like to experience street foods in Korea. We also watched a funny show in this place where they use kitchen utensils as musical instruments. I would compare it to Ximending night market in Taiwan but more affordable.
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a shoppers' paradise especially for skin care and make-up products. The shopping area mainly features Korean brands like Etude zHouse, Tony Moly, Missha, etc. We bought Tony Moly skin care products for anti-aging and skin peeling and also cushion powder. During our visit, Tony Moly was on sale. It was good buy. And we found out that the Tony Moly products we bought in Myeongdong are not available Tony Moly here. At 4 pm, street foods lined up Myeongdong streets. And this made our Myeongdong shopping adventure more enjoyable."
Visitor paradise ,Visited myeongdong. Its a paradise. Street food everywhere. Cosmetic product are everywhere and cheap too
Shop til you drop,"One of the most popular places to shop in Seoul. I like getting cosmetics and skincare here because most of the brands are in this area. Every shop is almost a skincare/cosmetics store which makes it really convenient.In the evenings, the food stalls start to pop up. Walking down and sampling street snacks is always fun. Myeongdong is quite a touristy place especially at night with the crowds."
Shopping & Food Paradise!,Myeongdong is a must visit when you are in Seoul. It literally is a food & shoppers paradise! So many shops to visit and the variety of food is endless. Do go with an empty stomach so you can try all types of delicious food here. You should allocate at least 3 hours to walk around this area. The shops are endless and you can get lost. Have fun & happy shopping & eating!
Busy shopping street,"It is always filled with crowd and during our stay, there was a fan-signing event. This street is always a great place to stop by especially if you're into street food."
Shoppings free!,"Recommended for all ages, cosmetics, facial care, clothes, bag, shoes and street food. Don’t miss the Almond nuts and variety of seaweeds (flavored) snacks. "
Great area to shop,Good luck trying to find a mAp. This area is huge and expect to get lost. Some famous brands...sneakers and make - up/ beauty products are cheap.
AWESOME SHOPPING AND FOOD!,"This is by far the best market in Seoul. Street food AMAZING! Shopping INCREDIBLE! We spent a majority of our time exploring this place, WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT!"
Shopping Street of Korea,If you love shopping this is definitely a place that you cannot miss. There are hundreds of shops in the area. Famous Brands as well as local brands....as usual there are so many skin care shops. And I in the late afternoon until evening they sell street food.
Would always love to come back!,"It is very famous of its street food along the alley ... they offer variety of local dishes, and the tteokbokki was really nice. The one that is super delicious is the freshly made strawberry mochi. Lots of interesting shops along the way to satisfy your shopping needs!"
Enjoy food and shopping ,"Like many, come here, eat a lot of food, like most grilled shrimp. And lots of sales Like most grilled shrimp and glad to have shoes that you likeToliet available in shopping mall beside road"
Shopping spree,"We only had 2 hours to visit this place but its definitely not enough to visit everything here. There are a lot of make-up/beauty stores, street food stalls, food, clothing and souvenir shops in here. If you get hungry, there are also a lot of restaurants here. ATMs, banks and foreign currency exchange centers are also here."
Great Shopping place ,Great shopping place for cosmetics & sports wear. Plenty of food outlets and snacks stores. Spoilt with varieties of snacks in these stores. Do shop around for bargains.Stay on for the nite market where St foods is a must try. Do remember to pack warm clothes for the nite mkt(springtime is still cold at nite).If you are looking for F&B outlets do check out on the upper floor signage since the outlets are mostly on 2nd flr.
Busy Shopping Places,"It is very busy everyday, full of tourists. Restaurants, beauty shops, street food (evening) every way. Can’t speak Korean no problems, the sales people can speak English, Chinese & Thai. Try the banana milk if you are in South Korea, is quite popular among tourists. Also try the ginseng chicken soup not bad. "
Lovely Area to Wander and Eat ,We stayed Nearby and loved the walking in the evenings before and after dinnerA must try is the cheese lobster or fried chicken or tornado potato sticks or even the cuttlefish Must not miss eating the strawberries either in a cup or on a stick with chocolate or cream they are absolutely yummyDrinks walk along and you will have fresh orange or pomegranate juice 
Great Place to Visit!,Variety of choices of beauty products and foods and snacks!Love this place and for sure will come back again!It's a must visit place in Seoul!
Best shoppingn place ,During our stay we went here 3 times to shop. Its a shop till you drop area from restaurants to stalls and boutiques fro shoes and cosmetics. Cosmetic shops will offer you face mask and you just accept it and enter their shop without even buying or if you buy you just have to haggle . I would definitely recommend this area if you want to shop till you drop. Its just 2 stops from seoul station and actually accesible to all stops. They close by 11:00 pm every day . 
Great shopping ,"So many great shops! I enjoyed walking around this area. There are many skincare shops like Innisfree, Nature Republic, Skin Food and Etude House. Uniqlo, Zara, Guess, H&M and Forever 21 are also in the area. There are also 2 huge Daiso’s...3 floors! I also fell in love with Artbox. I also had the most amazing pancake with honey from one of the food vendors! The shopping street is accessible by the Myeongdong station. "
Must go in Seoul,"You can get street food, facial masks, sports apparel here. Zara, H&M, Uniqlo are also located on this shopping street. Lots of promotion for the facial products. Selling one for one - good buy. A must go place in Seoul. The later it gets, the crowded it is so do go earlier to avoid the crowd. "
Seoul Shopping!,"I love shopping in Myeongdong! My boys and I tried their street food and it was delish! The place kinda smelled different tho but it was fine, we had an awesome shopping experience. I wish we had more time spent there. Oh well, always a next time "
A Highlight experience not to be missed,"When in Seoul you should not miss the Myeongdong district for shopping especially the famous Korean brands and also Korean street food. Here you will be flanked by rows of street food some Korean dishes and some international such as Churros, crepes, kebab. I love the strawberry mochi with red beans. There are also many shops for clothings and Korean cosmetics. However it’s very hard to find a dustbin. Therefore if you are going for street food, do be sure to carry a small bag to dispose garbage."
A must visit place for tourists,The place seems to have more tourists than locals. It is a must visit place when coming to Seoul. Plenty of shops and foods in a street maze. Easily accessible by train.
Korean Cosmetics and Street Food!!!,"Highlight of our trip! Our hotel, L7 Hotel is very much close to this area so we had no trouble of finding a place to eat! Every night, we tried different food, from grilled cheese clams to fresh strawberries dipped in syrup! Shopping is pretty much covered also, there are a lot of bargain stores you can get snacks for gift-aways for friends! And of course, face masks everywhere!!!! "
Clean,This place is the same like we have in the Philippines. It has too many people walking around like divisoria but the only difference is its safety. Food street stalls were clean and delicious. Shopping stalls were great. 
Great shopping area with street foods ,"Busy shopping district with many branded stores, skin care, food market. Also got tons of street food stalls to enjoy small bites of Korean food. There are also tourist information staff to ask for directions from, very thoughtful gesture. However keep in mind that the foods may be a bit pricey coz this is one of the tourist attraction."
High end shopping,"Myeongdong is a place for not also for buying a beauty products but also for the delicious street food. We even tried the taiyaki, a fish-like cake with cheese filling inside."
Plan before shopping ,"I love cosmetics and fashion. But I still wish that I had done more research. The area is very exciting-lots of tourists and shoppers. You can get really cute cheap clothes, tourist souvenirs and lots of knock off goods but the focus of this shopping area is cosmetics. With all of the instagrammable spots and street food it is a little bit difficult to actually shop for cosmetics unless you know better what you want. I suggest researching the main brands. innis free. Etude House, Stylenanda, skinfood, nature republic, Artium. These cosmetics houses have real deals that will translate into fun shopping if you know what you like and what products are truly not distributed world wide. Otherwise the appeal for most shoppers is the duty-free aspect. I personally don’t travel all around the world just to fill my bags with items that I can order on the internet or purchase otherwise paying a reasonable tax for merchandise. Olive young is a fine place to buy more Korean cosmetics from the Lines you can find online. Personally I watched a lot of YouTube’s and researched which Korean brands have the least problematic additives preservatives. We figured out that both my daughter and I like “too cool for school” so we just two bought two of everything in the store that caught our eye and then let the staff give us lots of free samples of everything else. I also bought a lot of dr. Jart masks at Olive young only to find that some of the other shops on the street offered Dr. jart masks discounted. There are young college students who volunteer as tour guides. They were standing in the major intersections. We talked for a long time with “ Zoe” who offered us lots of advice and friendly conversation about our travels even though we decided not to take tour. Furthermore we came back to one of the money exchange places closest to the walled embassy of China ( from the Lotte young plaza go down the street to the right of the Zara) more than once as it offered a significantly better daily rate of exchange. Myeongdong was a good place to find korean food. Many good choices for desserts binsoo and chimaek and soups/stews. I would go elsewhere for bbq. "
Pricey,I used to eat one of the restaurant here and it was great even if this is a famous shopping street and a little bit pricey even in the subway market still you can count on this place.I used to widraw here in standard charter that cannot accept on other banks.
Vibrant busy street,"Very busy street but full of people, shops, market stalls and food. Lots of tourists and very crowded but this just adds to the atmosphere. Lots of delicious food to pick from with fantastic vendors very happy to help with non Korean speaking tourists."
Well worth going to have something to eat ,This was a great experience and so glad to go . We walked from our hotel in the early evening so many food stands. I highly recommend the lobster with cheese and the deep fried shrimp. We had to go back three times to be able to try lots more. The Oreo cookie churro is good as well. Make sure to take this activity in on your busy.
Best Street Food!!!,"Amazing selection of Street food! Must try the cheese balls, fish cakes, 33 cm soft serve ice cream, and strawberry mochi (5 stars)!!! I had the cheese scallop too and it was awesome! Myeongdong is best for food!"
Skin care paradise ,"If you are a fan of korean skincare all of their store is available here, not only one but multiple. "
Full of goodies!!,"Myeongdong is the place to be for skin care products. Prices varies from $1- $$$. Morning is better quality time for shopping, night time is super pack with tourists, street food are awesomely yummy and bargain items are everywhere."
Amazing,"There are many cosmetic stores. It’s fantastic. At night , there are many street foods. Roast lobster with cheese is very delicious. Yummy!"
Loved it.... so many shops and foods to choose from,"We returned to Myeongdong a few times during our stay. Mostly for the food and to buy socks. We loved the area, the atmosphere and the sites. "
Busy place,"Lined with cosmetics & skin care shops, one is spoilt for choice. In the evening, stalls are open selling street food. Interesting array of street food available. A most-visit place to load up on skincare products, shoes & clothing. "
Lots of makeup / skincare shops,"If you are looking for korean makeup and skincare brands, just come to Myeongdong.- you name it, they have it. Very crowded especially in the evening with street vendors selling finger food, t-shirts,bags and accessories. A vibrant shopping street worth visiting."
Shop till you drop!,"A haven for all cosmetic & skin-care products! and the local street food in this area is the best, though it can be pricey on some. lol."
My Myeongdong Experience ,The streets were so full of people but it was really clean. Plus it is safe to roam around the streets. 
Amazing market!,This market goes on and on and has even more at night when the street food starts. Just amazing! We found some excellent deals on clothes and cosmetics and enjoyed the unique cafes and foods. This was our favorite market in the city. 
Shop till you drop!,"This is what street shopping is all about. From cosmetics, clothes, shoes and many more! The place turn alive from 5pm onwards. With the neon lights from the shops and many food stalls, you wont leave this place hungry. For Muslim travel, you can eat at Halal restaurant name Busan Jib. The shops is located in small alley on your right side."
Crazy street,"This is the best street in the heart of Seoul. Popular for its street food and shopping. Walking in this crowed street is itself fun, mainly at night. A must experience while in Seoul."
A must-see experience for any trip to Seoul.,"Nice selection of street food in the evening. Small, quaint streets with a lot of shopping options. Best time to arrive is late in the afternoon."
"Fashion, Skin Care/Makeup, and Food all in one place!","Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, skin care products, and clothing. But the best part I enjoyed here is the row of streetfood that line in the middle of the street, which aren't that expensive. Great to go here during the late afternoon to evening. You can easily spend much time and money going around this place and enjoying yourselves."
Cosmetic paradise,"It is a great place for cosmetic shopping but anything other than that are kinda expensive. My korean friend told me even the Koreans themselves don't really come here. If you want to buy clothes, kpop merchandise, or souvenir go to Dongdaemun area or Nondaemun Market."
Worth going for the food alone!,"We only went by in passing on our way to the ""Cookin' NANTA"" show, but wish we spent more time and was more hungry when we were there! We aren't really big shoppers when we travel, but it was interesting enough to window shop and is worth going for the food alone. It was busy and crowded when we went on a Sunday afternoon, but was clean and felt safe even with young children. Even people with food allergies (e.g. my wife is coeliac) should be able to find something they feel safe eating.Tip: apart from public transport, this is where we spent most of our cash in Korea - everywhere else we could use card. Bring at least 5000 won per person for a snack."
Shopping,If you are looking for something you can find it in this area. There were shops and people everywhere. 
Tourist spot,"Good place to take a walk if you're not doing anything else. I would go here just for the atmosphere and the food stalls that line up around 8pm, but there are rich opportunities for shopping as well. "
Amazing!,All kinds of street vendors. Food galore. Clothes. High end stores. Street food. Restaurants. Shops. Flea markets. It is all here.
The shopping paradise for Kbeauty,"This is a must for kbeauty lovers. It`s possible to find anything of any brand you want. There is a ""All mask store"", that sells a lot of kinds and types of mask, facial, hand or foot mask. And there is a lot of street food, that is also delicious. Super must place to go."
AMAZING shopping street in Seoul,"Myeongdong shopping street is one of the best shopping streets in Seoul. There are a wide variety of shops here, including a FILA megastore, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas Originals, Nike, GUESS etc. Asides from many clothing stores, there are also many face care and make-up stores which have very good deals.

Beauty and Skin Care Heaven,"For the ladies who love the Innisfree, Missha, Skinfood etc, this is the street you will be super motivated to come.

Nice place to walk around,"Many restaurants and shopping outlets here. Come in the later afternoon and there will be street stores selling food, clothing and snacks."
High Energy Shopping Street- Sea of People,"If you’re into street food, shopping, large crowds, high energy, or traveling with no kids, Myeongdong will suit your needs. If not, you might be overwhelmed and I don’t recommend this destination. This area is filled with tourist crowds all battling for the delicious street food. Each food vendor are $5 to $10 that varies from deserts to seared scallops. If the food vendors doesn’t hit your wallet, the multilple storefronts will. Want to shop for sneakers, clothes, beatufy face masks, or color contacts? This area will serve your shopaholic needs. Bear in mind, this place is very touristy."
Vibrant! ,"Located near Myeongdong Station, the area has many shops and restaurants.you can find most Korean skincare and cosmetics brands here.

We spent many days here and found some really cool clothes and makeup we'd never find back home. I recommend coming once during the day and once at night- you have to see this place lit up!"
Cosmetics Haven,"Other than that, the night market is filled with vendors selling clothes, street food and souvenirs.The clothes and souvenirs IMHO a bit pricey due to the place being frequented by tourists.As for the street food, you may just want to indulge eventhougg they may not be the tastiest. "
"Food trip, sightseeing, shopping","You decide why you will visit Myeongdong but whatever your reason may be, this is a must place to see in Seoul.Yes, it is crowded but this adds to the vibe of the place. This is also very accessible via the subway line."
STREET FOOD! ,"If you are a food lover, you must check this place out. The vendors starts setting up around 3-4pm and it’s open until around 10pm. There’s also a lot of stores to shop around. "
Lively & exciting ,Love the street food stalls at night though they are not necessarily cheap. There are plenty of skincare & cosmetics ships offering discount. The only watch out is not to be touted and be sure to buy only what you need. The shops will try to throw in all kinds of deals & freebies to encourage you to buy more. There are also many nice restaurants offering a lot of dining options. Great place to hang out at night. There is a street for having Chimac ( Korean fried chicken & beer). 
Myeongdong Shopping Street - Good street food and great shopping awaits ....,Myeongdong literally 'bright cave' or 'bright tunnel' but it is really nothing like a cave or tunnel but it is bright all right. Bright all night with the wonderful aroma of street food and great shops for good bargains for all things under the sun.
Entertaining ,"This shopping street is one of the crowded or busy street in South Korea. Famous for its local cosmetic product where you can get a very cheap price and good offer. They also sell cheap brand of shoes like Fila,Sketchers and a lot more branded product"
Best place ,"I went three times i always stay in this area its the best place for families, friends ,and couples."
Didn't spend enough time here.,"Lots of stores both bright and pokey to gander at. We only had a short time, I had to get back to return the Hanbok that I had rented. I bought a few things here and the prices were affordable and reasonable. The smaller pokey places had better prices than the bright . Also some great street food and people were super nice, though that could be because I was an older blondie in a Hanbok."
Money keep disappearing,"When I arrive at this place, I have money in my wallet. By the time I left I am so much poorer but my wife is very happy"
Lively place with plenty of retail n food outlets,"This place was bustling with people at the night we visited. The crowds went for shopping ( cosmetics, souvenirs,etc) , food ( Koreans n international) and entertainment ( theatre, pubs n karaokes).This place is near metro station and is very accessible, a must for all visitors who want to feel the busy pulse of Korea in the evenings."
Great atmosphere ,This street is brilliant with so much excitement . It’s a must see during your visit especially at night . 
Heaven ! ❤ ❤,"My guest house is near from this area, so i came here everyday on my trip. It was a place with korean skincare everywhere, korean streetfood everywhere, and some branded stuff official stores too. It's a shopping heaven !But compare to Ewha and Itaewon, Myeongdong is lil bit more expensive. So be careful to spend your money in Myeongdong."
"In 5 days in Soul, we went here 4 times!!!","I have 3 daughters, 1 son, 1 wife. My wife bought all those masks... masks for ever single part of your body that you can imagine!!! My 2 teenage daughters did the same this and then all four of them bought clothes, blouses, pants, skirts, jackets... a lot!!! Me and my son enjoyed tasting all the street foods that start opening up at 5pm. Delicious!"
Best shopping street ,"This place is very good to shop but a bit touristy . If you don’t mind it, it is very good and you can get everything there. "
Awesome for Tourists,"You can get all your traditional korean food and snacks here. Rows of make-up and skincare products boutiques. They have big supermarket there too, where you can buy local snacks souvenirs. If you want proper restaurants, they have it there too. "
Things are over priced ,"I found things are overpriced compared with other shopping’s street. Well, there still a lot of entertainment for your view. "
Fun Street Market...Pushy Sales ,"Great street market that is located steps away from downtown Seoul. There is so much here that it’s hard to sum it all up.Face masks? You will get “pushed” face masks by almost every shop. Actually gets annoying after a while, but heck...we bought 100 face masks. Our faces better be silky smooth :)So much food options! You’ll have a great time trying the different vendors or restaurants in Myeongdong. We tried tons of different places and all were very tasty...not one bad experience.This is for sure an experience you won’t want to miss! Happy travels!"
One of Those Uniquely Korean Experiences,"We last visited Myeongdong four years ago, in summer, with an adult daughter in tow, who wanted to visit seemingly every single outlet on the street - an interesting but rather exhausting experience.This time around, in much less busy February and with no pressure to buy anything specific, we found it a much more enjoyable experience, just ambling along and watching life going on all around us. There is every conceivable cosmetic store here, sometimes multiple branches just a few hundred meters from each other - just in case they don’t tempt you in the first time - interleaved with fashion stores, shoe stores and sportswear mainly.Many of the stores have ‘Greeters’ outside, whose job it is to persuade you in. There are also lots of people with flyers for such things as massages, cat cafes etc, which are located just offering the main shopping streets. You do need to adopt a firm stance.There are lots of good offers on cosmetics, which are of high quality in Korea. Many stores will give you samples too although, as an ‘Aajuma’ who clearly doesn’t wear make up, I don’t seem to fit the criteria, or perhaps I just didn’t spend enough! When we were here with our daughter she almost had more samples than purchased goods.Obviously the character of the shops within these streets are aimed at particular tastes and interests but, even if you aren’t specifically going to buy something, this is a uniquely Korean experience, and you might just find something that you had no idea you needed."
nice place to visit at night,This area become street food many small stands sell food and other thingsAt night the lights are beautifulat day hours you can visit the shops
Myeongdong shopping,"Myeongdong is an area which becomes lively full of shopping goods and foods at night. There is also a famous church there, the myeongdong cathedral. This place cant be missed when you visit south korea."
Shop till you drop,"Our accommodation was just a walking distance to Myeongdong shopping market wherein every night we go there to eat a lot of street local food, branded items on sale and choose to a variety of skin products. Prices were really affordable and if you shop a lot you, tax refund at the airport is possible."
Food lover's delight - street fair,The Myeongdong shopping area is an open air mall with hundreds of small food merchants in the sidewalk - every kind of imaginable food - very reasonably priced - instead of a meal at a restaurant I enjoy eating a bunch of different small portions from a variety of merchants - delightful
Avoid unless you’re going for something specific,"Tacky, overpriced and overcrowded. It doesn’t seem to be too much different from any shopping thoroughfare anywhere else in the world - it could be Tokyo, New York, London or Beijing, were it not for the korean lettering everywhere. Unless you have a particular desire to spend too much on substandard fare, avoid."
Great evening out!,We took a few hours out to walk the district. Thete is a wide variety of great street food to enjoy and many and varied shopping outlets too. There was a throng of tourists from all over the world this night. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and highly recommend this activity.
All the lights and sparkle ,"Myeongdong is fun, have your wits about you, tourists galore, enticing street food and markets sellars, lots of beauty shops. love it !"
Lively,A great shopping area and plenty of restaurants. A nice walk pedestrians of shopping haven in Seoul. Must visit.
Crowded area where can find pretty much everything. ,"Area is huge. Alleys Cross to each other packed with clothes, food, jewellers etc. This place is kind of must to see f you haven't visit an any other Asia countries outdoor market. One thing catch my eyes, there is also quite many shops for photographers. If you find yourself in Seoul, visit there. It's kind of experience. "
Korean brand lovers heaven,"As an MCM avid fan, Seoul is a must visit, and it's flagship store in myeongdong comprised of 2 floors which will make a fan like me go crazy!As for all d popular skincare brands e.g. innisfree,face shop,saem,etude house n etc, u can find some good bargains for d sale items.All of d best thing here is? Lots of freebies to take home!"
Lots of ladies cosmetic shopping,"Some similar shops around all selling cosmetics and shoes. The night market have many interesting food. I love to get earrings there, they are super cheap and beautiful."
Cheap and good street food finds,Not too crowded til around 11am when most shops open. You just might miss the UNESCO engraving on the floor about 50 steps going to the church base stairs.Some of the oldest Korean restaurants can be located there.
Best place to taste Korean food,"There are numerous interesting shops and good restaurants. It is a wonderful place for you to try the local food and buy something special. Also, If you are a street photographer, you will find it worthy of a visit."
A very busy night market with massive crowds,"We came here during the evening after walking down from the Namsan Tower. The market becomes super lively during the evening with lots of food stalls (similar to those found in Taiwan). The Koreans love their weird and wacky food market items, You'll find something for everyone. If you get a chance - try the mini octopi and the dumplings!Here you will also find lots of 'discount' snack food shops. They are all basically priced the same along the street and all sell the same things. However we did notice later on some of the snacks were being sold at cheaper prices in just a regular supermarket so they might actually be tourist traps! Though - you really can't fault them for their variety!Lots of options for dinner in the area too if you want a sit down meal and also really close to the Lotte mall!"
Great street food,"Walked around Myeongdong every night because the carts with street food were excellent. It was great to explore the different foods. When we were tired of street food, there were a lot of restaurants to cater to our needs."
A must “do”,"Very close to the Myeongdong Cathedral there is this bunch of streets full of shops restaurants and street food stalls. This neighbourhood is beautiful and you may want to visit this few times while you are in town. The place is very crowded at every hour of the day and night. You will be surrounded by smells and flavours while walking along the main streets as well as noise and people from shops inviting you in. Street food is very cheap and typical Korean, l noticed quite a lot of difference between one stall or the other therefore pay attention to details when you pick one and eat there. Personally speaking l could not miss to stare at the frying oil as most of them have been frying stuff for the entire day and it is dark and smelly and unhealthy but that is everywhere and not only in Myeongdong after all. Perfect for shopping and great place to buy some little gifts from Seoul."
Should Visit!,Great place to try different Korean style street foods. Such a lively location with several sneaker and cosmetic stores. Have also tried a few nearby restaurants.
Myeongdong Streetfood,"Visited Myeongdong street food a few time during my family holiday in Seoul in Dec 2018. The street food is very delicious and also expensive. There are many varieties and among all my favourites are the sweet potatoes, grilled prawns with butter, grilled shredded cuttle fish and the fried potato chip. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best, their sneakers and sport attires are up to date. "
Lots to do ,Lots of food places are located on the street. There are many small shops as well as larger name brand stores together with department stores. Buy an ice cream or beef on a stick while you look around. 
A lot of nothing ,"I guess it is cool to see and visit this shopping street, but do not expect to actually find anything. There is a lot of nothing and actual stores that seems to be legit sells counterfeit goods for original prices, so be aware. "
Lots to aee,"Bustling, lots to see and buy. The street food is good and worth trying. You can snack along the way instead of dinner. There are plenty of shops: cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc, as well as plenty of outdoor stalls with gifts, clothes...."
The best,Shopping + food haven. You can literally find everything and anything here. We spent a good 2 days shopping and exploring the different restaurants and cafes. 
Shoppers paradise ,"This place is all about shopping fashion items clothes, shoes and of course korean beauty items. Street food is also every where. Just have cash handy atms and currency exchange is a bit of a walk from the street but still accessible. "
Endless Shopping and Street Food !!!,"We stayed in the heart of Myeongdong in Dec 18 and it was so convenient for shopping and trying different local food! We could actually run between different shops to compare prices, and return another day to make the actual purchase. Street food was fun to try as snacks for the first 2 days, but after that we had enough of them. Plenty of choices for proper sit down meals all around .. from BBQ, porridge, stews, etc ... just google the ""must try"" lists, read reviews and start work down from there."
"Market, cosmetics, street food","Great place if you like markets and cosmetics. It’s busy and crowded, tons of little shops (some there 2 and 3 times, like Lush and Innisfree). Mostly cosmetics, but also some good restaurants and great street food."
Amazing,Definitely a must visit! The FOOD ARE AMAZING! Shopping is great too! Their sport shoes and sneakers are cheaper compared to other asian countries :)
Shop 'til you drop!,Lots of shops for every taste and wallet. Nice street food at the end in the evenings. Highly recommend!
Shopppiiingggg!!!,"Well known area when it comes to korean beauty products. Hence, you will also find some apparel shops, mini mart, street food and restaurant, hotel and some souvenir items."
Shopping Mania,The absolute epitome of Asian Urban shopping. Many Korean products and crowded but colourful and energetic location.
Shopping Galore,"Can't think of what to give as a souvenier? Myeongdong is the place for you. It has everything - shoes, clothes, food, accessories, etc. Shop til you drop. Shopping haven especially for girls who likes Korean beuty products. If you go here make sure you bring plenty of cash. A must try also would be the street foods every night."
Must see in Seoul,"A vibrant, busy and tourist friendly area in Seoul. Easy to get to by the metro. Lots of eateries and shops. Multiple Starbucks in a small area :-) Lots of street food which is my favourite I must say. Very friendly people."
Suddenly I’m a shopaholic 😳,"I spent most of my time in Myeongdong shopping street. There are lots of eateries, it’s nice to have a quick bite and continue shopping. The ambience is nice especially at night when it gets busier, merrier and the street lights up beautifully. I recommend you all cosmetic lovers to shop at Baviphat cosmetic store as they sell cheap korean cosmetic products. It is an advantage for me since it is cheaper to buy my desired cosmetic products in Korea. Not only beauty care but also footwear and fashionable clothes. "
Bustling street packed with shops at street level....,"...though there are loads of other shops below street level (at the underground sections within Myeongdong station) and at the upper levels of each building. It’s easy to get distracted by the shopfront and promoters at street level who try to entice you with free samples to enter their premises. But learn to look up and check out the store signs where you will discover book stores, CD shops, non branded clothes shops, restaurants and even a meerkat cafe (yes, you heard me right....a cafe where there are real meerkats that come up close to you). The street resembles the hustle and bustle of streets in Asia except that you can feel a really young vibe here very much like Shinjuku in Tokyo. Loads of cosmetic brands (Tony Moly, Etude House, Innisfree....etc) each one trying to outsell each other by offering discounts or specials. Not surprising to see two outlets from the same brand just 100metres apart. This is also the place to get your K-pop merchandise fix where street carts and shops within Myeongdong station peddle all sorts of paraphernalia from key chains to posters to mugs sporting your favourite Korean pop idol. If you need to get stuff for family and friends (or even trendy clothes for your teen), this is the place to be with major shopping centres (Lotte, Shinsegae Department Stores). If you are in Korea during the winter/spring period, you will get to enjoy the Korean strawberries which are a real treat. Just don’t get them from the street carts along Myeongdong....You would probably get a better deal (almost half price) at Dongdaemun Market which is just a stop away on the Korean metro line."
An assault to the senses,Walking through Myeondong shopping street will not only whet your appetite for shopping but will also stimulate all your senses. There’s so much going on! There are shops everywhere and also vendors in the streets. It can be easily an overwhelming place but can also be a fun place to visit.
Haven for Street Food & Shopping,"We simply can’t get enough of exploring Meyongdong shopping street (Go in the night time). There are far too many options to choose, from tons of restaurants, street food vendors and hundreds of shops selling all kinds of things. Apparently this is where most people shop for skin care products as well.Though I must say that this is a HIGHLY touristy place thus the prices are more on the higher side. That said, you have to check out the buzz this area creates in the evenings. It’s bustling with people from all parts of the world. A really cool place to hang out with kids. You can never have enough food here ! Try the Oreo Churros, Grilled Lobster, Baked cheese, sweet corn, Skewered Potatoes, Beef, baked scallops, etc. yummy !!! It’s quite a gastronomic experience.Typical street food snacks cost upwards of US$5 (5000 KWR). Happy eating & exploring ! "
Haven of beauty products!,"If you’re into cosmetics and beauty products, you have to go to this place and you won’t probably finish the whole area in just one night. Too many shops offering different prices of the same product. Sellers offering freebies for you to enter their shops. You can find good deals when shops are on sale but that means you really have to spend time going into each store. So far the most common stores I saw in literally every street are, aritaum, skinfood, artbox, too cool for school, innisfree, clio, nature republic, banila co., and tony molly. I’m sure I miss a lot but really with that many cosmetic shops, I’m lucky I can still remember a few! There are also good street food but not a lot. Myeongdong is very accessible, there’s an MRT that goes straight into the market. If you know how to find your way through Seoul’s MRT then it’s really easy to find places in Seoul. I’m so used to taking MRT here in Taiwan so Seoul was no problem for me.I would recommend anyone visiting Seoul to visit Myeongdong just to experience the cosmetic culture of Korea."
All in one to shop,"Never get bored to visit multiple times Good to try street foods, not really reasonable price...wandering as many shops as possible before you make purchases. Different prices at different shops..."
Lots of street foods + Cosmetic,"We stayed 5 nights at Metro Hotel Myeongdong. The best place if we go for eat and shopping with teenagers. There are many streetfoods around the streets every 4pm until night. We just walked 5min from hotel to find the streetfoods and so many cosmetic store in myeongdong. Ettude, Innisfree, Faceshop, Tonimolly, Olive Young, etc. Odeng = Fish Cake = 2000 won, Pork Barbeque = 6000 won, Tornado potato = 3 or 4000 wonWe also ate Korean fried chicken such as BHC = 18000 won for 1 package = 9 drumsticks. Myeongdong has 2 sunway : Euljiro 1 ( Green Line 2 ) and Myeongdong ( Light Blue Line 4 ). Our hotel is near Euljiro 1 Exit 5 or 6 ( only 2min )."
Street food ,"I went 2 times , i love the street and it was good experience to see the street food and I tried . Also there was allot of makeup shops everywhere."
A truly shopper's haven,"The whole area is just a shopper's pure delight and haven! Everywhere you turn, every nook and corner, every building you enter, every lane you go to, it's nothing but shops, shops and more shops... the place never sleep, I think.....it's literally ""shop till you drop"".... "
Shopping Haven for the Ladies!!!!,"This place has got to be ladies’ favourite place of whole Seoul. You can find lots of beauty products here. I personally LOVE Olive Young store where you can find numerous products for skincare and cosmetics. I basically went into every shops in Myeongdong. The street vendors selling street foods are the best. Do try the fishcake with soup, Hotteok, fried squids, Jeok (savoury pancake). But in winter it can be a little difficult to shop. But that did not stop me from dropping by there every day. Will definitely go there again.P/s: for the ladies who want to buy beauty products, pls do your homework and plan what you want to buy. Because everything in Korean and you must know what you want to buy."
So so outting,I had heard a lot about the shopping here but i was not very satisfied with the experience. It was crowded and your pace will be dictated by the oldest and slowest in the crowds. The merchandise on sale mostly appeated to be generic knock-offs and no-name fabrics. The bargaining was half-hearted at best. The other less popular markets and shopping streets are better so i'd skip this one if you are on a limited timetable or looking for something specific. 
Hectic place but worth a visit,"Crazy place to go shopping as people try to drag you into every store, but worth the experience and you can definitely get some good bargains while you're there!"
Shopping on weekends for great discounts!,"There are many people everyday at Myeongdong Shopping street but on weekends, people flock the shopping area for freebies and discounts. I bought so many buy 1 take 1 masks ad make up on a Saturday! The street has full of activities - shopping, street food eating and light show (Christmas season). It may really get cold during winter however... A must see when in Seoul!"
Pushy sales and exorbitant prices street food,"Myeongdong is known to be cosmetic haven for tourists with most beauty brands having a shop presence and good discounts. Even MCM has a two-storey flagship store there and you can also buy all sorts of snacks/ tidbits from the Korean marts to bring home. 200% in terms of convenience. However, be forewarned. Sales people in the cosmetic shops are very very pushy, not only do they follow you ard, they also try to upsell at every opportunity. In addition, the street food carts do not have displayed prices (I only found out later that this is not the norm after visiting areas like Gangnam & Hongdae where prices are clearly displayed). I am not sure if I was “cheated”, I was charged 5,000 won for a stick of fish cake where it is sold at 2,000 won max at other areas. You are better off eating in the many small eateries/ restaurants in the area."
Very busy street,"Myeongdong comes alive from 4pm to 10pm with the various food and clothing stalls. It’s worth a visit. You get to see all sorts of food items being sold as well as clothes, toys, shoes, etc."
Fantastic value for money,"We all went crazy... great selections, low prices. Cannot really bargain much though. 90 percent female fashion and accessories. Long padded jackets going fr 40K won or less..."
A lot of tourists here,"Stayed away from this place if you don’t like shopping or seeing/being in the sea of people. This is the makeup shopping mecca for tourists visiting South Korea. This shopping street reminded me of shopping malls on Black Friday. There are deals everywhere and ones can get easily overwhelmed. Even when you come in with a specific items to purchase at the makeup store, the sales people will keep trying to persuade you to spend more money at the store by selling bulk items at cheaper price. Sales people will walk with you closely as you browse at the store and it can be an uncomfortable experience. There are plenty of food vendors on the street as well. If you’re health conscious, I can tell you that you won’t find any healthy options because all the offerings are similar to county fair food types. Come here at least once to get the experience."
this street is same manhattan's 5 ave in seoul city,"We got off namsan tower and went to myungdong. the weather was very cold. We came here for decades, wanted to have warm meal. but we could not find a restaurant. we finally met the staff who showed we the place and fund the restaurant location. there was a restaurant in the nearby alley. we warmed body because we ate warm sullung-tang. myung-dong is still the center of seoul."
Shops of Top Brands and a lot of eating options,"A shoppers paradise, one can find every top local and Premium international brands here. The market starts from Myeongdong Subway station and ends at Lotte Department Store. Myeongdong shopping street also boosts of many restaurants serving Western, Japanese cuisine in addition to Korea. And there are carts serving local delicacies."
Family tour in Korea,Myeongdong Shopping Street is a nice place where you can find trendy goods. We bought some pairs of shoes which my daughter only found here. Also the street foods is a nice experience since they offer delicious and tasty food but be careful they are not cheap!!!You might over indulge in here!!! 
A fun place,"The street is lined is lined by food stalls. There are also stalls selling clothes, bags and souvenirs. The mood is electric and although crowded, it is a fun place to pass an evening."
Crowded but fun!,"A lot of people on the street to try the food and buy cheap apparel. Lots of cosmetic shops, restaurant and malls."
Best place for shopping and street food ,Don’t go to this place if you’re in a budget cause there are so many delicious food that you need to try and so many shops!!
Didn't care about the shopping... came here for the food and was not disappointed!,"While there are plenty of places to shop up and down the street, I came here for the food, and I was not disappointed! Even on a cold night (-10C), there were plenty of people lining the streets trying out all the street food vendors. I did a walk to scout out the place first and selected a few places here and there to try out, and wasn't disappointed in any of them. They even had an Oreo Churro cart that I skipped out on, but the hot food really hit the spot on a cold night. Don't know much Korean but was able to communicate with finger pointing and numbers in English (or calculators), which got the job done. Would definitely come back to this place, maybe next time not in the winter though. =D"
Busy byt fun,"This group of streets offers so much to do, see and eat!! There are so many shops, both big global shops like Zara and Nike. However, there are cool street vendors too. The streets are also packed with beauty stores, filled with make up products and all the latest skincare things too.The street food, that opens from around 2pm is also FANTASTIC!!! You can get lobster tails - strawberries on a stick. Crepes to fried noodles or a kebab. They have it all!!Be prepared for the CROWDS though!! It's always pscked!!! "
An amazing place for shopping but pricey,"This is a shopping haven for sure for those who love shopping! I may not just have explored the entire place but the stores closed earlier than I expected (around 10pm). I thought they would be open as late as 2am or so. So keep that in mind if you planned on shopping pretty late at night!I also noticed the prices are a bit expensive here - that's why it was called one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world! So definitely check the other areas in Seoul if you plan to do a lot of shopping because other places like Dongdaemun, Ehwa and Hongdae were a little cheaper!"
Samples galore and great street food!,Make sure to wear comfortable shoes if you head to Myeongdong. Tip: many of the beauty stores tend to give out face masks for simply browsing in the stores.
"Crowded plsce, but a lot to buy","Myeongdong shopping street is nice for buying cosmetics, but I would not recommend going here during the weekends. It's very crowded. The street food here is also very nice. "
a paradise for cosmetic and food enthusiasts,"You will love when you first visit here, cosmetics, clothing and food are spread out in every corner like an area that is partying, there is always a reason to remember this place"
Spend pennies or pounds!,"Many, many boutique shops for everyone. I particularly recommend the traditional caligraphy brush shop, the bag shop with unbelievably low prices, the jade jewellery shop, and the sugar sweets demonstration that you'll never forget, along with the taste that you'll savour forever!"
Population Explosion,"Visiting Myeongdong Shopping Street in December is a nightmare, as it is heavily visited both by locals and tourists. It is difficult to really take in the sights and enjoy the experience, and you have to do the best you can.It does seem like a fabulous Street though and would not discourage anybody from visiting. Just be smart about it.The Street Food is good and a good variety. Worth visiting for just the street food. But there is plenty of shopping and bargain hunting to be done.My favorite was the Uniqlo Store and the Lotte Dept Store close by. Almost a full day allocation."
One of my favorite places in Seoul,Myeongdong is one of my favorite places in Seoul! I love all the stores and the street food is amazing. If you’re looking for Korean Skincare this is the place to be! Missha is my favorite! 
A must! ,Amazing world full of small wendors who are offering great street food. Get lost inside this beautiful place and try all the food! 
Myeongdong is a shopping district,"I always stay at Myeongdong when in Korea, i love shopping, I love make ups , face, body and hair care name it!"
Just keep going there to shop for face masks etc,"The land of face masks is best experienced here where you can go to so many different stores to get hundreds if not thousands of dollars of face masks and when you buy that much, dont forget to ask the free cabin bags to take all of your masks home. "
Best street food in town ,For a first time visitor to South Korea this is a must. We enjoyed the smells and flavours. It’s true immersion in the local cuisine and culture and very affordable. just a few minutes from city hall station. Don’t miss out 
"Fantastic street food, but beauty stores here feel pressured ","Loved this area, buzzing at night Street food was lovely, ranging from $5 upwards for a portion,The beauty stores here make you feel pressured to buy, staff walk around with you like they are stalking you, they keep going on about buying this and that, and buying in bulk like spending $60 for face masks! I hated shopping here, much preferred Gangnam area , same shops but calmer and easier to buy."
A Visit in MyeongDong Shopping Street,"This is a must visit for all visitors and tourists in Seoul. Honestly I don't understand why many people visited this place for products, food and souvenirs. Despite there are many street foods areas in MyeongDong, please be sure that they are all selling the same types of Korean foods. That's why I am confused what is the attractions in MyeongDong."
Big Shopping Market,I don’t need to write very long story for this place because anybody knows this famous shopping market. If you want to eat and shop till drop this place is the best. Some store open until 11 pm even midnight. But you have to selective because too many store there. My fave store is Lala Mart. iIt looks like a mini market with yellow sign but they have many various things that you might wanna buy and cheaper than other store. You can buy various snacks or anything for souvenirs.
Annual couple trip,A heaven for ladies to shop! Wide range of beauty products and clothing for ladies and men. This is a shopping heaven!
Overpriced,"Why would you shop in Korea? Sure you can get Korean cosmetics, but everything else is way over priced because of the taxes. It's a known fact."
K-Beauty lovers’ dream,All the Korean beauty names (or at least a few) like TonyMoly - Laneige - Etude House - the SAEM - Innisfree - Missha - and plenty more! 
Busy area,"I heard from some of my local friends that the prices here is actually pretty higher than other places. It’s always full of people and tourists whether you visited it at day or night, weekdays or weekends. "
Nothing but shopping,A lot of stalls selling different types of things... Usually your partner will spent a few mins in every stores....leaving you outside waiting for her or you can join her....A lot of variety to choose..
Must visit place in Seoul,"Any traveller coming here for the 1st time should visit this place and spend money, that's my kindly advice, you could buy premium cosmetics with acceptable price!"
Enjoy street food!,Very very crowded street. Lots of shops for skin care products and clothing. All kinds of street food available if you are a non-vegetarian. One can easily spend 3/4 hours shopping and enjoying the street food.
Quite Localised experience,We went there for street food and local items. Very good and reasonably priced. Never go to that Lotte Duty Free mall as it is a nightmare and expensive quoted in USD only. But street market is ideal to visit for all classes
Great food. Cheap buys. ,"I recommend some of you to check out the store beside the DeliManjoo. It’s inside the Myeongdong station and offered the cheapest snacks so far (01/03/2019). And try DeliManjoo while you’re at it too! Or maybe if you want bigger and more choices, King Mart will do. I don’t recommend buying at the other places because they were expensive, as per the comparisons we made. We almost went to every shop we can (because it’s cold, and we need to warm up. Kidding.) and you’ll be very surprised to find yourself buying things cheaper as compared to buying it in your country. In our case, it was JPY:KRW which is 1:10.The food was awesome, by the way. The snail was kinda hard to chew, in my opinion though. Some of ‘em don’t know how to speak English though but patience is a virtue. Anyway, I recommend you to ask for the price first before eating "
One of the biggest shopping area but not for Man.,This is crazy..whole street is packed of fashion and skincare shops. U can get any korean brand here. Very crowded. A lot street food but korean doesnt sell cheap street food like other countries have.
Good for shopping & small eats on streets ,"I think good place to shop for Korea cosmetics & eat street foods. Must eat the mochi red bean strawberries, chicken skewers, grilled scallops & baked cheese lobsters, grilled beef steak, etc"
Myeondong Street,"Heaven for the ladies! Street shopping, you can get everything you need here. For skin products enthusiast this street is a must, and your partners can enjoy the foodstreet."
heaven on earth,myeongdong shopping street is truly heaven on earth for people who love shopping. spent the whole day here and still want more!!
Hight street shopping with street food to explore,"Plenty of retail stores to shop for youngsters, local and international brands too. Cosmetics galore and there is a chain store (Olive Young) that house major and smaller brands.Cafes everywhere too."
Cosmetic Shopping Magic with street food!,"I would list in my must-go place. The area has lots of cosmetic shops, clothings, discount food marts and plenty of street food. I came here a tad early at 12 plus in the afternoon. Most of the street vendors hadn’t set up their stalls. The advantage was that a much smaller crowd in popular shops such as the Line Bear; where there’s a giant one-half storey tall bear available for free photo taking. This area also has cat cafe and a good selection of restaurants, coffee cafes. By 4pm, the area was filled with people and most of the streets stall are out in full force. The atmosphere is very different from Hongik University street which is also worthy of a visit! "
Fashion in a budget,"Myeongdong shopping street is a vibrant place where this is a shopping haven for shopaholics. The place is lined with korean clothes and accessories from bags, socks, and souvenirs. Myeongdong is also famous for street foods. Cost is budget friendly in this location. The myeongdong church is also near at this place. It is in the middle seoul that can be access with a taxi or train."
Shopping heaven with yummy streetfood,"You can find anything here, from Korean cosmetics to international clothing chains. But what makes it so fun and special, are all the streetfood stalls that crowd the streets from 3 Pm onwards. Bacon wrapped veggies, fishcakes, shrimpshrewers and chocolate dipped strawberries. It does get crowded so we had to watch our 6&4 yo closely. "
Must see in Seoul ,"This whole street is a taste of what Seoul really is. Full of cosmetics shops and street food, it was one of my favorites during my visit. You really feel in Korea! "
Happy place !!!,This place is the heart of Seoul for us. Shops closes late till 10 pm so after our land tour we can still shop and eat street foods which Myeongdong offers a lot. That’s why I always choose hotel right here in Myeongdong. 
Good shopping areas ,Many varieties of retail outlets and and good food outlets after a tiring shopping. The retail assistant gives good service too. 
good shopping area,the items like the clothes are very nice and a lot of sale. would love to come back again and shop more items
Great atmosphere,"Tonnes of shops for indoor shopping and sales ongoing. Also what makes the place buzzing are the rows of stalls outside selling street food, clothing, etc. "
Must go,Great place to shop and for dining. There are plenty shops for any products. Try the street food stalls. It’s always crowded though. 
Vibrant night life ,"The area was rife with shopping and food and ranged from household names such as Daiso to a huge North Face store. There were sports shops at nearly every turn eg JD sports, Adidas, Nike etc to small stores that sold SGD 1 pair of socks. There are arty stationery shops, massage and nail spas, confectionery stores and lots of shops selling face products from oatmeal face masks to brightening face masks. What was fascinating was the vibrant night life. The area came to life at night with food stores selling butter garlic scallops, beef balls, twisted potato chips, fried pancakes and waffles etc. The list and selection of foods boggled the mind. You just could not eat enough and there was so much interesting foods to try and sample. It was admittedly a little steep in price but it really depended on whether you ordered a chicken fried corn sausage or a buttered lobster. Really worth a visit. "
Great shopping experience!,"Lots of reasonably priced tax-free merchandise (maybe because we went during the holidays) in a wide variety. Street food abounds, too! Must experience!"
Shopping paradise & street food,"This is a great place for Korean beauty products, clothes, sports wear and accessories. The road traders will setup their stalls around late afternoon till 11pm. Lots of street food, it is a must try when in Seoul. All the food are simply delicious. It’s pretty busy here but a few of the roads are closed off to vehicles from 10am to 11pm, so if u have young children just be mindful else the place is pretty safe and tourist friendly. The traders can communicate in simple English and i was kinda surprise that many of them speaks mandarin too. Love this place and look forward to our next visit."
Packed like sardines,"If its cosmetics, clothing and shoes that one is looking for, look no further. We were here on Christmas day and the narrow streets were literally shoulder-to-shoulder walking space. Not enough space to stretch out your hands let alone swing a cat!Cosmetics are cheap (So says my wife). Its worth a walk thru and there are lots of street food vendors around. "
Great atmosphere but crowded! ,"If you enjoy a crowded street market type atmosphere with lots to see, hear and taste, then you should enjoy this area. Lots of stores and stalls, the area is a bit of a maze that you can wander around. Stall prices are ok but not the best (example, Dongdaemon’s Migliore have generally better pricing). Easily accessible by Myeongdong Station. "
Shopping Paradise for Cosmetic Lovers,"If you would like to pick up different type of cosmetic products, this is one stop for all. Do note that the push cart on the streets are retailing more expensive than the underground stalls. You can also pick up a map so that its easy to move around. Can spend easily half a day here. "
All about k-beauty here! ,"Must visit if you love Korean skincare products. They are selling it so much cheaper here, I especially love their facial masks. Less than half the price compared my home country. Good brands such as Laneige, AHC, Iope, Sulwashoo and many many more. Definitely will be back here if I am visiting Seoul again."
Fantastic experience for food and shopping!,"Really enjoyed our visit here and fantastic if you are into shopping. Also so many street vendors so go hungry! A great experience, would recommend. "
Eat and shop till drop ,This is the best place on earth which you can eat and shop from morning till night. This is mainly for tourists so the price are slightly higher. But they have everything you need there. 1 stop place if you only have 1 day in Seoul.
Great area to stay!,We stayed at The Grand Hotel Myeongdong and loved the festive atmosphere right outside the hotel. The shopping and street food were amazing!
Crowded place.,Crowded place. You must know what you want to get from here and stay focus on your objective. A lot of small lane have similar shops. Always ask for sample if you are buying cosmetic items. A lot of street food but too crowded to stay around and eat.
A great shopping street to visit... even if you buy nothing,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street, and all the associated side streets and lane-ways, is a great way to spend at LEAST a couple of hours just walking around this primarily pedestrian shopping area. There is so much to see, well-know (and not so well-known) shops to browse, and a plethora of restaurants, and street food vendors. I just love to sample street food wherever I visit, and I just loved being able to sample some of the very tasty and generally inexpensive street food that was on offer in this shopping precinct.While it is referred to as a shopping street (implying that it is a single street..) it is actually an entire area of primarily pedestrian streets that all seem to ""hang off"" what is generally accepted as the main ""shopping street"".A visit to Seoul is definitely not complete unless you have spent at least a couple of hours wandering around this area. Fortunately for my partner and I, our hotel was only about 10-12 minutes walk away, and so we passed through this area on a number of occasions, and enjoyed the experience every time... daytime OR night-time. Thoroughly recommended."
A must visit for food and shopping ,"Stayed near Myeongdong due to food street and underground/street shopping.A must visit place for tourist and it’s so crowded due to Xmas/festive season.Plenty of money changers around so in case you need to TOP up more Korean wons. Lots of cosmetics, shoes and snacks to buy!Line friend and Kakao are there too"
Awesome and Cheap Buys !,Alot of cosmetic products are avaliable at affordable prices here ! not to mention the numerous dining options avaliable. A great place to visit if you want to buy everything under one roof.
Shopping and eating !!!,"When come to korea, you won’t miss this place especially with teenagers. % tourist place and you have lots of shops for bargain and street food was lining up at night to sell all kinds local street food. Very crowded and you can imagine the night is packed with local and tourist especially at night. Many tourist guides standing around to provide you direction and hence very convenient to walk around . "
Love it! ,A must visit if you come to Seoul. Abundance of street food & also Korean skincare products. I was in heaven! 
Night Market market ,"I love the place. Crowded and busy but beautiful. I love all the bargain products. Easy to talk to the staffs. I also love the street foods and especially the dessert, icecream! We love going during night time."
Very famous and must visit by a tourist,"When I was in Seoul for the business visit, I checked with the local people about places to visit for the shopping, this name was taken by every one. Yes, the place deserve. If you are having sufficient time and you want to enjoy the shopping specially clothes, shoes and anything, you will enjoy this place. Thanks"
Great shopping area,"Great place to shop during winter. Many choices for teenagers on clothing and make up and skin care.At night many street food line up for hungry shopper. But there is lack of toilet nearby for shoppers to use. Also some skincare shop pressured you to buy, i find it annoying."
Very interesting and no wonder it is an Unesco site!,"Almost every well known Korean brand can be found here and Main Street branches into side streets. Lots of F&B outlets - from cafes to restaurants to tea house ...At night, the street is lined with Hawkers selling local snacks like Potato tornado, dumplings, cheese and rice cake on stick, fried chicken, maize, strawberries, bbq seafood etc .... Really safe environment with a police station right in the centre of this area. Clothing, accessories and skincare are easily available. Sports shops like ABC Mart etc"
Interesting place,"Many food stall along the way. Recomended food and lots of variations too. Do please try the egg bread, pork bbq satay, japchae, strawberry coated with mochi, bungeopang, and many more. You could find souveniers too here. They also sell socks, t shirts, and cosmetics. Recomended night market. "
Stock up on K Beauty products here,"Worth a visit for the street food and shopping options. There's a huge Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and MCM store, along with multiple branches of k beauty stores, offering discounts and duty free shopping. "
More Hype Than I Expected,"Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me. During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier. I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heck,....I am a guy. I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there. You don't like the price, goes elsewhere. Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey. Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15,000 won which is between $13 to $15 US. But what the heck is cheese on it for???? I would rather have had butter!"
"Cosmetics, street food, nite market","U can find almost everything here, halal food is also available at this street. Stay near by this street walking distance, stayed at Skypark Central Hotel. We visit this street every nite for food and on my last day I shop for cosmetic and shoes. "
"Lots of night life, food and buzz ",It’s a tourist destination. Lots of street vendors. Food and stuff. Mainly tourists but a good place to soak in the culture and atmosphere. We sent the kids to the arcade while the adults shopped. Arcade’s great. Payable by the hour with some free games for young children. Lots of virtual reality stuff. 
wonderful strolling,I love this shopping district in Seoul where all items you want are available from high end items to mid range goods and products and street foods. Stay at this area for your unlimited exploration of this area. I love Myeongdong very much because of the many coffee shops here and restaurants offering Korean food and other international cuisines. This is a must see when you are in Seoul. Stay at Ibis Hotel Myeongdong because it is very near the area.
Nice shipping street but BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS ,Nice shopping street and eateries. Beware of PICKPOCKETS. Wife was targeted. Swift and fast when the culprit/s would blend in the crowds. Have all your pockets tightly buttoned. My friend was a victim too last year. 
Combi of Shopping and line delicous streetfoods,"This place amazed for how the crowd can have enough of everything from shopping to enjoying the sumptous streetfood. There a line of street food vendors in every corner of the street selling japchae,ttbeokki , stir fried chicken, galbi, pancakes, seafood skewers, egg muffin and a lot more.We keep ong visiting every night for the duration of our stay to make sure we tried most of it but our time wasn't enough."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Before my trip to Myeongdong, I read that it is like the Orchard Road of Singapore. I was there the week before last and found it to be more like Bugis instead. It was not a good time to visit South Korea at this time of the year. The biting cold made street shopping unbearable and undesirable. Anyway, the shops are repetitive and the street food pricey. And although there are many cafes, the quality and vibes did not meet my expectation. The people there are also generally less pleasant.Twosome Place seems to be the local version of Starbucks. Huge place with nice and cozy seating areas but the cakes are not the same as those from Starbucks. The Paris Baguette in South Korea isn’t quite the same as the one here. I had intended to have my daily breakfast at Paris Baguette but ended up spending every morning at Tous les Jours instead. The latter offers a variety of interesting and palatable bread and pastries. A little more pricey though - a bun and a cuppa sets you back about S$8/9.Do make a point to eat their Ginseng Chicken stuffed with rice in chicken broth. I had it at the first and original restaurant near City Hall Station Exit 10.As for the touted Korean Fried Chicken or Chimaek, I tried Kyochon (Sinchon) and Twotwo Chicken (Myeongdong). I must say I prefer Kyochon. It was good and slightly less pricey than Twotwo. The chicken are fresher too. For ladies, it’s probably a haven for all sorts of mostly low to mid range beauty and skin care products. I feel that Myeongdong is a little overhyped but if you enjoy the vibes of bright lights, and the sound and sight of being in the crowd then you’d probably like this place. As for me, just once is sufficient. If you have been to Japan, then you might want to manage your expectation a little just so that you will be able to see Korea in a more positive light. What surprised me was that, other than beauty products and clothings, things and especialy food, including street food, generally cost more than those in Japan. "
Bustling streets !,Lots of shopping and Food streets with many stalls. lots of tourists and locals. Can find almost everything there. Open till 10+ and absolutely loved if 
Wow! just wow!,"I spent so much money there .. the street food in the evening was amazing and the shops came alive at night, it was like two different places during the day it's a normal town .. a fair few people going about their day. . And night/evening it becomes a hustle and bustling place with thousands descending on the streets, it was amazing to be there while the Christmas lights were lit. Truely is a have to be there to understand the two different faces of seoul. Without a doubt I'm going back very soon"
Great,"Years has past since my last visit in 2014 & before that but Myeongdong still remain a great attraction, great shopping street & a local food street at nite, full of tourists full of noise full of ambience...Like best still the food stalls at nite, u will definitely find something nice. Tried quite a few - Korean fish cake, grill prawn, fruit juice, chestnut, Gimbap etc lots of varieties. It's freezing in Dec so the food stalls really warm up your tummy!Great to stay near Myeongdong, so convenient to subway, airport shuttle bus stop, bakery for breakfast, restaurants, departmemt store (run out of time to revisit) ....& Rolling Pin, found this nice bakery near to exit 5 or 6 of Euljiro 1 station on way to hotel, it's quietly at a corner. We had our breakfast there every morning after we found it, the bread is so nice, great coffee & ambience! If u have limited time in Seoul & want to experience nite shopping street with local food stalls, Myeongdong is the place!"
Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul,"This place appears to be a “must visit”. There are many stores here selling clothing, etc. There are also many eateries and street food in the evening. The place is so vibrant and crowded with both locals and tourists. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul. "
Butter prawns!!,"Had the absolute best buttered prawns here. Don't be fooled by the street market appearance. Some of the food sold by the stalls here can even qualify for a Michelin star! So much variety from seafood, to pancakes, to traditional Korean food. Lots of cheap, imitation clothes too."
Tranforms in evening,"I would recommend visiting this street towards the evening when the streets get closed to vehicular traffic and instead get lined up with apparel, accessories, souvenir shops and food stalls serving myriad Korean dishes from seafood to sugary savoury delights.For those of you who want to haggle on prices, good luck with that since the shopkeepers here have a union of sorts where they don't charge any less than the price marked. To that end, the prices here are already very competitive and hence bargaining isn't really needed. For those of you who would still love to bargain, should head to the nearby Myeong-dong Underground Shopping center where the shopkeepers are more willing for some bargaining.Expert Tip: For beating harsh Seoul winter weather, going Underground will be a much more comfortable stroll in the endless matrix of alleys."
Vacation ,"This is a must visit place in Korea. There are lots of choices of cosmetics for you to choose from. But too many tourists means lack of attention from the staff and they can be rude at times. It is a also a good place to shop for sports shoes. The prices are better than back home in Singapore.There is a variety of street food if you get hungry after shopping. I won’t recommend you to cab home as we realized that the taxis don’t go by meter in the night. Best is to travel by train, cheap and easy. "
"Love, love, love the Sights and Sounds of Myeongdong Shopping Street","Our hotel was just at the end of the Myeongdong shopping street, which was PERFECT for a nightly stroll through all the stalls and snacking. Every night we selected our favorite delicious Korean treats for a late-night snack. Favorite Snacks:* Korean pancake with honey and cinnamon inside..mmmm...* Kimchee dumplings* Lobster (Pricey at USD$15, but so worth it!)* Shrimp and butter....yum* Egg on bread (bread was more like cornbread. simple snack)* Spiral potatoesIf you like congee, you've got to try the Congee House at the end of the street (31 Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Chungmuro 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul,) The abalone congee is to die for! We ordered the ""take out"" and it was packaged so well."
"Shopping, eating street foods.","If you wanna try Korean style street foods, visit here.Clean and interesting.Also, bunch of fast fashion brands is here."
Shopping heaven,"You can get everything here. Food, souvenir, beauty product even friends. It's a must go places you should go when you visit Seoul. Try the street food. Some are quite expensive but it's a once in a lifetime try."
Ultimate Shopping Street,"MSS has got everything you need covered, from cosmetics to street food. The vibe during the day and night are definitely different. I spent the whole day here and still haven't finished shopping (haha). The guides wearing red are located at the entrance of the shopping street so do sought out their help. Sock shopping is best done in Myeongdong. In my experience, exchange rate is highest in Myeongdong, particularly the one inside Migliore."
Let go your money....Shopping and eating,"I stay at Moons Hostel, 8 minutes to Myeongdong shopping area. here you can eat halal food at the street and restaurant named Busan and kampungku (Malaysian Rest). Beauty products everywhere cheap and many mask gifts if you buy. And also socks with many designs with 1000won. If you can't find places you can ask Tourist person there. At Ishadong sell key chain, magnet and handmade bags inside and outside the building. Please buy wood spoons and others made from original wood and beautiful. At Namdaemon market sell brooch, shirts with comfortable price but I think closed 5.30. Please book on line to Nami Island and Everland, it's cheap. Beautiful area for family and couple."
Shopping Street,"If you are looking to spend your hearts out, come to myeondong street to shop. Big brands boutiques on sales which can go as low as 70%."
" Boon for women, but possibly a bane for the less metrosexual men","Huge shopping area with shops selling beauty products and fashion stuff. Generally beauty products are cheaper than back home. Also a wide variety of local Korean products that women (and some men) just love to get their hands on. Be prepared for lots of walking with little chances for sitting unless u are having a meal in one of those many restaurants dotted around the place.There's also many street food stall, but mind you, they are franchised, so much repetition.Access to the place mainly via Myeongdong station. Close proximity to Shinsaegae Departmental Store and Lotte Departmental Store."
SHOPPING!!!!,Love love love Myeongdong. You can go crazy shopping here haha so much good food and cosmetics!! Must try: - Aori Ramen- Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong - BHC Chicken Must go: - SPAO - All the cosmetic shops (hahaha)
The youth vibe is strong here :),"Just walking around is fun. Of course, shopping and eating makes it even more fun!I like Myung In Mandoo, because I can sit down to eat in peace at street food prices."
Anything you want.,"Cosmetics valley.Foods be it street foods, restaurants or just a cafe's. Looking for Korean Seaweed, they have KMart."
Vacation in Seoul,"The place is great for shopping. Big discounts are offered by various merchants. Street foods are delicious, but a little bit expensive. If it is your first time to Myeongdong, make sure that you bring a map with you. Same business establishments appear in different streets. There is no public toilet with in the area. You have to enter in a coffee shop or dine just to use their toilet. Definitely this will cost you."
Amazing food. Cosmetic shopping. Restaurants,"Walking along Myeong-dong Street, the first thing we would notice is the food stalls selling mouthwatering street food. We went there on a weekend and there were lots of people. But, as a family with kids (we were even using a stroller), we were able to maneuver easily. We tried almost all the food they sold. And they all tasted good! Just for you to have an ideo of how much the food are, here are the food prices i remember: takoyaki with baby octopus is 5,000 won, vegetable omelette is 3,000 won, lobster with cheese is 15,000 won, and their soft serve ice cream is 2,000 won . Most food are priced at 3,000 won to 6,000 won each. The lobster is expectedly expensive. There are cosmetic shops at the side of the street. Some of them give free face masks to entice you to check out their shop and buy from them. There are also stalls selling coats, souvenirs, socks, gloves, etc. "
Exciting and Fascinating,A Seoul must-do! So many street vendors selling clothes and food. Surrounded by several shops and cafes. So much yummy stuff you'll want to try so go with an empty stomach! it gets very busy. Also amazing at night time when it is covered in light
visit once,"the first time was great, all the food seemed tantalizing and yummy, shops all around abound with goods, as well as the ubiquitous korean beauty products.the second time, we explored more of the alleyways connected with the main shopping row, thinking we might discover something new, did not happen. food stalls sell basically more of the same: hotdog with batter, fish cake, skewers, cheese lobster, fruit juices, milk tea, crepe, twisted potato, strawberry chocolates, egg bread, and cheese clam.even the stores are repetitive: ABC Mart, Innisfree, Oliver Young, Lesmore... it got stale and boring pretty fast.there are a few gems like Mother's Touch which sells mainly fried chicken and maaan so goooood. they're located on the 5th floor of a secluded building which you will miss if you stick to the middle of the road.basically it's one big tourist trap. visit it once just so you can say you've visited. come back if you forgot something, other than that, it's an expensive and crowded place."
All Global Stores and shoppers paradise ,Myeongdong Shopping street is very easily accessible from City Hall as well as my train. There are several subway entrances to the main street. The Subway is well marked in English.Besides the usual shopping some of my recommendations are as under: 1. Visit this Street during the weekends - it's phenomenal 2. Don't just check out the shops at the ground level but also look out for good restaurants and shops on Level 1 & 23. Sample all the street food available on the street especially the local bun and egg baked and the prawns cooked in tempura.4. They have a huge contact lens market with plethora of color options.Hint: jus go empty handed as you can really shop a lot.
Bursting Modern Korean Culture from Souvenirs to foods!,"Myeong to the Dong! Wow! The single word that could describe this place - wow. From the signage on the road which marks the entrance of the shopping area I was already trapped in its ambiance. I've read and watched a lot of blogs and vlogs about Myeongdong before coming to Korea. So seeing it in actual is really something. Street foods lined both sides of the road along with different stalls of souvenir items, shoes, socks, chestnuts and all sort of things. Shopping buildings and restaurants are also everywhere. It seems like a never ending stretch because it extends horizontally and vertically. I really loved shopping for souvenirs there because its cheap! Also the selection of food is really nice from hotteok to gyeranpang to odeng. Along with friend chicken with tteok etc.It's truly a heaven for foodies and shoppers. Great place to visit!"
Very crowded and things are more expensive,"Very crowded during day or night. Many store selling cosmetics and beauty products. Street foods are more expensive compare to Hongdae, dongdaemun and namdaemun. Overall a very good experience to spend sometime here."
Tour trip,Quite a huge shopping street. Just grab anything you like because the street vendors are just selling the same thing. Only extra precaution as street is super crowded
Great Place for street food and shopping,"This is a very famous shopping street, great varieties of street food, mouth watering food, shops for great shopping experience"
Street of shopping & eating ,"I heard a lot about Myeongdong before my trip, not knowing what to expect until I visied the place for the first time. Lots of shops, especially skin care products. The pricing is cheaper than my country. Must buy facial masks, very cheap. This place turns alive in the evening when the people pushes out the street cart and it becomes food street. Tasted a few, not bad but not fantastic. Good for experience but I won't eat again. It is a tourist place."
Good shopping spot for Korean skin care and novelties,"Korea is known for their sheet masks and skin care products, that are part of the famous Korean 10-step skin care program. You can find all major brands here and then some - including Innisfree, Etude House, TonyMoly, etc. Try to visit the Line Friends store with the famous photo opportunity with their giant bear. There is also a muti-story Daiso (kind of like a Korean dollar store, but not everything is a ""dollar"") and Lotte Store (department store).Definitely try the street food for some fun food options. Korea is also known for their character socks (like super hero socks, Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, etc.) that are sold for about $1-3 USD (or about 1,000-3,000 Korean won).This a good place to wander around for a half or full day. Also a good place for some Korean souvenirs. "
Language Problem,The price moderate. Difficult to communicate. Crowded at night but a lot of things we can see and buy. The environment nice and clean.
Nice place to eat and shop,Myeongdong is a very busy area. Good place to eat and shop. It’s very crowded but it’s worth a trip. 
Packed shopping & Street food spot,I walked around the area with a friend on a Friday night. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants in the area as well as many shops of different kinds - even underground shopping too. There are some bars as well but definitely more known for its food and shopping.
Having a gander ....,"A buzz of activity - with loads of food stalls, shops and restaurants. Also seemingly more organised than Taipei’s night markets and better spaced out - ie you still have some personal space. Depending on what you are looking for this could either be a treasure trove of noises/smells/shopping/people watching or it could be boring. I dare say that if it’s the latter you wouldn’t be minded to venture to this district. I would hesitate to call it a shopping street as that sort of implies a single street - it’s not - It’s a sizeable shopping district. "
Exciting night market!,Walking along the streets during the winter nights among the many street vendors selling different delicacies invokes excitement. The market is different fr the ones in SG. Beauty and branded sports shops and cafes lining up the streets adds on to the exciting atmosphere. There’s something foreveryone!
Average,"Even though it's a long street, the shops are repeated so essentially it's just a really short stretch of shops. Mostly beauty and make up products. Their main targets seem to be Chinese tourists, and they sell things in bulk (e.g. 80 face mask sheets). Some decent street food. "
KR street food,"Ranging from 3000Won to 8, this street is the ultimate experience on street food. Too bad no blood sausage or other traditional stuff seen in KD dramas but I think this is the best place to start. Foreigner friendly and accessible.Toilet is in one of the malls unless you are dining in a restaurant... clean but a bit out of the way, so try not to drink too much :)"
Korean Holiday,"Myeong-dong is Seoul’s shopping mecca and is a must-see for tourists, but it is not just a shopping destination; Myeong-dong is also a hub of commerce, banking and culture with a daytime population of 1.5-2 million. For shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire, as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices. Myeong-dong is very popular with international visitors and fills with Japanese and Chinese tourists during the holiday period known as “Golden Week” which takes place in spring and is called golden week due to the week-long holiday period that takes place in Japan and China. Part of Myeong-dong’s popularity stems from relatively affordable prices here, especially compared to the other shopping meccas of Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong."
Street food! Shopping! Restaurants!,I think there is full of review here! I am glad I stay here and we enjoy very much! Everything you need is just walking distance. Something to take note is that Korea subway it's just not very kids friendly if you have a stroller. Will be a nightmare for you! 
Super bargain and freebies! ,Korean shopping at Myeongdong is a totally different experience than that of other cities! The Koreans are very accomodating and friendly and they give so many freebies when you purchase an item. Most of the items are negotiable so its good! And they are very honest in doing tax refund which is “unheard of” in some countries! A great experience for sure!! 
Our favourite shopping area in Seoul,"Firstly the underground station Myeongdong houses a huge shopping mall.The area is filled with a huge assortment of food shops, shops selling clothes, cosmetics and to numerous things to list.Great street food and the whole area just buzzes with excitement.Restaurants and entertainment are plentiful.A must on your list of places to see."
Everthing you need is all at Myeongdong...,Everthing you need is at Myeongdong... I was staying at Hotel Price which just across the street. I suggest you spend at least 2 trip there( I went Myeongdong for 3 night straight) as the 1st Trip...check price before buy...next trip buy all you can carry.
Super ,"Place full of cosmetic products. Every corner, the same brand, street food is all around. Great to walk around even one is not buying. "
Late night market,It is safe with easy access by train or cab.Lots of shops selling the famous Korean masks.Stick with the brand Innisfree.Lot of food carts around. Not so good for vegetarians.Spoken English is limited.Good bars too.
Be overwhelmed.,"This place offers various stores. A lot of beauty shops most especially. Offers a variety of street food! My fave part, just wish there were trash cans cuz so many people would leave there trash. So many people, if you're claustrophobic and you just hate crowds, not a place for you. But if you love shopping and food, definitely worth it! Lots of cafes to getaway from the crowd from time to time when shopping."
Shop till you drop!,"Needless to say, Meyongdong is a shopper's heaven. Husband and I did, what's called a 'K-haul' from here and Hongdae. Best beauty brands have multiple outlets. We spent a lot of time at Olive Young, a drug store where you can find most brands! Innisfree, Cosrx (at Aland), Tony Moly, Etude House, Missha, The Face Shop are among the countless beauty brands we shopped for.We got there early the first time and spent almost the whole day, taking food and drink breaks and dropping shopping bags to our Airbnb which was only one station away. The area starts to get alive only after 6pm though. Lot's of vendors come out on the streets and the crowd starts to get thicker. A lot of shops don't open till 10 am so no point getting here too early."
"A Fun Place To Visit, Especially At Night","Myeongdong is actually a district or a series of streets rather than only one. It attracts residents and visitors because of the shops, upscale department stores, restaurants, amazing street-food carts at night, underground malls and more. I recently stayed for 10 days at a hotel in the area and really enjoyed the location because of the activity.The district has two main streets, one that starts at the Myeongdong subway station and the other at Lotte Department Store by the Euljiro 1 subway stop, exit 6. Though shops offer everything from clothing to jewelry, Korean cosmetics and beauty creams seem to predominate with hawkers sometimes standing outside, offering free samples to entice passersby to enter. Side streets seem to go every which way, so it is easy to get lost. When that happened to me, I would look for two people in red uniforms. These signify men and women available to answer questions and give directions. At least one member of the pair speaks English. There are also tourist information offices around, where employees speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.When night falls, neon signs brighten the streets and food carts appear. Crowds descend on the area and walking almost comes to a standstill. Food items for sale include noodles, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, kimchi pancakes, lobster, dumplings and the list goes on. Hundreds of people stand there and eat in the street. For those not into shopping, consider coming here at night to sample the food."
Good place to buy cosmetic and skin care,"Great shopping place for tourists to get cosmetics and skin care products. Same street with various stores selling same brand same product but the promotional package might offer different things, take your time to explore."
Vacation,Myeongdong definitely a must do. Clothing and food really affordable and the atmosphere is fabulous anything you want you can get.
Overpriced from street food to idols merchandise.,"For me, I will not buy or eat at Myeongdong shopping street, I rather walk a few hundred metres away to Namdaemun Market to shop and eat.The different of the prices are 2000-3000 won for eating in a shop.And you can still bargain for shoes,clothing and idols merchandise stuffs here at Namdaemun.But of course if you want branded things you should go to Myeongdong"
Overpriced streetfood,"The streetfood is definitely overpriced. And the stalls are repeated, so you see different people selling similar food items in the whole stretch. With the amount of money we spent on streetfood, we could have had a decent meal in a proper restaurant."
Ready for street food,Myeongdong is not just a shopping area for beauty products but known for its street food. We taste various street food at pricey amount. Some store give free face mask but others if you dnt purchase any in their store they will get again the face mask
night life,this place is noisy and busy and colourful at night. Hawkers set up portable carts on the pedestrianized street. Lots of street snacks but prices are ridiculous. 6500W for a juiced promegranate! 25000W for a pack of strawberries. 
Organized chaos,"Definitely an active shopping experience, not for agorophobics. Shops of all kinds and sizes are side by side on narrow streets with colorful sings and throngs of people. Clothes, cosmetics, knick knacks, food, brand names and unknown brands are on display. "
Nice streetfood and shopping experience,"Nice place. Interesting experience and good street food. Went for the second time in 2018, first in 2017. "
Lively and fun,"Myeongdong shopping street is fun, lively and bursting with energy. There are all kinds of shops, department stores and restaurants. There is also a great variety of street food. Several of the local cosmetic shops offer a free sample face mask if you come into the store and browse. There are free concerts sometimes. I happened to see two very different but good concerts on two separate occasions. "
Biggest Shopping District in South Korea,"This is the biggest shopping district in South Korea. Things are not that cheap so think twice before buying.Easily accessible, lots of street food and restaurants too."
Very crowded with the same stores over and over again.,"First of all, I know it’d be crowded cause it’s a tourist area, which isn’t the issue. The problem I had mainly was the entire shopping street was just the same stores over and over again spread out. Like 6 Tony Moly, Etude House, Clio, etc makeup brands store just scattered throughout the street. So it’s not like the entire street is different, it’s like the same stores. Kind of overrated. "
Lots of food and shopping around,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund when shopping."
Shopping Paradis,"Who will miss this place? Lots of street foods, cosmetics and clothes. Not forgetting, there are cafes and is right above the subway!"
Walk Shop Eat Photos (Wasep),"This place just shouts BUY ME. The streets are literally lined with shops! All the cosmetics, clothes, and great food! What's more, there are guides posted in specific areas where you can ask questions. We asked what food would be good to eat and what restaurant. They give you a map which is veeeery helpful too."
Shopping sensation,"Tons of shop selling skin care product, clothes and restaurant. Street food cart normally start operating on late afternoon. The place can get real crowded especially at night and weekend. One stop paradise for those who likes to shop and eat."
Beauty product Heaven for Man and Ladies,"Be ready to be accosted by free sample giving shop assistants and be ready to be wowed by all the products on offer. Before you buy anything, do check out this shop Baviphat, they have good discounts for some of the popular brands. Sometimes even 50%, I know, amazing right? Obviously I bought a lot :)"
Cosmetic Heaven,"Cosmetic Heaven. This is the phrase to describe it. You will be spoilt with plenty of cosmetic products such as facial cream, facial masks and so on. There are lots of promoters offering discounts on their products. At the end of the day, it is more of a question of preference and good bargain that will influence your spending. There are also lots of other shops around such as fashion boutiques, sports boutiques such as Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc. Overall, the place to be when you are in Seoul."
My Myeongdong Experience,"Myeongdong was the first place we went immediately after we checked-in from our accommodation, as it was so popular Seoul destination among tourists. Since it was a Friday, there were many tourists and there were lines of different street foods which are yumny and appetizing. Hence, we tried some of those and they were delicious but a little pricey compared to some delicious street foods we have here in the Phil. Shopping is fun as there were great items specially beauty and skin care products, where stores give lots of samples when you purchase. Tourists get to enjoy tax refund when you present your passport. Restaurants are all over, hence you can't go hungry while shopping. We had so much fun and enjoyable experience in Myeongdong when we splurged some money we saved for our Seoul trip. It's a happy place which we would definitely go back to in Seoul."
Highly Recomended,"Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Great food, great value $$ shopping, fanastic beautiful autum scenery and safe environmental local exploration.. "
Meandering through Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism districts – so as you walk around, you’ll see many makeup stores, clothing stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.As night begins to draw closer, people will begin setting up food stalls, so I highly recommend you stay to experience the food (I had my first Korean sweet potato at one of these food stalls! GOOD LORDY LORD WAS IT EVER DELICIOUS!)."
Huge ,Now this place takes markets to a different level it is spread out over a few blocks and it’s has just about everything from fresh produce to led lighting and some great food stalls try the mungbean fritters their great and you don’t get hassled their are also information people here and around certain parts of the city dressed up in red outfits to help you 
Nice shopping with eats,"Was there almost everyday on all of our stay in Seoul for past 8days, really lively shopping streets and like never ending fun and excitment. altho most shop selling same stuff, like cosmetic and accessories, the other street vendor does provide another revenue of excitment. theres a middle lane that sells food, of all kinds, but personally felt the price was steeper than other place, so we just try soe on our first day, like cheese lobster, garlic prawns (fav), pancakes, promogrenate drink, mixed friut drink, 21cm ice cream etc. but the most interesting is the small lane after that eat street that turns into another lane of chicken & beer joints, that feature 5-6 joint in one lane, plus DTF and 2 other western cafe, so we chose 1 on each day, do try out the 678 chicken, BHC and TwoTwo. oh and dun be afraid to que, coz its fast going."
Packed and Lively Street,"Myeongdong must be the busiest street I have ever visited in Seoul. There were so many tourists and locals. Eating your street food might be quite a challenge especially with a stroller in tow because there's almost nowhere to stop.There are many shops, street food stalls, restaurants. It is good to sample the food here but the prices are more expensive than in Hongik or in Ehwa."
Much the same,"If you have been to one market in Korea you have been to them all. Don't get me wrong it is fun and a wonderful experience, however, they are all much the same. A ton of people, food, and your typical carts. The food is wonderful and you can get some good prices on things."
Great food(street and gourmet) and shopping!,So I went to myeongdong area with a friend to shop fall/winter clothes!! We took the subway which is a very fast way to get to myeongdong! Also uljiro1ga station leads you here! We went around 3 pm on a Sunday and had brunch at myeongdong goya!! Michelin guide dumpling place!! Not expensive which was good!! The stores were a bit crowded but it was not bad. Also the street food is kind of expensive and they only accept cash so that was not very convenient. Almost all stores’ staff speak English Chinese and Japanese which is convenient for tourists!!
A MUST PLACE TO GO,Shop till you drop here. A lot can be shop here. From cheap to expensive range. A must visit for travellers
"Shop, eat, sleep","A few tourist attractions are easily accessible from Myeongdong. There’s also the convenience of the subway and the airport bus. If you are into K-beauty, this is the place to shop for beauty products. There’s the Night market, plenty of street food, restaurants and cafes’ and shops.Lotte and Shinsegae are two major shopping / dept stores. The food court at Lotte is great!"
Bussy Street with lots of shop,I enjoy staying in Myeongdong. Hang out and try lots of food along the walk.My friends said that you can get lots of sample of beauty product when you walk in Myeongdong Street . Actually it is not really true.The way they gave you their product promotion is like not sincere. They ask you to enter the shop not just giving away the product to try. I dont really like the way . I dont really need the beauty product anyway heehehehehhe.
Shopping,"This is every woman's paradise when it comes to make up and beauty product shops and clothing as well. Every where you turn there is a shop for you. Lets not forget the street food, you must try all they have to offer. From potato tornado to baked cheesy scallops. Every travellers must visit in Korea"
A Bustling Place,"Shops in this area cater to all genders and opens late into the night. From cosmetics, clothings to sportswear, from locals to intl brands. There is a food street full of mouth watering seafood and local food. Many good coffee shops and local restaurants around. The underground shopping is the best among all. For high end shopping one can go to Lotte and New World duty free. Service there was good and can get tax refund on the spot. This place is a must to visit when in Seoul."
A little piece of heaven,"One can find all types of cosmetics here as well as tonnes of local restaurants, cafes and a few western restaurants. There are also street food stalls mainly open at night."
Get ready to eat & shop!,Get your stomach ready for all the street food you can eat! Not only that but you can shop for everything you want and more!
Visited Myeongdong with my friend,"Few months ago, I went Myeongdong with my Korean friend. We went Myeongdong fr bought some products and eat delicious food. In Myeongdong, there were so many kinds of street food such as chesses, Grilled Lobster with Butter, and juice. Also, there were so many cosmetics stores. In there, we can saw alomst kinds of cosmetics stores, restaurants or clothing stores. If you want to buy something during stay in Myeongdong, you can buy it immediately. Howvere the one thing that I was sad was there are too many people to do sometimg. For example, if you want some restaurent which is famous, you have to wait or reservation. Except this one thing, Myeongdong was the one of the best place that I played."
Go in the evening,"It’s mad busy with lots of street food. I’m not into shopping, but it was fun just to soak up the atmosphere - and then escape as it was soooo busy."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This area is food and shopping haven. Besides the street foods there are also lots of cafes and restaurants around. Lots of different brands of cosmetics to choose from. Each stores have their own ways to lure people inside to do some shopping in one way or another. Lots of cosmetic brands have more than one outlets. it seems like they are all over the place. Most tourist never miss this place when visiting Seoul. It's like a must visit place when you are in the area. Just bring lots of cash because it's hard to resist the aroma of foods.
Foods and Shopping,The street that famous that you can read it up everywhere introduction Seoul. A must visit for all your cosmetic products and a food haven by night. One visit might not be enough for some. 
"bright lights , large crowds cheap eats and fun street","myeongdong was only 10 min walk from my hotel , so i went there immidiately after chk in . it is super busy !! large crowds, neon lights and so many food places and bars to choose from . its great just for people watch and carnival atmosphere. i had dinner in a korean restaurant chicken galbi only $6 us so cheap and so good , they cook the food right in front of you chicken, rice , and kimchi . i went back there every night to hang around and eat , its good for shopping and also many money changers with reasonable rates !do not miss when in seoul ! "
Cosmetics Paradise and Street Food Heaven,"If you love cosmetics, then this is paradise for you. But what if you don't care about cosmetics? The street food will come to your rescue. The food stalls start setting up as early as 2pm. Either way, cosmetics or street food, be prepared to shell out a lot of money. Cosmetics are cheaper here but you will be tempted to buy everything that the salesladies offer to you. The top of my hand where they slather samples of the moisturizers, swatches of makeup, actually misses all the attention it got there. As to the street food, you think you're getting a bargain just having it for dinner. But before you know it, you've bought from 5 stalls and spent 30,000 won trying everything out. Good luck if your accommodation is in this area. You'll be broke by the middle of the week. Thank goodness I can charge the cosmetics to my credit card."
First time in Seoul!,Full of street food and cosmetic shops! Conveniently located near train stations. Vibrant and bustling!
Shopping,We stopped here after Insa-dong and it was much busier but the shopping did not disappoint. Some of the souvenirs are a little more expensive than Insa-dong but a lot is comparable. This place gets pretty busy with cars driving through crowds of people. The street food is amazing! Definitely worth stopping to!
Awesome place at night,"Went here twice while i was in Seoul, street food heaven, plenty of sweets, seafood, meats and baked good available. surrounded by cosmetic shops and shopping centres. watch out though some hawkers use the halal sign without even knowing what halal is. but plenty of choice, defo worth a visit when in Seoul."
Good for a one off visit,Our hotel was about 1km so we walked easily to this location. Went twice in 10 days. We felt that one walk through was adequate.
Interesting street food and shopping experience..,"Good experience, haggle well. Nice street food. Quite a lot of interesting stuff being sold by hawkers."
Street Food and Shopping Heaven,"Street food! Grilled squid, prawn and lobster, baked chesee, egg bun, steamed corn and sweet potato, tteokbokki, steak, tshirt, shocks, shoes, beauty products, what else you're looking for? just name it!Restaurants is all over the corner, international brand and local just right at the same area!Strolling around this area and you will find anything and you'll never get bored! Well this is truly tourists area where you'll be happy to get lost here just make sure you empty your stomach and bring the cash!"
Enjoyable Shopping Experience,Nobody does street shopping better than Asia and the Myeongdong was not exception. And the big plus is that the shop owners and shoppers are very considerate (with the exception of a few ugly tourists). And at night the place really lights up - don’t miss the experience.
Exciting street filled with food and shopping,"Fun area to take a stroll in the evening. Everything from high-end shops to streetcar boutiques. In addition, a nice variety of delicious street food at low prices. Definitely worth stopping by if you’re in the area."
Awesome selection of Korean street food!,Spend an evening walking down Myeongdong Shopping Street. Eat and shop. Very creative and tasty food selection. Must visit when in Seoul. 
Myeondong food street,The best of korean street food can be found just as you stroll around the streets of myeondong shopping market at night.
Lots of street food,"I love the street food. Its yummy and cheap, well cheaper than restaurant food. Lots of shopping also."
Loving Myeong-dong!,A tourist friendly shopping street at the heart of Seoul. Glad that they have this to tour around for free. Free cosmetics is a must!
Beauty products and street food,Plenty of shopping and eating. I went with the rose gelato and fried shrimp. Also purchased a few beauty products (without skin whiteners). A few hours seems enough.
Superb Night Market!,"If you happened to visit Seoul, this is a must visit to those seeking local snacks, beauty stuffs like masker, lotion, etc or looking for the best specialty coffee in the country. This is a must visit place."
"Shop for your skincare and make up here, but not for street food","This street is full of beauty product. You can find korean cosmetic product in this street. And sometimes they offered you free sheet mask if you enter the shop even if you end up don't buy anything. For the street food, there're a lot of it. But beware, it's so expensive. For the lobster with cheese it will cost you 15.000Won, for an octopus satay it will cost you 10.000Won etc"
Shopping spree,The best place you should go if you looking to buy cosmetic and enjoying the Seoul best cosmetic company.
Must Visit,"A must visit place. The whole Myeongdong area is huge. There are boutique shops, restaurants, coffee shops, dessert places and more in the whole area!"
Beauty product shopping paradise!,"It is the highlight of my trip to S Korea. It has all the popular beauty product stores on the street. Great selections. Also has a lot ,a lot of. delicious food on the street. A must visit place if you are travelling to S Korea. I will definitely go back again."
Plenty of streetfood,"Plenty of streetfood, some are a bit more expensive than stalls you find near the university precincts. "
Busy street with lots of shopping,"We came here to visit the big UNIQLO store, which was great. There are heaps of other shopping options. There's a subway station right in the heart of the area, lots of street food and good pedestrian areas, so it's certainly a shoppers paradise. We came at about midday and it wasn't crowded yet."
Shopping shopping shopping ,Perfect place to shop till you drop. You will find everything you need here within the several blocks of stores and restaurants.
It is an exciting experience,"To walk in the evening for this place is to find a living city site, calm people, food of all types and open stores for hours until late at night."
Shut Up,Just a busy high street except though it appears pedestrian friendly it's not it's down right dangerous. You will not hear the traffic be it truck or moped because of music blaring away from outside the shops and people trying to get you into them. It's difficult to know whether you are being man handled into a store or rescued from a speeding car behind you. Good luck.
Shopping heaven ,"Beware for ladies! There's so much of skincare products and masks for you girls to dive in. You can go broke by just spending 1 or 2 nights at this area. Of course, besides skincare, there's a lot more retails in this area. Various of food choices to choose from; restaurants or street food. "
Amazing shopping street,We went here specifically to go moderate price Korean cosmetic shopping. There are many shops with good prices. The thing that surprised me most is all of the street food and it all looked amazing.Very safe area
Busy Shopping street,"Myeongdong is a bustling and colorful shopping street. You will find a lot of local brands like Top 10, Innis free and other cosmetic stores. Big brands like Zara, Adidas and Nike stores are also there. Street food is common in the area and a lot of restaurants can be found in the area as well. Worth your while to go around the this area."
A great little area,"Well worth visiting as there are loads of shops should you ever need to buy anything. Lots of food stalls around to have a nibble whilst walking. Very interesting street, well worth spending a few hours here."
Crowded shops along the entire street,Call it the main cosmetics street of Seoul with all kinds of brands lining the street. It was too crowded so it was not really my type of area.
paradise for shopping...heaven of korean cosmetics world...,"As i m a boy i m not interested in cosmetics but it's a good place to buy cosmetics coz so cheap in wholesale price...But as a street food lover,let's say it's a paradise... I really love this place for street foods... Good place to do window shopping as well... Anyway u should visit there..."
Face mask!,Get off at Myeong-dong Station exit 6 and you can start shopping. There’re Korean brand beauty shops every 5 steps so you know one of the items you must get is face mask and make up. Besides that there are brand and cheaper stores selling clothes and few shops selling Korean snacks - great for souvenirs. Restaurants are plenty too. Tourist assistants are walking around to assist.
Food trip were Great ,just went their for street food trip and dog cafe ... it was nice though walking around the street ... food were really good and affordable... 
The food is why you go,"There are lots of stores, clothes, cosmetics, shoes, but the real appeal is the food carts.Ranging from cheap ddobbki to real lobster tails there is something for every price range and food preference. Dont like street food, there are plenty of restaurants from K-bbq to McDonalds"
cosmetic center and more,"myeong dong street is a place that you must visit to see and buy the cosmetic requirements ( face masks/ shampoos/ skin care creams) you will find a lot of shops along the street. also there are a lot of clothing shops (brands) near the Main Street. the street design and shops location with the music surrounded will let you stay there forever. you can reach this location by using the bus to myeong dong station or you can use the metro. recommended time to visit (before sunset). time needed there 2 house for singles, 4 hours for married."
Great street food ,"Near to myeong dong train station. Always fill with people, tourists and locals. Many different street food available. Together with many cosmetics shops nearby. Great place to kill time. "
Delicious street food,"A must visit street for tourist. Great food variety but pricey in some stalls. Must try the Egg bun, lobster roll, and cheese scallops!"
Nice place,Super nice place.. after 5lots of streetfood... made it super crowded sometimes.But nice experience overall 
Cosmetics everywhere,"This shopping area is quite big but definitely can be covered within a couple of hours. There are many restaurants throughout but they are more hidden within alleys or up the stairwells. There are many repeats of the same stores over and over again, so I’m not too sure if it’s necessary to cover the whole area for some. At about 5-6pm, food stall vendor will line the Main Street. The food is excellent and there’s a huge variety, but it is slightly overpriced for certain items."
Fantastic ,"Our hotel was just at the end of this street, Amazing food and stalls. So much variety you can wander and try things for hours. Everything was clean all the vendors had fresh clean equipment and produce.There is a police station close and tourist police if you need them.It felt very very safe walking around at anytime and there are volunteers who speak English to assist if you need.Most vendors had a little English and we could make do with buying.If your in Seoul don’t miss out"
The Myeongdong Experience,It was our first time in Korea so the Myeongdong area was a treat for us with all the various shops plus street food variety. Be prepared with a budget for the things you may buy or the food you want to experience.
Vacation,Very nice to spend s dayLots of ShopsLots of foodCoffee shopsIndoor. Outdoor. Expensive and inexpensive
Good street Food and lots OF shopping.,"The street is for walking only which is very good because OF all The crowd and street Food stalls. IT is a long walk and The side streets are full OF restaurants, shops, pharmacy etc. IT is a complete place for almost everything. A must place to Go in The City."
RAD!,"One of our most amazing travel experience! The street becomes more alive around 4-5pm. Locals and Tourist conglomerate in the area for some shopping and or a taste of probably the best street foods! This is a must if you visit Seoul. Very diverse shopping with all the skin care products ( be careful not to get sucked in when they dangle a carrot to enter their stores), high end shopping, street cart shopping, luxury, knock- offs and best of all the array of very innovative food from Pajeon (Korean pancake), Gimbap, dumplings, rice cakes, barbecues on a skewer, egg bread, spiral potatoes, lobster with cheese and many more.... just packaged or handed to you with delight! Just go and experience it!"
Heaven for girl(shopping),"All shopping you can get it here, from street to mall, especially fashion and cosmeticsStreet food also good to try , especially the egg bun and squid bbq.Money changer available here, dun worry you dont have money to shop"
One long street market,"Unless you are into shopping, this is just another average shopping place so many locations around Seoul."
Food Stalls are Must Visit,"With a plethora of food stalls, each with its unique flavor and decoration, come hungry and with cash! There's endless shopping, everything from imitation Supreme gear sold on the street to the Louis Vuitton and other designer stores across the street connected to the Lotte department store. There are beauty stores and restaurants.You don't need more than 2 hours here unless you're really trying to do some serious shopping. Two hours is enough to get the gist and fill your belly. Myeongdong tends to be super crowded and as with the rest of S. Korea trash cans are limited so save a plastic bag from your latest purchase for trash"
Great street!,"Many shops! Many restaurants! Sure have what you want! If you are done with the street, there are a few malls there too."
So tempting to shop and make all your money drop!,This is a good place to do all your shopping spree. But be mindful of the money you have. The food is expensive so as the clothings but it's all tasty and fashionable.
Was staying nearby ,"Lots of shops selling facial products/ cosmetics , shoes , clothing etc. the food stalls are clean. I bought my sandwich at one of the stall when Isaac was closed "
Shop Shop & Shop,"DDP is good to shop clothing and Myeongdong is for you to shop cosmetics. There are a few good hotels inside the shopping street, it is very convenient if your aim is to shop until the last second. Plenty of F&B outlets for you to chose and lots of cafe too. Street food are also available but I found it not cheap.... "
Just okay,Okay shopping. It seems there are at least four of every store in the relatively small/short shopping area.
Great shopping experience ,"Myeongdong shopping street is probably the most famous amongst tourist.Very lively in the evening and nights. Most of the shops close by 11pm.Loads of beauty product shops. Do your research before buying any of the face mask. Like brand, your skin, which mask will suit you. Pricing in different shops, sale discount etc. Another place to get a good bargain for the beauty products is lotte shopping centre which is another area.Myeongdong shopping has got some good street food so definitely try them. "
The main shopping hub~,"Come here to get your fix of cosmetics, skincare, street foods! Full of tourists so there are also plenty of restaurants around here. But now, the skincare brand shops like Tony Moly, The Saem, etc are so pushy where if you take the free mask that they offered on the street, they literally push you into the shop :(So rude. So if you are not interested in the brand, dont take their freebies offered."
Good introduction to Korean street food and shopping.,"Our first day in Seoul was at Myeongdong and it was a very interesting site for visitors like me who loves food. The streets were lined up with carts and carts of street food, and different kinds, as well as shops selling clothes and a lot of cosmetic products. Sampling the street food was a very enjoyable experience, and filling too. Again, wear comfortable shoes (and bring lots of money)."
Stayed here in Myeongdong street,"It has a lot of cosmetic shops, you get free cosmetic samples and a lot of eateries/ street food. A must visit for street food lovers/ street shoppers. Also currency exchange rates are good here."
Great as far as Shopping Street go!,"Stayed for 2 weeks near the Myeongdong Shipping street. We only made one purchase (mostly b/c we still had 3 more months of travel ahead of us and didn't want to carry the extra weight around). Is a great place to visit for all sorts of shopping, especially K-beauty. There are literally 3-4 storefronts for the same beauty shops scattered throughout the shopping district, so its easy to get lost. Make sure you have the Naver app to help you navigate the small streets. "
Definitely a must,"A huge shopping area for street food, cosmetics and sneaker brands. Its a definitely must visit place when you are in Seoul !"
Beauty Heaven & Delicious Foods ,"one of the main reasons that I wanted to visit the city of Seoul was for the beauty products that the country is so famous for. The shopping street isn’t actually just one street - it’s multiple that veer off from the main one. You’ll find tons of different brand names, some you’ll recognise and some you won’t. I would heavily advise that you give the brands you don’t recognise a chance as some of the best products I picked up where from these places. My advice would be to take a bag with you as you’ll end up with a ton of samples simply for looking around a store you are usually handed a free face mask or moisturiser sample and these can stack up pretty quickly. You’ll also as a visitor be eligible for a tax refund on products if you spend over 50,000 won as well as being given samples from the stalls for purchasing products. At night while the beauty stores remain open, the night market comes to life with various different types of vendors. There’s some pretty amazing food on offer (the eggy bread was amazing) but you’ll also find some bags/phone cases / T-shirt’s etc. There was an abundance of knock-off supreme and off-white items available on the stalls."
Good place to shop cosmetics and street food,"This place is a heaven for people who love to shop cosmetics and eat street food. Here you’ll find good deals of famous korean stores such as missha, etude, laniege. My friend found a lower price for cosmetics around Busan but when in Seoul, shops here are of reasonable price. Also try to roam around first when buying other souvenir items (like socks) as some stores offer better deal than others. "
Must visit when in seoul,"If you are looking for street food and skin care brands, come to Myeongdong. Other stores such as jdsports, abc mart etc. Alot of restaurant along the main street and also in the alleyway. Come at night as it is very lively with the street vendors."
Bustling night market,"The usual bustling of night markets can be found here. All types of Korean and top brand products can be found.The food stalls line the streets as you walk by, be brave enough to try a bite when passing the food stalls it is a must when there.Lots of facial products and other cosmetics for the ladies.A must visit when in the area."
This is THE shopping paradise!,"We spent 3 days and 2 nights shopping here. Night food sold on street stalls are goid experiences, DO ask for the prize before ordering!There was no price tag on a FROZEN Smore, my teen ordered without knowing the price. (The price 2000won was only for the egg tartlet besides the FROZEN SMORE!) It was a whopping 8000 won for FROZEN smore which is actually marshmallow covered icecream (LOL)Beauty stores= Prices are all displayed. 1! Show your passport for tax free purchases2. Make sure you ask ""may I have free samples?"" when you are at the cashier. They grab a bunch of facial products into your bag of paid items (Freebies)Same as clothing stores and others, ask about ""tax free"", they will have options, instant tax refund (scan passport) , refund within store (ABC Mart), documents to claim tax refunds at airport or Lotte outlets.. Eat your hearts out, Myeondong Kyoja noodles since 1966 is still our best choice"
Really weird,"Hyper activities: a myriad of stands, restaurants, shops.Immerse yourself for some time, but plan to ""escape"" after some time..."
Bustling indeed!,"As we stayed in the heart of Myeongdong for 6 nights, I can say without a doubt that Monday was the least crowded - also because the food stands were mostly on a break! On Tuesdays from 5pm it gets pretty packed and crazy again!This is the place to pick up all the main cosmetic brands and also a chance to snack on all the “local” street snacks. What I liked about it was that you can find all the big korean brands here so it feels like a one-stop along with sportswear. It’s like the “in” thing right now so there are many sneakers/sports shops at each corner from Adidas to JD to New Balance etc. Highly recommend for all who are visiting!"
busy and lively place,"a lot of famous cosmetic brands, shopping malls which attracts visitors of different countries to go here, eat and shop"
Bustling Wonderland,"Myeongdong is not a quiet place for serenity.This is a popular area about ½ square kilometers in size with a plethora of shopping and restaurants along narrow streets that still allow cars. There usually are only a few vehicles traveling slowing amongst the crowd. There were many street food vendors when we were there, but I personally was not too impressed with the quality of the food. It’s a good place to be when you want to feel the bustle of lots of people out and about. We didn’t notice any rowdiness and felt quite safe."
Never tired of Myeongdong Street,"In the 5D4N in Seoul, we were at Myeongdong almost everyday and never tired of it. Each day we see something different. My son and I enjoyed our time shopping and buying at Myeongdong - my second visit to Korea."
Amazing- forget bangkok,"There are 1000's of shops in the area. from reasonably priced to expensive.Name it ,it is there. On the weekends the streets transform into a night food market. I'm sure there were over 500 food stalls. If you are there over the weekend ...you must do it.."
Heaven streets for skincare,"Mostly all kinds of cosmetics and skincare products. Apart from this some shops employed very rude sales girls. When they try to speak to you in mandarin and you could'nt understand they will turn you away and also if you don't buy from them, they will snatch back the gifts from you !"
Only for shoppers,"The whole street is bout shopping shopping and shopping.U can get cheap beauty products but make sure do survey a few shops.When evening come , there s a lot of street vendors selling local food and souvenirs.I find it on the high price but still i did try some local delights"
Shopping galore,If your main hobby is shopping then this is a heaven for you! A lot of things to buy and see.. street food is also everywhere..
Huge shopping and street food area,"Myeongdong is a really huge area full of shopping streets and street food. The place literally comes alive in the evening time and gets crowded with both locals and tourists that come here to shop for beauty products, clothes, souvenirs and to eat some of the amazing street food that can be found all over the area.We visited the Line Friends store as well as many beauty product stores for my wife and toy shops for our kids. We tried many types of street food as so much of it looked delicious, as it indeed was, and even managed to visit the McDonald's for our kids.This is definitely one of the liveliest and most exciting places that we visited in Seoul and is an absolute must visit place to anyone planning to visit Seoul."
Cosmetics,"We had so many choices of face masks and creams. Good prices but walk with your passport for tax free options, credit cards accepted. Some stores give samples if you are buying a lot."
Lively,This was a great place for night market for food. There was a huge array of shops there too. I ate there a few nights. I especially enjoyed the gimbap. I think South Korean sushi is lovely.
Similar products,"Even the night markets are somewhat not as exciting, especially so, that this is my 2nd visit within 6years. The stores selling beauty care products are aplenty, but was told by Korean friends that these aren't the cheapest. Nevertheless, one can find a few good eateries like abalone porridge, soy bean noodles and a few good deserts like Sulbing."
Worth a visit ,"Get immersed in shopping hustle and bustle in this location. If you don’t like crowds, this may not be the place for you but if you like vibrant, fun locations then this is the place for you. Keep an eye out for the green tea coffee/tea places.. they’re full of pleasant delicious surprises! "
Shopping central,"The shopping epicenter of Seoul. You can find all the cosmetics, food, clothes and gifts you want all in this one area. Very crowded and noisy, but that's to be expected."
Good place for shopping,We could stay half day in Myeongdong because there are various of shops and restaurants. The currency exchange rate in this district is in good rate. We could buy clothes and souvenirs here. 
"Street Food On A Stick! Shrimp, Scallops, Abalone, Potstickers and More!","Sure, there is plenty of shopping to be done on the myriad of alleys and carts and small shops, but I'm going back again tomorrow night for the food. If you are a lover of street food, meat-on-a-stick and anything that can be fried or torched (see the pic), this is the place. Plenty of mom/pop/solo carts and, in the easily missed alleys within the alleys, are innumerable places to eat locally. The skewered dishes we had this even were in the 2000-4000 Korean Won range, making the evening greatly entertaining and a great value."
Great streets for Korean cosmetic and make-up brands,"These streets (there’s one main street with smaller ones off to the sides) were close to the hotel and we strolled around one evening, browsing the many cosmetic, make up and health shops, boutiques and sports shops. The area was buzzing with people and it had a lively atmosphere. A great place if you are looking for niche Korean brands; you’ll definitely find them here. "
One of the best places for shopping in Seoul,"You can get everything you need here : clothes, make up, accessories, get some yummy street food or go to a restaurant. Always crowded, noisy, but fun :) Always kpop music playing out loud for the mood too. Great place to hang out."
Wheelchair...yes can but,There's a lot shooping shop and place to eat. But not every shop and restaurant friendly for wheelchair. 
Everything You Need In One Place,"Shopping, food, relaxation. All in one place!All you need is to stay in a hotel around this area and you get all your needs fulfilled."

Something for everyone.,"Primarily a cosmetic shopping hub, it offers a wide range of restaurants, cafes, clothes stores and marts. A bunch of pop up eateries come up in the evening with amazing street food. Almost all major make up and cosmetics brands have outlets here, lots of freebies and samples to take home too! "
OVERWHELMINGLY GOOD!,"I have to admit, it was drowning with people and shops left and right that I was so shookt I ended up not buying anything, not one single thing the first time I was there! It had that effect on me. But when I went back the next day, I was finally able to grasp the situation and enjoyed my time there! :)"
" Nice street, ","Nice street, a lot of things to see and buy. I bought a lot of cosmetic products for my friends and colleagues. You also find nice Korean foods here as well and make you you try their grill beef and hot pot. "
First Class Adventure for Shoppers,"We took a taxi to Myeongdong and since it's in the center of Seoul it did't take long to get there. The shopping begins the second you get out of the taxi and doesn't stop until your purchases become to cumbersome to handle. There is so much to see, so many things for sale. There are plenty of interesting food stalls with many different varieties of snacks and drinks. The collage of sights is fantastic and a photographers dream. Don't miss this attraction."
Myeongdong,"Like many commercial street in Seoul, Myeongdong has the same structres. It's okay to go there for eating street food and buying something. I love the Church here. It's a nice Church where you should travel at least once time in your life. The picture is at the end of Myeongdong."
shopping,"if like shopping this is the place to go to, good products with reasonable prices. ladies will love it."
guided tour throu seoul ,i went with a tour guide (hyeyoung Seo ) who gave me an insight to the korean tradition history and culture ....she was verrrrry well informed ...loved this street and went back to it a day later ...i would say you can spend an hour before you head to insadong ...

Busy Street,"Our hotel is in Myeongdong. Thus, we are able to go for dinner and shopping merely by walking distance. Its very near n safe to walk during night."
Eat and shop!,"If you like walking bazaar sort of streets, this is the place for you. Lots of snack push carts and little items along this whole street. If you like, you can also walk into the shops and some are on level 2 or 3, so make sure you look for signages."
OK but nothing special,Lots of shops but none have anything special. I would rather shop at home. Why would you want Turkish items inKorea. Nice place for a stroll but we did not buy anything.

Good street food. ,We went on a weekend and there was a lot of options for street food. Easy access from subway. Lots of shopping and cafes to choose from. Fun to see the lively neighbourhood. 
Always busy,"We stayed close to Myeondong so passed through the main shopping street plenty of times during our stay and regardless of the time of day it was busy. It's easy enough to get disoriented especially if you are looking for somewhere listed in Korean (try using photos in TA listings or google streetview instead). There are plenty of shops to spend your money in (particularly cosmetics/beauty stores) including large fashion stores such as Muji. You'll also come across a number of street stall selling fashion items, and there is a vast array of street food on offer, so make sure you do try a few as they will suprise you as they are superb. It's a great place to observe local life."
"Energy and fun,... with some shopping around","Lots of positive energy, people, street stalls with great finger food to allow you stroll through the bustling pedestrian streets and enjoy it non stop. Lots of young people around, some tourists and plenty of shops with some interesting designs, known brands with a twist if you stay window shopping long enough to realise that there are some exclusive articles to grab,... very worth visiting, even if you are not looking at buying anything. A must place to visit if you want to grab some trendy stuff, or very trendy stuff!"
Fabulous nightlife in Seoul,"It's obvious that it's going to be crowded all the time but the vibe and atmosphere of the nightlife is fabulous. There's delicious street food, shops, and cosmetics galore as well as plenty of restaurants if you'd rather sit down and enjoy a meal. Highly recommend visiting Myeongdong when in Seoul."
Crowded and huge shopping street,"Myeong dong is famous for shopping haven in Seoul. So many choices of food stall but expensive, Korean cosmetics, famous Korean restaurants. It becomes crowded all day long. "
Vibrant,"this is very vibrant. Good area to shop around, cosmetics, clothings, shoes,street food, restaurants, cafe and etc. The place is crowded with people. From here you can also take the underground passage way to Lotte duty free shop."
Hub for Korean skin care products,"Best place to shop in Seoul. Food, clothes, shoes, accessories, toys, cosmetics, souvenirs almost everything can be bought there. If you are a fan of Korean skin care products then this is the place for you. You can also find many number of money changing shops. Quick Tip: 1.

4th TripTo Seoul,"It's a fantastic feelings to be visiting Seoul this time of the year.First week of October is probably the best time to visit. Weather is nice and cool without being too extreme. This is probably the best and relaxing trip. Seoul is the place to be if you enjoy shopping and eating. They have street food for your in between bites. Fantastic choice of BBQ restaurants to choose from. We are staying at the Grand Hotel near the Miyeongdon station. The rooms are nice and clean. The amenities are great. The location is just within walking distance of the shopping belt. You couldn't ask for more. Too bad , when you are having fun, it's time for us to depart for home.Goodbye Seoul and see you real soon.CheersBarry"
Shoppers and Foodies Mecca ,"Arrived at the area around 11 am , was wondering what was all the fuss about. By noon droves of people started appearing within an hour place was jammed packed. There are more stores selling cosmetics and skin products than anywhere I have ever seen . Every 3rd or 4th store was selling skin products.Food carts and hawkers started appearing on the streets. Literally every street had at least 8 to 10 Restaurants .Must for any visitor to be here."
Fun place to get street food!,Myeongdong is a great place to shop but it’s an even better place for street food! The main crossroads are lined with stalls selling delicious treats!
aw-mazing!!,"i feltin love with korea but not the price lol. i like being at this place and it made me forget the time. all famous korean beauty product was in here, fashion street yeah, street food yeah, here is the place, i had been told from my friend that it closes very early, at midnight. anyway, its good place to spend you money lol"
Great atmosphere and convenience for shopping and food,Tons of popular clothing stores and beauty product stores in close proximity! Delicious restaurants too. Currency exchange booth in the 7-11 store has the best rate. Different variety of delicious street food carts you can try.
Been there at Myongdong,"The place was so crowded, passing pedestrians, street vendors and so many small restaurants here. Very nice."
great shopping and food,The steet food was the best part! There are a great deal of shops but most are the same as you would see anywhere else. The street food however was fantastic. I tried several different things and it was a great experience. 
Crowded and Vibrant Shopping District!,"This place is one of the iconic shopping streets in Seoul. From designers shoes and bags to facial products, you name it they have it. Prices are not entirely cheap but the sheer variety of products will make you go crazy so get ready your wallets and shop till you drop!"
Shopping heaven ,"This place is RIDICULOUS - so many shops, especially skincare and beauty, plus loads of cute stores like Line Friends and ARTBOX. I saved up my shopping for the last day! There are loads of little side streets and turns you can take and it would be easy to get lost but it’s shaped like a grid so it’s actually not that difficult to find your way back to where you start, only problem is there are multiple sites for shops, like there’s about 3 branches of Tony Moly within the same area so don’t use a brand like that as your signpost! I recommend getting cake at Billy Angel while you’re there... "
The shopping place ,"Wow this is the place to be in Seoul , good street food and great shopping , all The masks and skin care , jewellery, clothing, shoes I love this place "
Shopping haven,"If you are looking for shop for cosmetics then you are in for a treat. If you are looking for shoes and food, then you can find them here too. Shops offer instant tax rebate and you can shop to your heart's content. "
I love this place,Myeongdong was my main place when I was in SK. I really love this place. People were so nice and all the stores are always open that you can buy almost anything. I also love the street food. It’s not so cheap but most of them are really good 
Great shopping area where can spend a day.,"Myeongdong tends to get crowded after 1100hrs until midnight. Lots of shops selling cosmetic, clothing and restaurant. A lots of movable stall selling Korea sttreet food but most of the never stated the price. Tourist tend to get cheated. Beware of one stall selling Oreo Churo by one Chinese women, one small oreo churo cost 3500won."
Food and shoppers heaven,"Simply the best, an amazing place to shop non stop. So many gift and allsorts of food stalls many variety of restaurants and even designer wear shops. The list goes on... love it love it love it. Its a must visit for those who travel to Seoul."
Cosmetics heaven!,"If you're crazy about Korean beauty and cosmetics, this is the place for you. Lots of shops like Innisfree, The Faceshop, Etude House, Olive Young, All Beauty Mask, Laneige, and many more. There are also lots of korean street foods and some halal foods as well. However, if you go there with kids they're gonna be bored following you around to find beauty products."
Shopping district + food hawkers = Myeongdong,"Once getting out of the station, therr will be scene of shops lining up the streets. Each shop would play different playlist - some would sound familiar, some would not. This place is best for buying beauty care (there are too many brands to mention, but I would like to recommend nature republic which is next to station exit). In case you need new clothes, go buy one at either Uniqlo (the biggest branch store in Asia) or a shopping mall next to nature republic. The shopping mall has 3-4 floors: men's clothing on first floor, women's on second floor. There are gorgeous clothings to find in there though some might be in low quality (I am saying this because the one I bought was not sewed tight enough. It might be damaged if I am not careful enough). About the food hawkers, the price might vary depends on what you eat and in which hawkers you buy. Take an example... One gyeranppang (Korean egg bun) costs 2000 won while roasted lobster tail with melted cheese costs you 15.000 won (I actually doubt the price... Was not it too expensive? I need to cross check about it)"
Mixed feelings.,Visited it in late evening. Shopping was great. Street foods were great. But we still expect to see more.
Great shopping and excellent street food,"I am not a shopper but enjoyed looking at the wares. I think Myeongdong Shopping Street had the most food vendors than any of the other street markets and the food was delicious. We loved the Hottoek, grilled shrimp, pork on a stick... actually, loved everything we ate there."
Boring if you aren’t a shopoholic,I found this area boring. It might as well be Tokyo or Paris. Same brands everywhere. The only thing which is different is that there is a lot of cosmetic shops. Since I don’t use that I found the area boring. Many other things to do instead.
Shops and street food ,Shops and street foods galore. Don’t have your meal before you come here. Stuff yourself with the delicious street food that fill this place. Clothes are cheap as well. 
Superb Market,"Loved this market. It was vibrant with tons of actions. I felt alive and ready to devour each and every street. Loved the restaurants, the shops, the cafes and many more little corners. "
Shopping city,Just wow. You could get lost easily as streets after streets are shops of all kinds. There's plenty of food to try as well.
Best shopping ever,"I am a huge fan of korean cosmetics and skincare. This place is heaven for shoppers because it has all the important shops in the same place, sometimes even 2/3 shops from the same brand in one street. And they give lots of free samples. In Myeongdong you can also find an underground shopping center with lots of clothes and not expensive at all. A must do in Korea"
Food street,"You will find lots of street food here, cheese lobster is a must-try! Many choice of cosmetics brand, and we also did enjoy Nanta Show at the Nanta Theater, located in the street itself. I explored the street twice on my visit recently, well its a tourist spot anyway."
A Heaven For Food and Shopping!,"When you go here, make sure that you have enough money to go on a shopping spree because you will spend on a lot of street food and a lot of skincare products! especially if you go gaga over those Korean trends."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This is a very busy street yet. Everything here is a bit more expensive than in other cities but the shopping center is more complete. Same goes with the food. It is more expensive here but there are more food choices. The lobster stand is a mush try!
Amazing Shopping And Amazing Food,"Thus area us a ""Must See"" for visitors. There is endless shopping, tons of resturants and coffee shops, countless street vendors. Prices are great...it is safe and friendly. Loved it!"
Too many cosmetics stores,Walked arouns for several hours and took in the street food scene. The street food was much better than the shopping as the was an abundance of cosmetic stores. 
Wow,It was an amazing experience going to myeongdong had foodtrip with the sumptuous street foods i really love it specially the fish cake..i also love the cosmetics shops with a lot of freebies 
Mid afternoon best ,"Some nice shopping to be had here, lots of cosmetics, but be sure to hang around till 5pm,, when all the street food vendors fill the streets! Delicious, authentic Korean food and delicacies cooked on the street. Yum! "
Full of street food,Tourist hideout...Retail therapy HQ... Full of Chinese tourist but you will get what you need for fashion and beauty items ...Food is in abundance too 
Amazing,Very fun place to walk around and look at the street food. I wasn't brave enough to have a taste of any of it though. If you are visiting Seoul you have to visit Myengdong.
Pricy cosmetic products,There were a lot of choices for cosmetic brands but they're quite pricy. Street foods quite pricy too.
Lots of cosmetic shop,"so many cosmetic shops, branded shop, food street, the best about this street, lots of cosmetic shops and you will get lots of gift from them to compare to other places of shops. food street usually starts in the evening."
Great Street Food,"Loved walking up and down the streets sampling the delicious street food. It seemed reasonable to me. The honey garlic shrimp was amazing, also the chicken, shrimp and cheese bowls. Lots of people so very crowded."
shopaholics place to be,"Love this area soo much! I can spend hours in every store. Food, cosmetics and clothing all in one place. "
Great shopping!,"Myeongdong is busy, but has everything you'd need from a Korean shopping experience, from beauty products to cat cafes to international brands, with great street food along the way."
Very nice ,Best place to do shopping in Korea Many shopping malls with different level of goods Cleans and safe Sure you will not go out with empty hands 
Shopping,"Loved the shopping, real buzz to this area, quite small and compact, but had 3 days here. Street food fantastic, but more expensive than I thought it would be."
Amazing experience,"Loved every bit of it..Lotte young plaza and lotte plaza are 2 of the bigger malls in this area. But you do get multiple other malls as well.You must visit the underground shopping center which is situated near the lotte young plazaIn the evening the area bursts into life with action stations of delicious street food. Craving for some of it right now!Shops are open till 10pm but the larger 2 malls close a bit earlier than that.Ooh and if you are a k-pop fan.. loads of merchandise!! Including pop up stores..I stayed at the sotetsu hotel, the splasir myeong-dong. Which was nice and cozy. However, there are many hotels around that area that you can try out as wellOverall.. a must visit. Im definitely visiting again!"
Excellent ,Alot of shops there. Alot of variety of shops especially make up and clotes for females. Food too. Recommended 
Shopping! Shopping!,"I was prepared. I knew I was going to buy many facial products. In fact, I pre-booked extra 15kgs going back just for my new goodies! My 2 friends who weren't sure what to expect also ended up shopping as much as I did.Myeondong is full of skin care brands left and right, as far as your eyes can see, as much as you can carry or afford. I really didn't notice much else like clothes, shoes, etc. I love all the freebies they give you for every purchase and how every sales personnel knows how to use the products they're selling. Prior to my trip, I watched some YouTube videos on skincare products. I also read lists and blogs so I was armed with screenshots of what I wanted. I found most of them without much effort. I could've tried harder to find the others but I got distracted with Artbox and Daiso so it's all good. Let's just put it this way, my 2 friends who were not as crazy with beauty products as I am said: We live in Innisfree. They're literally in Innisfree every day (we were in Seoul for 5 days) and sometimes, 2x a day. You can't help but consider, look, buy, consider, look, buy. Repeat. :-)Be prepared. :-)Tax refund until 1M Korean Won on each passport. Refund at the airport was very efficient (unlike in EU where there are long lines). "
Nice little shopping area to visit,"Myeongdong is definitely crowded as it is a tourist area. You can find just about anything you'd want to buy here from cosmetics to food. The price of the street food can add up, so don't plan on having street food for dinner unless you don't mind the cost! You can get great reals if you know how to pick your shops or if you know how to haggle with the vendors. Definitely a nice place to visit in Seoul! "
Great Lively Shopping Area,"It is easy to get to Myeong-dong by subway, there is a station right there. The streets are buzzing and you can buy just about anything!"
For all your shopping needs,"If you want to shop for clothes and cosmetics, this is the place to go. It also lined with street food stalls. You must try the different types of street food that they have to offer. It is very popular so it is often crowded. "
Shop till you drop if the streets aren't to crowded,"despite only staying 10 minute walk away from myeongdong I only seemed to be brave and go about twice during my whole 3 month long trip as i couldn't stand the constant crowds of people at all times myeongdong just seemed to be constantly busy. there never seems to be a quiet hour or quiet street. however, the shop are amazing and the amount of free samples i got just walking up and down the street was amazing i didn't even have to go in! "
Shoppings,This place is full of vigrancy. Street stalls neatly lining up the streets. Starts on after 2pm. All sorts of local Korean delicacies. Expensive though but clean and delicious. Tons of beauty shops everywhere and speaks beautiful mandarin. Simple to locate. Cannot get lost.Recommend to go early winter as it was rather hot.
Really the worst place in Seoul to spend time.,"This area is heavily populated by Chinese tourists with large suitcases who sit in shops sending photos of items to their friends on Wechat. There's street food, but nothing you can't find in a less touristy area. My advice: avoid myeongdong like the plague - There's better places in Seoul for literally everything on offer here."
Heaven for make up lovers,"Shopping at its finest! We planned to stay here for only 3-4 hours but when we went there around 1pm, we didn’t left not until it time to go back to hotel to sleep. Aside from so much to shop, from make up to souvenirs, trying out different street food will take up so much of your time. Given the chance, we could stay here all day long. And the photos will show how shopaholic we all are."
Pretty touristy but also very nice for shopping ,Myeong-dong is a pretty touristy spot but also perfect for shopping. There are department stores as well as small stalls with local food or souvenirs.The mix is pretty nice and even though it’s very crowded it’s not hectic at all.We liked it there a lot.
Best place to be at night!,"Get your street food fix at the alleys of Myeongdong. Lots of food and dessert options around. Prices can be a little bit higher as this is a touristy area. Tons of roadshop brands here, too. Don't forget to bring your passport so that you can avail of the tax refund (for a minimum single receipt purchase of 30,000 won). Also, I found that Myeongdong is the best place to exchange foreign currency. There is a currency exchange shop near the Chinese Embassy that has particulary good forex rates. From the embassy, walk 20-30 steps along Namdaemun and look for a shop located at a basement (not the one right across)."
Shopping for beauty products.,"If you are interested in beauty products, Myeondong Shopping street and the nearby streets/alleys is the place to go. However, my advise is to bargain a lot, as not all the shops has fixed prices.You can also find a lot of good restaurants in the area."
Myeongdong mania,Myeondong is just fantastic to walk around with street stalls crazy shopping of all kind. Just love it!
very crowded. lots of skincare options,"I felt a bit overwhelmed at the start.but its got everything here.definitely worth a visit, especially if you want to get skincare products"
Very deceiving!,"We took a nice hotel in this area after hearing about this ""wonderful"" shopping district. The hotels and surrounding areas are quite nice and elegant, but those shopping streets are more like a flea-market that is run mostly by Chinese... Location is still nice and central, but there is nothing particularly interesting to buy here and no decent restaurant for regular tourist. Seoul is a beautiful city and there are much better areas for tourists."
Wonderful time ,"We were in an apartment very close to the market. Very easy to access and on Friday full of life. We went on Saturday and closing at 23:00 so be careful. You can walk and smell and taste a lot of street food. Need cash for this. Everything is between 2.000 and 5.000 KRW, except the lobster 15.000 KRW.Try also the 32cms ice creams at 2.000 KRW.In one of the streets, you also have a Cat Cafe where an admission fee is required (KRW 10.000) with a drink included. It is an experience ."
Crowded but fun,"Any kind of food, shopping and nightlife you want. A must see coming to Seoul. And definitely worth the effort to get there. "
Beauty/cosmetic central ,"This place is a must see if you want to experience cosmetic/beauty shopping on Korea.The shopping streets are filled with various beauty shops, all offering 50% off or buy one get one free on skincare products, especially face masks.They even have suitcases you can buy at the till if you want to buy a lot of stuff.They all try and get you into the shop by offering you a free face mask.The face mask they give you for free, is being sold for approx 10000 won inside the shop. Once you take this mask, the shop assistants inside follow you around like a lost dog. It is a good experience, you just need to be clear as to how much you want to spend because it can get a bit out of hand as there is so much to choose from!Otherwise on the street, there are the general shops: Zara, H&M, a very cheap pharmacy, restaurants etc.Taxis are also plentiful in this area, and are very very cheap. "
a must go !,"If you're into Korean skincare, make up, fashion and snacks, you must definitely go to Myeongdong ! They have the whole area full of shops and stores."
exciting shopping centre,"being here with some friends during the time in Korea. Many shops, many tourist but the air is still clean and fresh at night. The street food is great, especially strawberry.The next time going to Korea, will be here again."
Hyper shopping?,"Hyper shopping? It was ok, but nothing that special. Nice to 'window-shop' and walk around for a bit."
Shopping spree,"We enjoy shopping and there are entertainment on the street, enjoy eating street food lobsters and other korean food"
One day is not enough,"In my view, Myeongdong is the must-visit place for the hundreds of restaurants, shops and night market stalls spread across 99 HA of land. From the exit of Myeongdong station, one must remember the route taken, not so much as not to be lost, but to explore every nick and hook of this shopping paradise in Seoul.Street food served by night market stalls is expensive but not unaffordable. This is after all a popular and famous tourist spot. One advice is not to gobble up every food that intrigues you so that you won't regret not having any more capacity for delicacies 1 hour later.The streets are straight and they criss cross one another. Many shops are duplicated selling cosmetics and skincare products, worth a buy since they are generally half the price compared to the home country of the tourists.Myeongdong - one day is definitely not enough. "
Shopping and street food!,"Good place to walk, shop and eat the street food. Feels relaxing although it was quite crowded. If u r buying the skin care and beauty products, this is better than Lotte Departmental store by far in my opinion"
Seoul,"Myeongdong is very a nice. A lot of Korean street foods , restaurant and not to mention the Shopping. "
Amazing Myeongdong,"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to Seoul, we stayed within 15 minutes walk form Myeongdong and I have to say it was fantastic! The area has all the large high end fashion boutiques and department stores (Lotte Department Store) you could ever want as well as a huge range of high street stores, some I knew some I did not. In addition to this the array of food eateries was wonderful! I have to say that hand on heart my most favorite part was the street food vendors that set up every afternoon and are there until the wee small hours. Absolutely amazing range of food to choose form and the smells as you pass the sweet and savory selections are wonderful. My son and I went there one evening to just try everything we could in place of going out for dinner. I highly recommend Tornado Potatoes and he particularly loved the Octopus and Lobster food stalls. I am going back again early next year as I had the best time!"
Busy Shopping Street,"We stayed at Namsan Guest house at Exit 3. Myeongdong Shopping Street was located at exit 6 and 7. There were many cosmetics shops like Nature republic, innnisfree and many more. We bought bundle aloe vera and masks with reasonable price. A must visit place were Artbox, Line friends and Lala Mart. We watched Nanta Show at Unesco building.The people with red shirts were there at the entrance to help you with the direction. There were many food stalls. Most of all for muslims, find the Busan Jib restaurant at the alley (trademark ABC mart and Apple signboard). We tried a lot of street food like tall ice cream, spiral potato, egg bread, gimbap and red bean fish cake."
Shopping,You can buy everything here specially facial products of Korea. They offer buy one take on or in a package. There are also restaurant around the market where you have something to eat. 
Shop til you drop,"Everything you want for skin care, make up, clothes and more!Top names as well as local bargains. Sheet masks a particular winner."
Great place to visit ,"Lights, sounds and smells will make this a memorable place to visit. Go of an evening for the full effect and make sure to sample some of the street food. See more of my adventures here by checking out @footballfoodpackaging on Instagram. "
"Great area for walking, browsing, and tasting street food!","Wow; we had the best time sampling delicious street-cart foods in this area. Great sit-down restaurant and stores there, too. If you are intimidated by crowds, this might be a bit much, but we LOVED it! Most interesting street foods included scallops grilled with cheese, grilled octopus and squid, and tasty eggs grilled inside a small toast slice."
nice night market,Situated in the centre of Seoul. The place is very good for street food. lot of shops to do household purchases and fashion products including cosmetics.
Good place for shopping,"This is a good place for shopping in Seoul City. We all know that as tourists we are looking for places where we can find a wide variety of goods to buy, and Myeongdong street is a must go for tourists. Here you will find many international and Korean clothing stores like Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Adidas and more, or if you are looking for the latest trend in Korean skincare and beauty products this is the right place for you. You might have heard how important appearance is in South Korea. Make a stop in Myeondong street and treat yourself by buying some good Korean skincare products. Here you can go into the skincare and beauty shops and you can get free samples, and if you are lucky enough the staff of these stores will let you try the products on site.In Myeongdong you can find food although. International and Korean restaurants are everywhere, but one of the most popular foods in this area is the street food. I highly recommend you to come to Myeongdong street after 4:00 pm, you will see street vendors taking their small food trucks out and you'll find them in the main street and alleys. Bring some cash with you because you won't be able to pay with your card if you want to buy their food, I think that most of the prices of the food are reasonable but I am gonna dare to say that some others look a bit expensive compared to what they are selling."
Must for shopping,"If you want skin or beauty products, this is the place to visit.Opens till 9-10 pm, lot of bargain products.Most of the brands are available."
Crowded street with tons of shopping ,"Very crowded street, full of shopping, particularly full of shops that sell beauty products, Innisfree, Clio, Etude house, skinfood, u name it they have it. When it is evening, the whole street become alive with all the street stalls set up, but personally I find it expensive. An egg bread costs 2000 won, a beef cube stock costs 7000 won, a stick with rice cake and sausage cost 4000 won. A fish cake cost 2000 won. There are also shops selling clothes, socks and accessories. You can also find theme cafe like cat cafe, also other cafes like coin cafe, osulloc tea house. There are many popular restaurants here as well, like running man haha bbq shop, wangbijib bbq as well. The underground mall at Myeongdong Station, you can also shop over there."
Shopping central,Super close to Insadong area where I was staying - constant buzz about the place and packed with clothes and cosmetics stores - also great street found around 
great to do shopping ,Provides more avenues for shoppers with garments and personal care items. Easy to move around the city. 
Very nice ,"You can found everything, from some littles markets or restaurants and the bests boutiques. It is a really cool and fun place to go shopping. "
Myeongdong street,"Everywhere is small shops for tourists, you can find anything you want. Chinese tourists everywhere.."
Great shopping,"A great place to visit, the shopping is amazing, plenty of street food to try. Recommend the chicken skewers. Movies here go in morning, only 8000 won. Got some new glasses here, ready in one day, 1/3cost of glasses in NZ. Well worth a couple of visits. Open till early morning."
Must experience the night market,"A must see and experience if you love shopping, meandering and people watching. Street food is good too!"
Great place for street food and shopping,This is a must visit! The place is packed full of street food and shopping outlets. Coffee shops of course are there so there are lots to choose from. There can be lots of people in that street and on a hot day may be uncomfy to some especially if you have a baby or a toddler. Better go there on the late afternoon so it's not too hot.
Street shopping,"Everything you could think of is here. Gives you a flavor of Korean cosmetics and street food. Busy and hot in the summer, take an umbrella. "
Must Visit!!!,This place is beautiful at night however you have to be patient and enjoying shopping at busy shopping districts otherwise it could be too much for you.Most famous cosmetic and skincare stores located here.
"very busy street, lots of food, cafes, and cheap shopping","This is a very busy street with lots of tourists. If you are new to korea, then I would suggest visiting at least once because it gives you a good idea of what busy, young areas are like in Seoul. Theres lots of options for shopping, ranging from small privately owned stores, lots of chain stores, malls, and even a more high-end department store. Try a restaurant (its a chain so you can actually find it in many neighborhoods in korea) called You ga nae (chicken galbee). all my friends loved it when I introduced it to them."
"Fun, fun, fun😁😀😃","Check it out, and you will like it! There are ton of shops, restaurants, and shops..and many more. At night, this place was so lively....small food kiosks showed up...Check it out!"
"lots of restaurants, street food, shops","very busy street with all the stuff. every evening the streets are full with street vendors, and packed with tourist. lots of restaurants, shops and cosmetic shops"
Amazing ,My favorite neighborhood during my Seoul’s visit. Lots of street food places to try Korean food. Good place to come to on your first day in Seoul. 
Shopping paradise,Just bring along cash to shop till you drop. Wonderful place to get all the Korean drama gadgets here. Most of the shops are managed by young Korean.
Fun for tourists who love to shop,"I love to shop and I gotta admit that it was really fun and exciting exploring this place in the beginning, but it got REALLY boring and repetitive after like two days because the stores were all chain stores so they just kept repeating itself... the chain stores didn’t have much variation and options either so it gets boring after looking at the same stuff all day. Also, the only deals that are worth it are the ones that are like “buy one get one free” or “buy two get one free” deals, otherwise everything else is sold at retail price and it’s not worth it. "
Heaven!,If you love skincare/cosmetics/make up here are the right place. U can buy mask at cheaper price and also I in love with the saem liptint!
Cosmetics heaven & great street food,"If you are first time in Seoul and looking to browse for some Korean cosmetics, that is where you should go! There are plenty of shops there. My advice - do not spend all money in the first one! Also, always ask for free samples if you are making a purchase. They give plenty!There are quite a few restaurants in the area, I would recommend grabbing some street though! "
Loads to do,"We love this street - especially in the evenings when the weather was cooler. There's plenty of street food - name it; it's here: whether it's chicken or octopus, steak or crepes, it just seemed to be an endless supply of food and shops. "
Superb Shopping and Street Food,Go for some excellent shopping and food. The food carts offer great variety and there are plenty of sitdown restaurants and cafes too
Great Shopping District but beware of petty thief!!,"This is a shopping heaven especially for street food, cosmetics, clothing and shoes. You will find many shops packed during Saturdays. However, we had a bad experience where we were cheated by food seller who asked us to pay twice, once during the ordering and they made us pay again when the food was prepared. We were shocked that there was such a petty ""thief"" among those sellers who use this trick to get more money from foreign visitors."
Evening delight,"Fantasic street food available after 6.00pm. Good selection of shops, streets seemed very safe and clean."
Shopping,A fantastic place to spend an evening and the church close by was beautiful.. excellent street food and fun shopping..the make up stores are so many it was sad for my husband as we three girls were going crazy
My favorite spot in Seoul!,"I'll be honest, I'm not usually a ""shopper"" on vacation but I think this street converted me. It's a haven for anything and everything you could imagine - seriously, anything you're looking for at any price range, this place has got it! I personally found myself more drawn to stationary/home goods/Korean skincare stores. Even in the intense rain that was happening during my visit, this place was a pleasure to visit. Also, if you don't try the street-food (there is a street dedicate to this) you're missing out on one of the best experiences Seoul will give you. I tried out some tteokbokki, kimbap and found an organic milk based soft serve stand and they were all heavenly."
The SoHO of Korea,"This place is probably one of the best places to shop. Uniqlo, Zara, H&M, Dr Marten, Adidas, MCM.Actually, I found a review on the Korean masks here. I went to Innisfree and discovered that their products use ingredients from Cheju -do (Cheju Island). There is a hand lotion that smells delightful (black tea) and also from Cheju-do.There’s also Nature Republic as well. Public bathrooms are on the 5th floor of the building that has Forever 21, and the basement of Caffe Bene and 1st floor of Daiso.I found another cool store called Artbox which has all sorts of cute novelties, ranging from lens to your camera, adorable umbrellas, pill boxes and masks to cover your face when you are sick.Last and a must for people who have never been to Daiso. It’s like a 99 cent store plus Sanrio store plus Bed Bath and Beyond. There are these store in Los Angeles, but tiny. This one is literally 8 floors and I checked."
BEst shopping street,"If you are looking for a cool shopping experience, go to this market area. Check beforehand for the hours as sometimes it changes. "
Crowded cosmetic heaven,"I love cosmetic, so this is heaven for me. I was there in August which was too hot n humid to shop during day time. Stores have AC but I prefer to shop at night time especially they have street food. Foods are not cheap IMO. And I am not sure if we are suppose to bargain for beauty supplies? Because I feel they are not that cheap compare to if I order online. Most store lures you with deals like buy 2 get 1 free and throw in bunch of samples. Or if you buy 500k krw they give you a small carry on, 1 million krw they give you a medium luggage to carry your purchase (I think that’s a great idea). And you see lots of people carry luggages around. I wish they have a beauty supply store where they sell beauty machine like derma pen, needle roller, LED light, etc.. .. because I couldn’t find one. Oliver young has blackhead removal machine but it is weak. I bought and tried once I got back to the State. It didn’t work well. Otherwise I highly recommend going to myeongdong shopping street."
"Bustling district, lots of cheap street food ",We loved this district on our short stay over in Seoul. The street food was to die for! It’s easily accessible by the metro.
Food and Shopping Experience ,Catering to all types of travellers! Great street food and quaint restaurants to shopping! A must place to visit in Seoul. 
An experience to remember,We booked a hotel in this area so that we can make the most out of exploring every nook and cranny of Myeongdong shopping street. There are a lot of tourists and can be overwhelming especially on weekends. But the shopkeepers are nice and there are a lot of things to see (and eat). 
Anything you are looking for you’ll find!,"Busy, lively, interesting, good bargains!You can find anything here from a hairdressers to a school books store, big brands and no brands. Total fun mix of people and shops!"
Shopping and Eaten Haven,Love love the night market. Went there every night for food and the crowds. Even saw a live drama filming and saw a famous actress. Also a place to shop especially for women who loves makeup. So a must visit in Seoul!
Myeongdong the best market to go to when in Seoul,"Too nice a place we went there everyday after lectures for SNU.The cathedral, blouses, toys, babies accesories ,food ,socks.The church is a must see as it is the first Catholic church built in Gothic style.Doota duty free with Line products for kids.Food is good esp at Migabon near the carhedral with their porridge n chicken soup."
Myeongdong Shopping Street Seoul Korea,This is really a wonderful shopping place... you get all sort of brands and bargains... Also there are many eateries to choose from... A must place to visit.. 
Must Visit in Seoul!!,"A very busy and lively area in Seoul. A must visit whenever you are in Seoul, most eatery and good food can be found here. There are plenty of cosmetics shops. Suitable for shopaholic and tourists. There are also many nice hotels around which most of them can go directly to the airport. Myeongdong can offer a vibrant part of the city!!!"
 Lots of great finds,"Shoes, clothes, skin care, toys almost everything is here x3! Many stores u wont often see in malls. "
Shoppers heaven ,If you are a shopperholic than this is the place to be. Massive in size and selling almost everything that has to do with fashion. Late afternoons are best to go 
Vibrant part of the city,"Probably our favourite part of the city, a mixture of shopping malls, shops, restaurants and street food. Plenty of free wifi hotspots from shops. Most shop assistants speak English to an extent and you can purchase tax free if you take along your passport."
Fun Shopping Area,Fun shopping in this area. Lots of cosmetics stores. Low cost clothes and shoe shops. Some fun shops for kids with toys. Lots of food vendors on the street. Inexpensive restaurants.
A lot of Korean Cosmetics Shops!!,"you can find in this place the different South Korean cosmetics brands such as innisfreeworld, etude house, nature republic, etc. and they give a lot of ""service"" which are gifts for whatever you buy such as free face masks, anti aging products and others which I use whenever I travel. There are also street food but I have not tried."
Great shoppingarea,"This is a great place to do your shopping. Especially for cosmetics. However, it is very crowded with a lot of tourists."
NICE STREET FOR A WALK & SHOPPING,This is the only STARBUCKS outlet in the world with change in language. Nice restaurant's from different countries.
A must visit place for shopaholic <3,"There is a lot of shops that offers variety things like korean cosmetics , Albums, Shoes, Clothes & many more . There is a lot of cafes & restaurants. Don't forget korean street food at night too! Shopping heaven in Seoul"
Tourist trap,"Lots of shop with cosmetics, souvenirs, Korean BBQs, etc. Very lively with thousands of Japanese and Chinese tourists. Personally quite disappointed by the place and overall not really interesting. On top of that, expensive prices. "
Must go hopping and eating place for tourists anytime during your stay,"A must-go place for tourists. On the first day, you can come here for money exchange. Many shops with better rate than other places of Seoul but the best one is still the one the opposite of the embassy, although very minor than the better one in Myeongdong. On the last day, you can do shopping for comestic or sports shoes. Anytime you can come here for food with famous restaurants. They may not be the best but are above average."
Must see,Great place to visit for shopping and dining. Try both day and night as it is a different experience.Must see!
Happening shopping heaven,"U could get almost everything you need here.A street full of shops selling cloths, masks, snacks, coffee and so much more.We spend entire day here and we still yet to finish shopping! Literally a heaven for shopaholic!Cosmetics is something you shouldn’t miss. High quality products with reasonable price."
A must see place for spending money,"Great place to kill the time and everything there looks so attractive. Nice place to shop around. Also, they have some nice restaurants nearby, just google them. "
Check discount coupons for shopping and restaurants!,"Be sure to get a map from your hotel or the tourist info guides before wading into Myeongdong. You definitely get a sense of deja vu as you see nearly the same stores every way you turn.Shopping: 1. Have a shopping list (with prices) before you go so you do not easily fall into sales traps! 2. There are discount coupons on a few Myeongdong shops and restaurants in the Visit Korea Committee site. I think the offers change regularly, and can be redeemed in specific branches. I've seen 10% off coupons on Banila Co. and Missha on the site. This is in addition to the tax refund you get once you reach the 30k won minimum. 3. The Myeongdong stores do not give out as much samples as I expected; I had to ask the cashier to give me samples as my purchase was being wrapped up. 4. Compare items/offers at the main street stores with items/offers at stores by the outskirts. By main street, I mean that road with the street food stalls that has Uniqlo at one end. I've seen discounts offered at an outskirt store that wasn't available in the main road store. I've also been allowed to choose items that went into a BuyX/GetX offer at an outskirt store, whereas the main road store only had pre-packaged bundles.5. Read up on Korea tax refunds before your visit. Check the tax refund provider of the store before going in, or if the store directly gives you a tax refund after you present your passport at the cashier. It would be most convenient if the store gives you a tax refund directly; next convenient would be if all your tax refunds would fall under a single provider such as Cube Refund, Global Blue, etc. 6. For tax refund claims less than 75,000 won, getting refunds through the airport kiosks is a pretty quick process. 7. For shopaholics, there may be better offers in the duty-free store at the airport. There is also an online duty-free store where you can have packages delivered at the airport.Street food: Our favorite was the egg bread stall! Location kept changing for the 3 nights we went there. Not all of the street food were hits: the gimbap stall was a disappointment. Bring cash with you before hitting the stalls. The first night, we looked at most of the stalls before choosing what to try, and took note of stalls where locals lined up.Restaurants: As stated, there are discount coupons on a few restaurants available online. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. We didn't encounter any lines in well-known restos, but we did come in during off-peak hours.Souvenirs: There's a stall selling character socks that would make a great souvenir!"
Busy shopping street ,"This is one the busiest shopping street in Seoul. Lots of shops selling cosmetics and restaurants. Very busy and lively area.We came in the evening, so there were a lot of street food vendors around. A good way to experience the local food."
Very Good Place to Stroll,"Shopping Street is very nice to walk around. There are many interesting shops, most of which have products not sold overseas. Restaurants are in every street with a wide variety, and have many currency exchange centres if in need of exchanging cash."
Awesome place,Big tourism trap but many goos earieries and shopping variety with street performers. Very interesting for the tourist.
Good area for shopping especially Korean Beauty Products,We love Myeongdong at night. We went there 3 times when in Seoul last July. Love to shop in this area. We can even bargain at the street seller. My kids love the street food. 
Great shopping and even better food vendors,"Myeongdong shopping street is the Mecca for cosmetic and skin care but also has all the regular shops such as Uniqlo, Nike and Forever21. The best bit has to be the food vendors who set up at 4pm every day and serve long into the night. Everything from ice cream, scallops, chicken, noodle dishes and lobster for very reasonable prices. An excellent dinner choice."
Shopping delight,This is so cool. It's a food frenzie with outdoor vendors cooking on the street. Shop til you drop here too. We went several times.
Shopping with my daughter,Great fun. We came for skin care. Make sure you research and know what you want. The sales people work on commission and are good at selling you what you don’t need. I have way more than I will be able to use this year!
all you the korean cosmetic you coud wish for,"if you are looking fo korean cosmetics, all brands are there. from high end to more mainstream. great food booths in the street; better to experiment in the evening with all the lights and the crowd."
excellent shopping,You can have good shopping experience. Almost all the branded shops are there. Street food were amazing
Shop till you drop,"A shopping area where there are lots of food stands selling dumplings, shrimp tempura, noodles etc. Can be very crowded. "
Nonstop cosmetics,"I think personally when shopping here must be smart to see promotional programs. as most of Etude's brand examples, have many stores and are located in every aisle. do not rush shopping. I have experience when cosmetic shopping in myeongdong, it turns out the price is more expensive than in the online shop. so we have to be smart in shopping"
Best Thing to do in Seoul,"Budget street shopping galore, bring cash for the food stalls. Staff are always very friendly, and you can get free things like facemarks and hand mirrors just for being a foreigner. "
Absolute Must!!!,"This place is what made me fall in love with Korea!!! It has AMAZING street food to try, lots of streets to explore, and tons of stores to explore. Myeongdong was the highlight of my trip!!"
Lots to see eat and buy,"About a 20min walk from Seoul train station or 2 subway stops. Bring good walking shoes. Lots of shops, restaurants, things to see. "
Wow your food senses,A very busy street market with a lot checking out food & other items. Little shops & restaurants dotted the streets. Get a sense of the local food etc.
very busy and exciting,if you like shopping then Myeongdong Street is the place where you must visit. even if you didn't buy any thing then you will enjoy the busy place. good for walking around and grab something to eat. many local and international brands also cosmetics
Good shopping street,A lot of shop and various food can be found in this shopping street. You have to bargain the price in some shop in order to get cheap price
"SHOP, SHOP AND SHOP","This is definitely the place for shopping and more shopping. Great for people watching and towards the evening the night street food and market stalls brings live to Myeongdong.You have gyoza, pancakes, baked eggs, lobsters, prawns, scallops on shell, Oreo churros, Middle East stall, teobukki, fruits, juices. Already our third day and cannot finish trying all the food.Cosmetic haven for Korean brands that you have never even heard off.Restaurants are aplenty too.Unbelievable!"
Shopping and street food,The street market have many Korean brand cosmetic shops and sells various local street foods. A place definitely should visit when you are in Myeongdong.
Beauty products,By far the highlight of this shopping area was being given free sample beauty products just for going into the store for a 10min browse. Bulk packs are easy to buy here and make great gifts for friends back home. There's lots of other clothing stores but they don't cater for Western sizing. A great place for people watching. Many different types of food to try. I had both the 32cm ice cream and the flower gelati from Milky Bee. The Rose flower ice cream is unmissable!!! Check out Art Box whilst you're there...it was a great shop full of everything and anything. Take your passport for instant tax refunds whilst you're here. Kpop merch available in the underground subway mall. 
K-POP fans must go,"Easy to navigate and safe to walk around. A good place for teenagers to do shopping, no matter you’re looking for cosmetic or fashion, this is a place to visit."
Exciting But Just One Visit Will Do,Street market from clothes to accessories to food to gadgets! A must visit but only once if you in Seoul. 
Messy shopping area,"This shopping area is lined with a large variety of stores, from luxury stores to snmall shops. It is impressive how many cosmetics shops are gathered in a small area."
Shopping and Street Food,"Best location to shop and shop till you drop. Also, a place to eat delicious street food. Great outing"
Paradise for beauty products shoppers ,Paradise for beauty products shoppers. With lots of different brands shops. Nice place to stroll around.
Fantastic Street Food,"We absolutely loved every bite of street food in Myeongdong! Some of the vendors had similar food items but my favorite was the cinnamon sugar filled fried pancake thing. We didn't do much shopping because we were enjoying sampling different foods, but we did go in a Cat Cafe in the area which was fun. The streets were busy with people but this was definitely one of our favorite places in Seoul."
very big market,"visit myeong dong market is must, thousand of cosmetic shops. almost all gives out samples to lure customers. loved shopping. "
Place must go when in Seoul,Busy streets with plenty shops. You can find everything you want including cosmetic and gifts. Many restaurants there which provide various local food. Also some money exchange shops give very best price for you. Don't miss it!
Utopia for fun shoppers,"If you are looking for cosmetics, trendy clothes at a bargain price, this is the place to be. There are also the latest gimmick items and shoes, t-shirt shops, etc. Oh, and the street food stands are abundant, selling variety of Korean finger foods at a very reasonable price. And, it gets very crowded at night."
Great vibe!,Awesome place to shop and find the famous cosmetic Korean products. It also offers and a variety of foods! 
Shopping and street food,Visited April 2017. Enjoyed shopping here and especially the streetfood. There were so many choices even clothes and anything they can sell in the street. There are also freebies when you buy at the shops. Make sure to check out the promos first before buying so that you get the best deal.
Nice district ,Nice district for shopping and eating...can take up an entire day if you’d like. A couple of malls in the area in addition to the more local street shopping 
Nice place to shopping and eat ,"Shopping center, whether for the cheap or cheap. Some gifts can be obtained here. Places to eat are also many choices. Easily reachable by subway or taxi."
Shopping but everyone sells the same things,"very touristy, basically every shop here sells the same things and every restaurant sells the same food, many times at the same price. "
Busy Busy,"this place was full when we walked around on a hot summer day, very nice to walk around, a lot of shops and great restaurants. Definitely enjoyed myself here, watching local koreans shop and eat at their favorite places."
Chaotic and funky smells,"My first impression was the chaos of too many people. This is to be expected, as in any other shopping street, but what was really annoying and shocking (at least to me, as a person who has been to a lot of other shopping streets) were the cars, trucks and mopeds speeding through the really narrow and crowded main street. You constantly have to look behind your shoulders to avoid being run over by 4X4 cars, because Koreans do not stop for anybody! I was excited to try some Korean food from the food stands, but I was put off by the strong sewer smell that kept hitting me everywhere in the street. Not to mention the pigeons and flies that were around the food stands, and meat just lying unprotected in the heat of the sun and out in the open. (Also, lots of Korean men hocking loogies in the street). My excitement for shopping in Myeongdong kindled away when I realized that there were at least three of the same brand stores spread around Myeongdong that sell you the exact same things. Store clerks made me feel awful and like a thief, because they followed me around. At one point I turned around to look at something, and almost knocked down the store clerk because she was literally breathing down my neck. I found it really annoying and inappropriate that people working in the stores stood in front of the them, clapping their hands in your face when you walked by, screaming and shouting trying to sell you something or give you ""free"" samples. Also, if you're (specifically a white) female, you might have old Korean men coming up to you asking for ""massages"" with their wallets out ready to pay you. Not as great as I thought it would be - as a matter of fact, very disappointing."
For the beauty and fashion lovers,"Amazing shopping street with a variety of clothing and beauty shops. In the evening the street vendors come out so you can get a taste of the delicious street foods, Korea is known for. "
Myeongdong street and area to shop and hang around !,"This is kinda street that full of stores, international and Korean brands, also some culinaries along the street. Car and motorcycle still pass this street, this is uncomfortable for visitors. The highlight for us is Line Friends store, we can shop.and take photos especially on the 2nd floor."
Shop and eat,Is very suitable for teenagers.Sell so many product of korea. And culinary (street food) also very delicious.Must try!! Trust me the price is cheaper than other
Skin care paradise ,"We were advised to shop around the Metro Hotel area. I found all sorts of new skin care products which I now use with good effect on my maturing skin. My beauty routine will never be the same. My sons bought clothes from the street sellers, and they’re of good quality. It was raining on and off and we did not stay long."
Best Tourist Place,"This is the best place for people who like shopping. There are so many stores from make-up, clothes, jewelry, bag, and even food-street. In here the brand is not just Korean brand but also International brand also available from Booths (UK cosmetic store to H&M and Zara).For the food street, bag, jewelry, and bag, they required you to pay using cash only. So please be prepare to bring your cash here. But for the make-up store they can receive payment using card and cash."
Lively area!,"Visited this area almost every night during our 8 days stay in Seoul. Lots of very nice street food, restaurants and cafes in this area. Very lively and happening especially after the sun goes down. Must visit! "
Shopping stopover,Went twice in the day and once at night..... bustling area with so many shops ..... but cater mainly for young adults and teens.Nothing interesting for older folks to browse.Food outlets are good and cheap.
"Bring cash, patience and wear tennis shoes!","I go to Myeong-dong once a year. Summer here can be brutal: crowded and extremely hot and local people are impatient and they push, shovel and spit regardless of age and gender. People here mainly for the street food and souvenir marts. I am not too sure about the street food because I walked through the whole areas noticing they are all the same - deep fried seafood (6000w/cup), grilled cheese (3000w/stick), fruit juice (4000w/cup), fried noodles, grilled shrimps (6000w/stick), & shallow fry dumplings and rick cakes, etc. During the weekends, they start setting up around 2pm. If you do not like too many crowds, go during the day.If you cannot take the crowds, you can try the restaurants in the malls on the top level (not food court) and find some peace there. Apart from the street food, restaurants on the sides of different alleys could be a good choice too but make sure you compare prices as they serve similar food.I personally do not like it too much. Its too crowded, too noisy and too dirty (from street food)."
So fun,"We loved browsing the fun things sold on the street, and the fact that it runs into the food market is a huge bonus."
SHOPPING FOR DAYS,You’ll go in here in the morning and end up leaving at night cause they’re about to close already. Time passes by quickly because shopping here is absolutely heavenly 
Lots of fun places to shop ,"Really fun to pop into the stores in this area. There are also sometimes street vendors selling food or t-shirts and colourful socks that make great souvenirs. There are also a lot of of K Beauty shops in this area, so stock up on your face masks! Try not to get lost while you are having fun shopping!"
Many many shops ,"You’ve got all your favorite cosmetic shops there, so keep an eye open and look for the best offers! They change all the time, even from one day to another so make sure to around before you make a decision to buy something! If you are a Kpop fan, there are a lot of kpop stores but kinda hidden so keep and eye open for them! (They are in basements or upper floors!)"
Lots of neon and shopping,Go at night for the most action. Street vendors in addition to the big stores. Will be crowded but a fun stroll. Lots of food options. 
The place to be for beauty-products!,"As we lived just in connection to this area, we walked those streets on a daily basis! Loads of beauty shopping.. masks, skin-care, make-up you name it! I would recomend you to read up on brands in advance and decide approximately what you are after ;). It is very easy to get ""sucked-in"" to the stores and get things sold to you that you weren't going to buy :D. No matter if you are male or female, there are masks for everything! Beard? no problem, there are solutions for that too :P. Among all beauty shops, there are plenty of food places and in the evening, the street-market-stalls comes out!"
Good for everyday walking,"We visited regularly during our trip to Seoul, almost everyday. The street food is amazing, ranging from light snacks to almost full meals. Although the crowd is huge, you don't feel like a foreigner while walking the streets due to the diversity of people and goods."
Crowded yet very entertaining,"It was Sunday when i went to this street to look for souvenir for my family and friends after i found out that Dongdaemun Market closed on Sunday.Very crowded place with tourists and locals. The food were amazing to look but if you not into Korean taste, i won't recommend you to buy or eat it. The taste might disappoint you. I love food! Love to cook too. So it was not as i expected to taste and i waste money on it. But if you just don't care about money then go ahead and buy the food streets. "
Cosmetic is the majority there,"There are many many shops there such as cosmetic, street food, clothes and so on. There are many variety of cosmetic products. My wife really enjoy her shopping there."
Great place to shop and eat,The best place to shop and eat whilst in Korea. Best experience of the nightlife in Korea too. You can get all your souvenirs from here.
"Lively shopping area, get a map","Came here specifically to look for cheap glasses, which I did not get, but it is a lively area to eat some street food and do some shopping. Before you start, get to an information office, there is one near Boots on the main street, and get a Myeongdong guide map of the area. Apart from the streets it tells you where different types of shops are, restaurants, toilets etc. They also have a Seoul Official Tourist Map, which I had not seen before, which has street maps of different tourist areas, very useful. Try and get it elsewhere at the start of your holiday if you can."
Fun place to be,"Excellent place to be with teenagers, shops catter to all tastes but mainly youngsters. Very good value cosmetics and restaurants. Definitely a must in Seoul! "
"Great food, great shops, great street stands, can't be better","If you are looking for a place with concentrated great foods, great shops, and great local street stands, then this place is for you."
Hidden treasure - Free hanbok trial,Busy place with lots of shopping for cosmetics. The Information centers offers free hanbok trial for 10 mins but you need to register upfront. 
Fun night market street,I love the crowd of fun people & all cosmetic brands that are available there. Fun place to shop & eat. Will go back again tonight
The heart beat of Seoul,"This place is so lively! Several streets lined with boutiques, skincare products, famous branded shops, restaurants, cafes, groceries, money changers, etc..... and by 2pm in the afternoon you start seeing food vendors and all sorts of products wheeling in their carts! They last till around 1 in the morning! The place is so alive! The street food is too awesome to describe! From bbq’s, kebabs, sushi’s, scallops, lobsters, etc..... this place sells the best street food in all of Asia! They are very clean! When going to Korea, Myeongdong is the place to stay! Metro is also near by."
Street food!!,The shopping is plentiful with many clothing and cosmetic stores. You can get free face mask samples if you look through the stores for a few minutes. During the day it’s pretty normal streets and stores but at night all the street food carts come out with really tasty and traditional foods for only a few dollars each. Most vendors speak English or get by with pointing. Many sit down restaurants are located on the 2nd floor or higher so don’t forget to look up. It’s very safe area and gets busy but not overly crowded. Accessible by the metro train. 
Seoul vacation,It was indeed a shopper’s paradise for cosmetic products which Korea is famous for. The small streets were a little confusing but it was fun exploring the shops. A trip to Seoul is not complete without doing any shopping in this area.
SO MUCH FOOD,This place is a foodies paradise. All of the foods that you see ppl on YouTube walking down these alleys eating are right here cooked right in front of you. And the prices are only a couple of bucks an item.
Beauty Products are everywhere,"Good destination for shopping of beauty products. Street foods are good, yummy but not that expensive as you think, :-)"
Beauty and skin products ,"This is by far the most amazing in place for shopping and window shopping skincare and beauty products.You can get there by metro and get off in the Station with the same name.You can also find restaurants and bars to go during, after or before shopping.Locals are crazy for this type of products, foreigners have a difficult time to decide whether to spend all their money thereOr not.Such a wonderful experience for men (set up a business) and women (makeup and skincare products). U can’t miss it"
Very hot but good shopping,"Visited this district during my stay. There are lots of shops underground and above ground (don’t forget to look up). There are shops for everything from clothes, pharmacies, food, banks, electronics, high-end, low-end.If you are a price conscious for clothes then go window shop in the brand name stores and then head out to the street or underground and by a similar looking style for much much less."
Major shopping time!,Great place to shop for facial masks! Lots of shops. Street stalls start to set up for business in the evening. 
Mecca for cosmetics,Has all the recent cosmetics in the shop with new and innovative products. Also had dinner in one of the famous soup places nearby.
a MUST SEE in seoul! ,"If you are visiting Seoul, take your time and visit this street! Especially in the evening. Go there hungry and taste the greatest street food of all time. Sooo many things to choose between. The only thing I can warn about is that buy anything from the little street sellers.. too expensive for Koreas street selling "
You have to see this area,"There is an obscene amount of skin care stores, which is kind of obnoxious. That said, there are a zillion things going on and a lot of interesting things to see. You could certainly be occupied here for hours just people watching. I like it and will probably go back. There is a small concentration of obnoxious religious zealots with megaphones, and pushing pamphlets on you. They seemed kind of concentrated to a certain area, so it's not an overall issue. "
Bustling,Really bustling street .. you can find just about everything here. The street food is amazing but you need to to be there after 5pm .. that’s when all the street food vendors start operating.
K-products shopping spree,"Get yourself a map before you explore the place as it is VERY BIG and can be quite confusing and daunting for first timers. You can find almost every brand possible here, with one brand has several stores spread in every junction.Great place to look for cheap clothes on their outlets, too. Visit the LINE friends store to take a picture with giant Brown.There are some street food stalls and restaurants. The recommended one is Myeongdong Gyoza with their famous guksu (noodles) and, obviously, gyoza."
heaven!,umpteenth times here and i am still not satisfied haha u definitely can bargain more if u know more korean and if u buy a lot! #makeupheaven #skincareheaven
Great base ,Stayed at Myeongdong both 2 years ago and on our last trip. It's a great base to be as it's so lively and happening. There are also a few exchange places so very convenient. I am not big on shopping so wasn't interested in the cosmetic shops and the street food is quite samey and overpriced. The best thing about it is the vibe and convenience in getting to other places- the cable car to Namsan park is not too far away and it's a short walk to Namdaemun. It was nice to step out of our guesthouses and step straight into the energy of the area!
Best shopping and street food ,"This is a place to go for cosmetics. Huge variety of street food stalls, don't miss tempura shrimp. Lots of fashion shops and restaurants. "
South Korea Vacation ,Stayed in area. Very fun and interesting. Lots of different shops and restaurants in walking distance. Convenient for airport shuttle and subway. 
Have fun and get lost,"You can shop here day or night, fashion, name brand Korean cosmetic, shoes, plus many other surprise things to find, if you get hungry, there are many street food stands here, grill lobster tails, grill scallop, bar-b-que beef and shrimp on a stick, fresh fruits and juice, plus many other goodies to enjoy, to shop and to eat or just looking, sure be a fun evening to experience."
Omg so much shopping! ,"So many stores! Lots of skincare/cosmetics stores, jewelry, cheap clothing, knock off designer goods, souvenirs and tons of street food and restaurants. Still active at 11pm."
"Shopping in day, eating at night ",After 4:00pm a lot of street food stands will be open and you can enjoy different types of Korean food. Shopping at Myeongdon is also very convenient. 
heaven for cosmetics lovers,"so many cosmetics store (mostly korean brand), like innisfree, etude house, nature republic, holikaholika, tonymoly, and many more, and every brand has more than 1 store so if you found that the product is sold out in one store, you can try to find it in another store. overall the beauty advisors are helpful, esp in Lush store, they spoke english fluently.In myeongdong u can find not only cosmetics, but also restaurants and street food. the street is clean and at the most of time is crowded, especially at night"
Your search for Cosmetics ends here!,"Cosmetics, cosmetics everywhere on this street. Great place for sampling cosmetics and getting great deals and discounts on cosmetics.In the evenings, this place lights up and offers a variety of street food options, which are a must try.There is also an undergrund market here, which also is quite good.Moreover, the best part is that you can claim your tax free refunds right here, as the office is located inside BOOTS Pharmacy on this main street.Overall, a must visit place in Seoul"
Best shopping area,SHOPPED and bought soooooo much korean products that we had to send a 50kg parcel back to SG from Seoul. Amazing place to shop till you drop! Lots of quaint cafes and street food! 
Shopping delight,"A variety of small shops as well large retail shops the likes of Zara, H&M, Spao, Uniqlo, Forever 21. interspersed between them are food and market stalls. You can choose from a variety of cheap as well expensive stuff. A whole galore of cosmetics shops selling good quality korean cosmetics.Lots of restaurants offering authentic korean foods - BBQ, bibimbap, Galbi, Gimbap and many enticing looking foods at reasonable price. Easy to get to - Myeodong station on the blue line. Nearby departmental store Lotte is just across the road. You can also walk to the nearby Namdaemun market which is about 25-30 mins away. You can a whole day there and still have more to shop the next day."
Sugar Spice and Everything Nice!," Here, even if you pass by the store the salesperson will give you 1 face mask or free facial product sample. I was actually not intended to purchase skincare. But, end up I got offered at Holika Holika for a good price for caviar facial set. Tips to bargain, remember to ask for promotion as they don't tell you unless you ask Street foods are generally clean, reasonable and delicious. It's a vibrant place especially at night. BTW, before we hit the shopping heaven I managed to stop by at the cathedral for prayer."
Great shopping and eat,"We came here twice. 1 in the afternoon and once in the evening. It is much livelier and fun to go evening after 5pm. The stalls are fully opened and yes there are crowds but thats what makes a night market special. I was travelling with a 4yo with stroller and I can still move around comfortably. And that was on friday night. Managed to get some muslim friendly and halal street foods. Also some good bargains for skin cares, shoes and clothes for the teens girls. We spent a few hours here shopping. About same price a Bugis St in spore. We got jeans at $16 or so. The lobster tail was 15,000won per oc was so WORTH IT. Give it a try once. The Cheesy scallop was 10,000won but lobster was better! I love the fried cheese which was mildly sweet. The 32cm ice-cream was 2000won each. Some say its icy but it was good as not too sweet not creamy. Great place :)"
Shop til you drop,"Myeongdong is where you want to shop when in S. Korea, there are alot of good stuff you can buy for a reasonable price. What I really love about this place, aside from the variety of things it offers, is the freebies most specifically beauty products."
Lively shopping paradise,"Traveled June 2018. Great street food, but expensive. It's cheaper to eat in the restaurants. Some stores have salespeople in front of the store to encourage you to come in. Don't take the things they hand out unless you plan to shop in the store and it's not free. It's good to learn the phrase ""I'm just browsing"" in Korean so the salespeople will leave you alone when you're in the store instead of aggressively trying to sell you things. Korean salespeople are quite aggressive. They'll pounce on you as soon as you glance at an item. The cosmetics are cheaper at the airport, but not all items are available at the airport. The street vendors don't come out until after 4PM. Much livelier at night. Bought prescription eyeglasses and frames at Kaist Optical. For transition glasses with protective coatings and frames, it was $190. The eye exam isn't as thorough as the U.S. but if you don't have major eye problems, it seems sufficient. My son has a heavy prescription with astigmatism. Much lighter frames than U.S. frames. Cheaper than Costco in the U.S. The savings are from the frames and free eye exam. The lens is the same as Costco. Milky Bee and 32cm ice cream was only good for pictures. They're icy, not creamy. I liked the Dragon's beard candy. It wasn't as sweet as american candy. What I liked about Korean fried chicken is the sauce and crispiness."
shopping and eating,"This place is wall to wall cosmetics and beauty stores, a big line store is there and also shoe stores and restaurants,the place tend to be crowded at night less people on the day time.. a good place to visit for the experience "
The Orchard Road of Seoul,"As the name suggests, this place is a shopping street that is very happening day or night. Numerous places for shopping as well as dining options from street food to restaurants. Highly recommended!"
korean crowd,"Lots of cosmetics, and street food. Street food is very very interesting though but its a bit pricey for street food."
Good food,"So many choices of food here. A good options for halal food too...Since we're on budget, this was the place we spent our money on rather than a good restaurant. There are a lot of shopping mall around too..."
Shopping belt but quite disorganised,Overcrowding shopping belt and signages quite poor. Not much resting place for people to sit after tiring shopping. Not much shades and hot especially in summer.
Cosmetics paradise,"If you like face products this is the place for you. Basically the same stores show up on every block, it is amazing they can keep all the stores in business in such a small area. Food carts come out in the late afternoon."
night market a must-visit Seoul experience,"Lots of stores and restaurants in this area ranging from local brands to international mid-tier. Street food is a bit pricey, but good variety and small portions so you can try a lot."
Great place to visit,"Cosmetics haven for the interested. Many roadside stalls selling street food, bags, accessories etc. Many restaurants and cafes too. Isaac toast and Nanta theater nearby. A great place to hang out and chill if you like crowds."
Endless shopping,"If you have never been to Seoul, Myeongdong is probably the most happening shopping street you should go to. Getting there is easy by subway, and you could make your way out of the station from exit 5-7. Exit 5-6 is where Shinsegae dept store is and it will lead you to the walking streets in Myeongdong as well. Along the streets, there are many beauty brands, sports brand, fashion labels as well as accessories shops. The shopping is endless and after awhile, you probably noticed that there are more than 1 shop for each beauty labels at different parts of Myeongdong. So if you cannot get what you want at 1 shop, move on, you probably see the same brand again later. There are also many food options, and by late noon, hawkers will start setting up their mobile food stalls along the streets. Saw cheese lobsters going for 15,000 won, which i think is overpriced. There were roasted chestnuts stall, king prawns stall and fishcake stall as well. Actually, Myeongdong is connected to Namdaemun market. In the past when I visited Seoul, I used to walk through Namdaemum market to Myeongdong and things at Namdaemum is slightly cheaper than Myeongdong. For those who have alot of time on hand, try walking from Namdaemum to Myeongdong for a better shopping experience. "
Beautiful street with lots of shops for every taste,Very crowded but amazing and a must do in Seoul.you will definitely enjoy especially at night.also a very good place to test the various foods and beautifully designed fruit trolies. There are also some skin care stores where you can buy face masks with reasonable prices and bonus gifts.
You will never be hungry ,"Lotsa and lotsa of street food. However I find that sales staff from those mask shops are a little rude. They like to give you free mask to entice you to come into their shop. However, if you decide not to walk in, some of them actually curse you( I am assuming from their tone and body language). After a few incidents, i refused to accept any free masks given unless it’s a shop I want to check out. "
Coming back tomorrow,"While walking to our dinner, we passed by. Had some grill lobster, eggs cake, boiled top shell, grilled squid, Oreo churros, orange just before we even reached the restaurant. The girls has so much fun shopping that we vowed to come back tomorrow. It’s so vibrant even on a weekday!"
Shop till you drop!,"They say that Korea is known for their cosmetics and that anyone visiting Korea should pop by the area for some serious shopping!Indeed, I spent quite a fair bit of money on masks and other products. Other than that, theres a lot of good food available in Myeongdong area! Street snacks too!You may/ may not find your way around easily but every area has its own beauty!Definitely a place where you can shop and eat till you drop!"
Shopping & eating,This street is bustling with activities from morning till night! If u like Korean Street food and shopping this is a good place to go. Try strawberry mochii & the tornado potato. The things are not that cheap though. There is a cat cafe there and many restaurants to try too!
Shopping,"Great shopping and delicious street food worth trying; lobster cheese, ice cream honey, cheesy fried rice etc etc"
Good food and shopping with great cafes ,Great places for foodies. Looks of places to shop and eat. Price are not cheap. Good atmosphere and super crowed 
The tourist quintessential.,"The tourist must-go on their visits to Seoul to get their cheap makeup and skincare. GO CRAZY OVER THERE!Pretty good with bustling crowds - adds to the atmosphere. Street food carts pretty expensive. Do not recommend you getting food from there, don’t be lazy, use your GPS and take a short walk over to Namdaemun market for cheaper and authentic Korean food (daaaamn those dumplings, hotteok and bibimbaps)"
Worth a visit,"A lot of food vendors at night. Great for shopping, H&M, Forever 21, Adidas, a lot of stores for beauty product (which stay open very late). Couple of bars around. Overall a chill place to walk around and taste the different foods and do a little shopping. "
Must see and do,"True, there is nothing that sets this shopping street apart from any other in Asia, but I had nice strolls at different times of day. The street food was tasty, I felt safe, and enjoyed watching the people. I treated myself to some Korean lipstick as cosmetics are all the rage. You can find almost anything there and in every price point all around this area."
Lively and exciting street,I walked downtown through Seoul and ended up in the smallest but most interesting street in the city. A great way to finish my trip after a long day of meetings. Lots of people. Lights. Energy. Food. Shopping. It will be my first stop next time.
Relax n Enjoyable shopping n coffee in Garosugil,"This is located at station Sinsa (subway line3) exit #8 - go straight until you get to Dosandaero 13gil and J tower(very high building) will be opposite side in front of you- take Dosandaero 13gil which is Garosugil Where is less crowded and lots of nice shop (local, chain, highend).Loads of restaurants, rooftop cafes! We can spend whole day there. "
Crowded Street Market with many Fake items,"This is a fun market to visit, however the prices need to be negotiated. They tend to be a bit high for fakes, but still worth a visit"
Best cosmetics delas for you ladies,"very animated open air market and shops along the small streets. Sportswear, cosmetics, food and otehr attractions are there. Music and free wifi almost everywhere. Recommended for good deals and discounts. "
For young generation,One of the popular place in Korea. Before I also consider to stay here but in the end stay another place. The card cannot get in to this business street. There's some hotel are just right upstairs of the shop it really look like very convenience for those traveler. Might be I will stay in that hotel next time when I visit Korea.
Great street food,"About shopping, it's a typical shopping street with typical fashion shops. However, there are a lot of food stalls with delicious street food as well as restaurant with local food. Highly recommend to come here for eating instead of shopping"
A to Z,Though i was told it was only for electronics .. i foujd almost all i meeded here.. from electronics to cosmetics to food ..
Great for sightseeing and to try korean street food!,"A great place to experience one of Seoul busiest tourist spot, you must try the night street food here. This place is also the center of korean make up and skin care, but I don't recommend you to buy them because it is more expensive than other places. If you want to find cheaper make up and skin care, go to express bus terminal station or Ewha Univ. Station!"
Clothing stores and lots of skincare stores,"The place is huge with lots of skincare stores. It is almost a one stop place for whatever skincare products that you are looking for. You can find the same brand in every corner and if you miss one, not to worry, you will find another one just round the next corner. To get good bargains, it is probably better to go during weekends as it seems to have more good bargains such as 1 + 1 or 2 plus 2. One tip is to if to their main store as you can find better bargains. One gets easily lost in the maze of shops. It will be good to identify a few landmarks to help you get your way around. At around four to five, there will be street stalls selling various food."
Vibrantly chaotic ,"- it was only 13mins walk from our hotel- it was vibrantly colorful but a bit chaotic as when we were there some campaign for elections was ongoing with so loud speakers - the street shopping was a bit expensive as a simple shirt will costs a minimum of krw8,000 or about usd8, even the street food costs a minimum of krw3,000 for sweet potato Anyway we enjoyed strolling around as it’s very lively especially at night "
Shoppers heaven 😁,"If you are looking for a good place to spend the money, here is a must! Long walking street packed with shops, restaurants and vendor's carts. Lotte department store also located at the same area. Totally recommended to wander around even window shopping "
Great shopping trip,"This place is what i have in mind when I visit shopping street. Lots of shops shouting for attention, lots of street food. Yet there is still sufficient space to stand and look at what is for sale."
Shopping experience,"If youre looking for cosmetics and street food, then, this is the place that you should visit.Lots of stores are open until 11pm and food stalls offering wide range of food types: lobsters, steak, ice cream, dumpling, churros and so much more. I recommend to try the lobster. A bit expensive but tastes sooooo good For the shopping part, most stores give small freebies such as face masks, facial cream. You get a little something even if you dont buy anything "
Lively area,"Like any other big city, the shopping district can be a rather interesting experience and the Myeongdong area in Seoul is not different. In my opinion, this is nothing special - there's a ton of people and stores selling everything between heaven and earth, most of which seem like rubbish quality. In terms of safety, Korea in general is a plus. Not at one time, did we fear anything and even when crowded, it's a safe place. "
very pleasent street,I love this place it was so lively. with ppl and it had every thing you can ever ask for in a place like this. food is great. shops has a lot variety. a really pleasant place
Eat and Shop,Its a nice area to be there especially in the evening when the weather is cool. The place is busy and there is alot of people. There are many street stalls selling a variety of food and its nice. There are also a lot of shops to do your shopping and restaurants to eat.
Brole Market :-)))),"Like to lose myself in that crazy market :-))))You can find everything you want as little presents, souvenirs..."
Touristy but Variety ,Def stop in to grab your Korean skincare (Ennis Free) but no reason to hang out unless the street food vendors are set up.
Free trade takes hold!,"I have been to multiple international shopping zones in my 50+ years of traveling... this is incredible for the diversity of vendors, bargains, and products.. the ability to negotiate is crucial to having an awesome time... this is your prime location in South Korea make sure your shoes are comfortable and that you are prepared for wonderful options.."
Shopping heaven!,"Countless shops! Tourists, please bring along your passport and you get a refund right away. There's uniqlo and daiso in addition to your popular korean brands such as Innisfree, Etude house and laneige. Across the road there is Lotte duty free department store."
A must!,My husband and I decided to stay in Myeongdong and we loved it. At night the streets are full of street food and the shops open till late. Best place to shop for cosmetics and face products. A few of the shops are actually tax free too.Do not forget to buy the cute Korean socks for cheap. I also enjoyed the Korean fried chicken street where you have a range of chain restaurants specialised only in Korean fried chicken and beer. 
Every thing for sale,Very exciting place to visit take your time lots of shopping malls but do take time to look around the back streets this is the best part. 
"Loads of beauty products, shopping and streetside food","My 2nd time in Seoul and Myeongdong is still a very busy and crowded shopping street. You can find many beauty products here and they are cheap! Look for this one shop that sells all brands, it is cheaper than most places! "
Lots to shop and eat,Myeong-Dong becomes really crowded and busy at night. So much to see and eat. Prices aren’t exactly cheap and not everything you see is delicious. You can’t go wrong with the desserts and the takoyaki balls but the egg toast and gimbap aren’t that delicious.So many Korean beauty and skincare shops. Many are repeated. I didn’t enjoy people trying to give me ‘free’ face masks. Some can be quite aggressive. Don’t take them unless you want to go into the shop to buy.
Our frequented shopping place,"Been to other Asian countries for cheap street shopping but Myeongdong is one of the shopping areas that you would always want to go back. Here you would find several good finds for cosmetics, accessories, clothes, bags, toys, Korea merchandise, etc. Along the streets you will also be tempted to try different kinds of street foods and drinks. The area also have several restaurants, coffee shops and dessert places. Some shops close at 10pm while the rest closes at 11pm so better go there early night time. Our family went there for about 4 times in our 6-days in Korea and we still can't get enough."
Nice street at night,A place you need to go while visiting Seoul. It looks like things at starting in the afternoon and end very late at night. Eating in the street is the sport here. 
Good street to shop cosmetics,Lots of cosmetics store along the street good for women to shop. And at night time lots of food vendor with good food to try. 
A place to shop,"My favorite shopping place, but if you want a dress better try to buy from underground shopping centre it is much cheaper. We were new at this place we bought one dress from the first shop we saw and found out it was quite expensive than other shops. There are a lot of free mask samples in beauty shop products like etude house which i think they have 3 or more shops here. We tried many street foods here from ice cream, lobster, steaks and many more. If you dont like spending a lot dont go here hehehe."
Bustling street with lots of shopping and street food,"A must visit in Seoul! These narrow streets are packed with tons and tons of cosmetic & skin care stores, clothes stores and street food. It seemed endless and it's easy to spend one whole day just wonder around this area. Pro tip: there are a lot of hidden away gem above the ground floor shops, so look closely! "
Street food and shopping heaven,"Lots of interesting street food ranging from Turkish ice cream to all sorts of Korean delicacies, the while Myeongdong area is a street food and shopping paradise (particularly for the ladies interested inKorean cosmetics). Very busy till after eleven but still manageable crowds in early June; could imagine things getting a bit out of hand at peak season or when Chinese tourists return in force. Spent a couple of enjoyable evenings there!"
Love it,"Must visit for all beauty lovers. Even if you're not interested in the cosmetics/skincare, visit if you have the time just to soak in the ambience. Would say beauty products are cheapest here, often with masks going for Buy 1 get 1 or Buy 2 get 1 with lots of freebies!!! Nice street food though I'd say they can get a little overpriced... Come with umbrella because when it rains, there is no shelter besides the shops."
What a Fun Place!,"There is a total diversity of shops and people in/on this street in Seoul. The heartbeat of Seoul is very evident there. We visited in the daytime and then the following evening. So many people, just happy to be there...as were we. The pulse can definitely be felt."
"Lots of things to see, buy and eat",The shopping area is not too large and is manageable. Take a slow walk in the morning as some shops open as early as 8 am. There are plenty of good restaurants here and after 6pm there are also many street hawker serving delicious food. Fruits sold at the fruit stall here may not be fresh so I would rather get it from the supermarket. Other than that non appetite and happy shopping!
Bags of Beauty,"This street is not only for women but also for men who loves skin care products at a good price. Make sure to bring a large bag for convenience of carrying your products. Tip for first timers: Tax refund is available for purchases KRW30,000 and up. So cut the retail mentality for a moment and buy all the products you need at a single receipt.Some stores deduct the tax on the purchase but some give you a special receipt which you can encash at the airport. Credit cards are accepted. You have the option to buy in your local currency or in KRW.There's forex fee if you ask them to charge you other than KRW so buy in KRW and let your local card to the conversion . Some stores are hard to find like 3CE and Labiotte but with Google map it's easy(Just like playing Pokemon Go). Street foods are also a must try.Prices are reasonable. I like the hotcake w/sunnysideup eggCosRx,Klairs and other known products can be found at a special shop ALAND. RTW outlets like Uniqlo, Adidas and Nike are present. If you're into socks there's a large store where you can buy everything at KRW1,000each or 11pcs for KRW10,000(it's somewhere at hidden corner ). Cute stickers and stationery are inARTBOX at a good price "
Popular Street For First Timers,"It is still popular to be mentioned for all 1st timers to Seoul. The area (Myeongdong 8-gil) fill with cosmetic products, accessories and local street food. The food stalls will starts at 5pm and if tourists reach there earlier, one can walk to MyeongDong Cathedral for some nice photo taking of Korean Catholic Church which located up the hillside (less than 7mins). "
Lively Street Day and Night,This is the Seoul version of Ximending in Taiwan.Streets full of people night or day. Plenty to see and shop but prices are pricier here at this touristy place. Vibes are good and exciting full of young people and tourists.
Great location!,"Famously known for good shopping, all the good brands are here, along with smaller market stalls and unique places like gun ranges or cat cafes to keep you entertained. Be cautious when on your own, I had a man approach me asking for ""donations"" for a hospital he worked at, and when I said no, he and someone sitting next to me got up and walked away together. Otherwise good food, a LOT of skincare and massage places, and a nice vibe. The Namba theatre is also here which I would 100% recommend going to if you're in the area. "
Street food craze,"Lots and lots of street food. Loved the lobster, pork skewer, kimbap, octopus ball. Did not like the s’mores. Trying to hard to copy Dominique Ansel and it’s not cheap!! Very difficult to find rubbish bin in this area but each designated shop has their own rubbish bin. "
Great dining place & interesting stalls ,"A variety of street food to feast on. Simply too many beauty shops to choose from...giving out free sample of masks etc are some means of attracting customers to go to their shops. There are also stalls & shops selling interesting stuff like socks, clothes, souvenirs etc. Love the dining there..so many restaurants & cafes with nice food. "
Shopping in the local economy,"This is a must if you want to experience shopping for gifts for friends and family. So many different stores and vendors. However, put on some comfortable walking shoes. Glad I did. Ended up waking about 3.5 miles, but worth it! Also, price compare, cause some items will be cheaper in some stores or vendors. Also they have some really cool traditional street shows with traditional dancing in traditional attire. Other fun places are the tea houses. Enjoy!!!"
Overpriced food at a tourist spot,"We spent one evening here, had shaved ice and some street food. Shaved ice was KRW 7900, a simple toast KRW 4500. Some simple chicken skewers KRW 3000 and cheese sausages KRW 4000. Fried idon KRW 5000. Small miserable portion. Didn't buy any beauty products or any souvenirs. We came here a day before our departure, because everyone says you haven't been to Seoul if you don't go to myeongdong. Nah, I wouldn't return to this area again if I'm back in Seoul. "
"Interesting, busy, great street food","We stayed in Myeongdong for our week in Seoul. Gull of action day and night. After exploring many other parts of this huge city we’re pleased we made Myeongdong our base. Very busy Fridays and Saturdays. Well worth trying some of the amazing street food vendors. Great fun, good memories from spending time in this part of Seoul."
Nice area,It could be a nice area to hangout so many shop especially cosmetic If you’re are fan of skin care you’re on a right place 
Fire!,"This was day 3 of our famtour - the place is a shop a holics’ paradise! So many shops and stalls where you can buy practically anything and everything! Just our luck, we suddenly heard sirens and firetrucks coming our way, theres a fire on one if the restaurants! I counted 5 firetrucks making there way to the very busy and crowded streets. Good thing the people did not panic. The fire was out quicks and with no casualty. "
Another memorable place to visit in Seoul,"This is one of those must visit places in Seoul. There is a variety of street food and other stalls, as well as an overwhelming array of cosmetics. Surely a great temptation for all"
Wide variety of items,There's so many beauty products you can see in every corner of the shopping street. There's also a nice selection of clothes and shoes.
Overrated area,"There are a lot of cosmetic shops opened by Chinese, which might not be selling authentic products. Most of the time, the price is slightly lower than the authentic products, while the quality is not on par. Thus, the best place to shop is still the duty free area, instead of the shopping street."
Nice to walk,When you walk around in seoul it is advice to pass by this street! It's crowed and nice but still fun for a walk. 
Shop till you drop for Korean cosmetics,"Myeong dong is where you could get all the K-beauty products, then after tired of shopping, around 5 pm all the street food and some clothes vendors will start lining up on the main street. Nice to see all is happening in one place! The shop staff could be quite pushy offering free mask to get you to their store and buy stuff. Some of food vendors not happy if you just take pictures without buying. "
So much fun ,We love this place myself I been here so many time good place to shop and eat street food ! The price is good but remember you pay what you got for ok !! This place day or night the same attraction with a lot of local and tourists walk and shopping!! You will be there in June 5 can’t wait! 
The perfect place for K-Beauty lovers,"If you are looking for Korean makeup and skincare this is the place to go. It is reasonably priced and chances are, if you can't find what you are looking for in one store then you can walk around and find it in another. It is located conveniently close to the station and there are usually food vendors around if you get hungry. You should aim to go early as it can get busy in the middle of the day. Would recommend to anyone with an interest in K-Beauty."
Makeup & skincare shopping,"Myeongdong shopping centre is convenient to access, because it's close to the station, korean makeup and skincare are everywhere. "
A good shopping center in Seoul...,"If you enjoy shopping a lot surely this place will be your first destination. Aside from this, you can also explore Korean street food during afternoon and appreciate korean its unique taste that savors your day!!!"
"Came for the shopping, stayed for the food","My wife insisted, ""There will be skin care products!"" And there were. If you're in the market for cosmetics, clothes, and the full Korean 10-step skin care routine, you cannot miss out on Myeongdong. Although quiet during the day, the place really comes alive from early evening. It's not too expensive either - you can definitely get some good deals, some which are announced loudly by trendy salespeople standing outside their designated shops.If you're not looking for a new concealer, maybe you're like me and looking for some good food - luckily, the street has a lot of this as well! There are many street food vendors with delicious food, whether you want spicy chicken, fried octopus, tasty ice cream, sticky strawberry mochi, or something else. There are also a lot of restaurants down the side alleys, but since a lot of these will only be advertised in Korean, my advice is to do your research from home and have a few noted down before going. Else you might just end up living on street food. Which, to be fair, is not a bad way to end the night. It's good, and it's cheap."
Main outdoor shopping are of Seoul,Many shops located in a maze of streets and side streets. Lots of outdoor food stalls. A wide selection of stores and eating places
Variety of food but crowded,"There are dozens of stalls selling several food items. While the quality varies it's nice to try several items. Furthermore, there are about a million stores selling cosmetics and clothes. It's crowded at night and especially on weekends."
"Crowded on weekends, less busy week ights","Fun for everyone but make sure you that together as easy to get lost in the crowd. Shop after shop of clothes or cosmetics. Don’t forget to pick up your goodies here! Every shop almost gives out free samples upon purchase and some of the deals are REALLY GOOD.Then there’s the street food. The street is lined with food carts selling mocha, strawberries, ice cream, sushi, grilled meats and seafood and other yummy items. there’s also big brands like Zara, H&M, ABC mart, Boots and uniqlo. Definitely worthwhile to spend a few hours here to get all the shopping done!"
Good place ,Cheap place to shop just like Namdaemun Market . I love the area. You can find fake designer stuffs here. Lotsof cheap stuffs. 
Cosmetics Paradise!,"If Ciosmetics is your thing dont miss this area. A huge trange at very affordable prices and most places will throw in some sample material on top of your purchase. However, dont be swayed by each store telling you that their product is best. Do your research first. Also, try to avoid visiting on a weekend due to massive crowds. It is much quieter on weekdays."
Awsome street with amazing food,"A lot of amazing and tasty street food there, in every single corner of Myeongdong. You should try some, especially the original fish ice cream. The night market will be more crowded, so be careful with your belongings. "
Skin care Shopping ,"Myeongdong is the best place to shop, a lot of skin care brands are located here, many good food also available along the street. Nearby shopping area u can find 2 department store (lotte and shinsegae), that have duty free inside too. Easy to shop when u stay in this area."
Go Shopping,"Nice place to enjoy street food, fruit juice, ice cream and lot more along with your shopping. Place is full of cosmetic shops. Enjoy !"
Great traditional food options,"Spend a few days in Seoul, lots to do and Myeongdong district should definitely be on your list of to-do’sThe food stalls stay till late and offer a great variety of traditional items over and above the many restaurants scattered all over the area. I would recommend to rather snack from the various stalls as opposed to filling up in one stop - you will regret if you did as you walk along!A few great rooftop bars around as well. "
Street Food at its best,"I was staying at Courtyard Marriott Namdaemun (see my review for the hotel). It was a 15 minute walk to Myendong. It is a very inetersting market with lots of shops, specially a lot of skin and make up products for women.What amazed me was all the variety of street food. I tried a few and they were all delicious. I highly recommend strolling through this great shopping area and be adventurous and try some of the street foods. You will be surprised.You can also take Subway line 4 to Myendong Station, snd the market is steps awayAlso Walk 15 minutes to Namdaemun Market for super Cheap stuff."
Shopping spree for makeup and skincare,"If you’re a fan of Korean makeup and skincare, make sure to set at least half a day aside to shop along Myeongdong street. Various brands like Innisfree, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Banila Co. and more can be found. Though the stores repeat, the prices are the same and all the stores offer immediate tax refunds upon spending a certain amount. Combine your purchase together with friends to get more refunds."
I'm not much of a shopper,"I don't like to shop much but this place is massive and pretty interesting. It has a bit for everyone....but then again that's what most shopping areas cater to ya? I guess you've got to come at least once. Especially for tourists. It is VERY touristy, but hey - I'm a tourist so let it be!There are quite a bit of food places around for you to indulge. Street food on the whole is not very attractive in terms of pricing to me compared to Taipei, this place is a rip off. But we're not in Taipei are we? Transport wise it's very accessible. Metro, buses or cab - take your pick. We had a hotel shuttle that operates in this area so it was even easier."
Good place to shop but there are lots of places with better experience,"Myeongdong is known to be the top tourist destination for makeup and skin care shopping, but I think because of the fame, a lot of shops doesn't treat the tourists right. Often times I got someone reached my hand, handed me a sample I tried to refuse, and pull me inside their store, it's hard to resist. I'm getting better at saying no as time passes, but still, not a really good experience. Price wise, I don't think it'll be any different to any other chain store those brands have. Also their street food is like, super expensive compared to any other places. I suggest to just go to Sinchon or Hongdae for a better shopping and hangout experience. Unless you're in a tour group, or you're coming with a big party, probably Myeongdong will be the wisest choice, because at least, it's English friendly."
Shopping,"This the place with the product so cheap!! For foreign like me, i love it so much! I can find all of skincare that i want"
Best Food in Seoul!!,"This place is seriously one of the best things in Seoul. All the shops and the hustle-bustle feel to the place is contrasted nicely with the nice quiet Cathedral in the back corner. Make sure to come hungry, the street food here is the best and most unique stuff you’ll find, plus it’s CHEAP! Great for vegans, and vegetarians"
Lively street!,"Definitely a place to go for food and shopping, the street have alot variety of food, good mix of retail shop."
Unpleasant experience,"I had good experience when I visited Myeondong 2 years ago. This time, I re-visited this shopping street and was totally disgusted and disappointed! The shop staff were hostile and rude. Their customer service were bad too, especially when I asked for more of the same items. They were so unwilling to get the products which I wanted to buy and simply threw them into the basket I'm holding. Terrible service! Even the street stalls also with the similar attitude, and worse! I was choosing some items and the owner simply asked me not to touch it and chased me away! Goodness, I wanted to buy the items yet being chased away! My friend had the same experience too when she asked for new pair of earrings she wanted to buy from a shop and the staff don't even bother to look for it and told my friend that was the last piece. But when we return the very next day wanting to get some more earrings, we saw the same pair my friend bought displayed on the shelf! Will never buy stuff from those shops and from the street stalls again! Terrible experience and shun us away."
Good Mix,"This street has a good mix of retail stores, marts, restaurants, cafes and street food carts. A must go to place when in Seoul. "
Ready to shopping ,"Spare your money here! I love myeongdong! Cosmetic & skin care shop list never end. If you looking for COSRX & klairs go to Aland shop and for tax refund go to Wonder Place shop level 3, nearby Aland. Other brand like Uniqlo, Fila, spao and the list goes on. Happy shopping!"
Korea trip,"When I was in Korea I went to Myeongdong it was around 4 pm and the street vendors were starting to set up. There was a lot of food, makeup and clothing stores. The food and clothes were relatively cheap, however the makeup could get a little expensive. Be prepared to walk nonstop."
Action Packed,"We stayed at the Hotel28, which was perfect if you want immediate exposure to Myeongdong District. This is a very large, active shopping area with many street vendors offering freshly fried potato chips, shrimp, sausage, pastries, etc. While we here, we had the unfortunate timing of extremely cold weather (0 degrees F or -18 C); however, the markets were always packed. Wherever we went, the streets here (and all over Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean."
Excellent shopping for cosmetics & fashion ,Visited the shopping street where myriads of cosmetic items and fashion trend wear are available. My only challenge is the non English speaking sales people and the description of items only in Korean. 
"Good for street food, less good for shopping to me ",Great street food (although not cheap at all because Korea is not a cheap country) but a bit disappointing for shopping as it misses variety and value for money overall. Worth doing for sure for the nice atmosphere. 
Be prepared to barter,This is a fantastic shopping open market! Be prepared to barter! Best tip I can give has a bit in mind what you are looking for and price prepared to pay maximum. Have it translated into Korean and when you see what you are looking for show them your translation? Korean's are not for the most part English speakers! Look for shops are not afraid to show pricing. If they don't they have 2 prices 1 for locals and the other for stupid tourists. Many shops show we speak english. Have fun !
Worst customer service I've ever experienced ,"I was travelling in Seoul the first time and had the worst shopping experience I've ever had so far. I was shopping clothes in one of stores and there were some problems I was trying to ask the lady behind the counter. She got impatient and annoyed at me very quick because she couldn't understand English well. The harder I tried to explain the angrier she became. She eventually told me to get lost of her shop as she can't be brother to deal with me. I was shocked and humiliated. I've never been treated like that. I don't think I want to go to the place anymore. If you'd like to shop, try somewhere else besides myeobgdong. They don't care about customer service cuz they all know you as a tourist won't be a return customer anyway. "
Fun..fun..fun,"My family had so much fun strolling around. So many shops, korean made or big brands. Street food stalls along the way."
Nice spot,This is a great place to walk for shopping. Make sure and find the area with the street foods. You can get a great lobster sandwich made fresh for you right there in the street there. Best street food I’ve ever had
Great Shopping!,"This was my favorite ares for shopping in Seoul. Large variety of stores from big brand names, to little stalls. They also had a large variety of food stalls. There are a lot of beauty/skin care stores, but there is so much more. Check it out!!"
Shopping and eat,Good place for shopping for stuff like women make up item and shoes. Lots of street food that you can find local are eating as well. 
Madness ! ,Shop till you drop! And also the street food is beyond-delicious and not expensive at all! Amazing just amazing ... 
You won’t go hungry here for sure;-),"Much nice and clean than most of the asian shopping streets. Lots of underground stores too, they are not all connected. Be aware since it’s easy to get disoriented as which one you get out of the underground outlet."
Street market,"Myeongdong is a hype place to shop cheap things and to buy souvenirs and eat halal street food at the street marker itself. Also, along Myeongdong walkway at the train station itself, you will find shops that sells just about anything, traveling bags, travelling clothing, inner wear, souvenirs etc. A good plc for a good bargain!"
Late night shopping and supper!,"Great shopping district especially for those who love fashion, Korean street food and late night desserts! Lots of choices and prices are relatively reasonable. Gets really crowded at night too. Staying at a hotel in this district is great as you can go back and unload your shopping bags and take a rest too! :-)"
BEST location for Cosmetic and kpop shopping,Satisfy ur cosmetic and kpop need in this area. Full of cosmetic road and go to myeongdong underground to shop kpop things.Really crowded in evening to night because a lot of food stall.loveee
Busy shopping streets ,"I think this area is worth your time exploring. You likely can find what you wants to buy, from this place. There are plenty of shops selling clothing, bags, shoes, toys etc etc. Plenty of street hawkers as well. You will be spoiled for choices. Try to move around comparing prices if you have the extra time and energy, as the same item can be going at different prices at different shops. Can be quite crowded so please take care of your belongings when there."
Tourist,If one loves shopping and food Myeongdong is the place. We went there in the evening and noticed that it was a very well lit and lively area. A happening place with crowds of people. It had both locals and tourists. One could shop anything from there famous cosmetics to clothes shoes artificial jewellery Shops like Uniglo Zara H&M Nike were also flooded with shoppers. You get immediate tax refund in some shops if you are carrying passport with you. Myeongdong is the place for food lovers. The streets are lined with all food stalls. I loved eating roasted chestnuts and the berry juice was amazing. There were hardly any dustbins and one is supposed to carry your junk back with you You could even choose small restaurants to fine dining restaurants If you ran short of money there were many money changers there giving good rates It was easy to spend a few enjoyable hours here It is easily accessible by subway
"Great shopping area for local foods, facial/hair/nail stores","Had a great time in this densely packed shopping area. Lots of places to eat, shop, and visit.We were there during spring break and the weather was nice, crowds a bit less, and the prices were excellent."
Hailing,"We witnessed hail for like 3 mins. That's the first one we saw in our whole life. We're here for the skincare products since Myeongdong is known for that. But aside from skin care, you can find lots of stuff here including massage place, restaurants, Korean mart, accessories and many more."
its all here!,all you need for korean beauty products are here! endless choices and helpful staff. they can converse in english too contrary to what i was told before.
Early trip,"A lot of stores, quite a bit of western branded stores with a mix of local. More commercial than local but still worth shopping here. "
Everything in 1 place,"If you have visited Taipei's ximending, i would say this is much bigger compared to it. You will find many brands of cosmetics, fashion, restaurants, coffee places, cinemas and also duty free shops. Many of the cosmetic shops offer direct tax refund. At night you can try all the korean street food along the roads. Careful that you will get lost. They have map to make your shopping experience easier. People tend to visit here more than 1 time. Well i personally go there more than 5 times during my 2 week visit to Seoul. Famous restaurants like myeongdong kyoja, yoogane, aori ramen until Chinese ding tai fung are there. Of course , you do not wanna miss chicken and beer restaurants. You also can find fashion like H&M, uniqlo, zara , forever 21, spao, top ten etc. It is a great place to shop and dine."
"Crowded streets, plenty options of street foods and shopping ","Heaven for shoppers, especially ladies who love Korean cosmetics and skincare products. I also like the street foods alot"
Every man and his dog ,"This is a great area to get the best of everything - shopping, street food, restaurants and even massage places : be sure to get a foot rub. We had one after a long day on the feet for 18000 won for 40mins.Also recommend going at night.This place is not for you if you don't like crowds because this area is humming with people both foreigners and locals which makes it all an amazing atmosphere."
Ok shopping street ,"Shopping street is ok especially for cosmetic products,the good thing are many great Korean restaurants around if you like to do shopping and have a nice Korean meal "
Great place to buy beauty products,"I took my teenager and toddler shopping here. You can sample all the products. The store clerks do not mind. There’s so many shops selling makeup and facial masks. I needed to do some research before we started. We like Etude House and Too cool for School. If you purchase a lot, the shops give you samples. Which is a great idea, since trying some of the facial cleansing samples, I went back to buy more products. There’s a Forever 21 and two h and m stores here. We just popped in but didn’t buy anything.There are also two Daisos in the area. One is in the basement of the Boots building. This one is small. The other Daiso is on the Main Street in a big building. I believe there’s 7-8 floors. You can get makeup brushes, stickers, nail glue etc at Daiso. The quality is pretty decent.Tons of street food vendors. They come out after 2 pm. We didn’t try anything since the prices were a bit steep.We really loved shopping here."
Shopping myeongdong yeay,"Myeongdong best shopping of the year hahahahhaha.. make up, shoes, clothes dll you must come myeongdong"
Some much shopping and street food,"Clothes, food, clothes and more food! If you're looking for street food, this is the place to come and do it, while clothes and trinket shopping. You have massive options, and the portions are small enough that you can go from stall to stall to try other things too. Theres very few rubbish bins about to be wary about that. Some of the stall owners will be nice enough and take your rubbish, even if it's from other stalls :)"
Street Food at its Best,"Sent a week in Seoul within walking distance of the Myeongdong Market . Although the market area has lots of stores and shops that are open during the day for shopping, the magic of the are is in the evening when street vendors roll in and setup and offer street food. It’s fantastic! You can find all kinds of creative offerings. There’s lots of color, food,and people. The spirit and energy is terrific. Check it out!"
Shopping Heaven,great place for those looking for makeups as they have lots of shop lots here.. street food was great as well.. 
"Mask, shoes and food!","Definitely a place to checkout, even if you don't intend to buy anything, somehow you'll end up with something. Street foods are generally clean and reasonable delicious. Walk out of the main street and you'll find plenty of restaurants, convenience stores."
Busy but fun,"This is a very popular area to shop. There is a large variety of stores, but I would recommend going to Uniqlo for great quality and unique every day styles. Be sure to get street food, but skip the waffles. I found them to be too sweet and not worth the hype. Little pastries in the shape of fish filled with custard or red beans are a much better choice. "
Bad experiences with salespersons/promoters.. ,"The shopping street was crowded but I had managed to purchase my favorite cosmetic products.. However, occasionally we had experienced some unpleasant salespersons/promoters along the way.. They use free mask samples as bait, force you to enter their store & then pressured to purchase their products.. Beware of their attitude, these people are short fused & really rude, especially if you'd decided to leave without the purchase anything.. More than one incident, these salespersons gave us a loud sigh & annoyed face, when we enquire something as simple as for an expiry date or a tester..Another incident where the promoters blocked us from leaving the store until we returned the free samples.. These people leave a bad taste in our mouths & we wouldn't be going back there ever again.. "
FOR LOVERS OF KOREAN BEAUTY PRODUCTS,"A must place to be when you so much love the Korean beauty products. You will love all the highlights and sale items. Especially love the friendly store clerks. I was able to shop in SkinFood and Etude, got me great finds."
"Great vibe, very cool place","Very cool place, lots of shops and restaurants. Literally shop till you drop! In the evening, lots of street food too, very cool vibe!"
Love the street food here ❤️,"Yes, Myeongdong = street food, make ups (beauty products), accessories and clothing. It's a vibrant place especially at night. Hip crowd, bright lights. This place is just beside our hotel (Loisir hotel) so it's very convenient and great! "
An outdoor mall - garish,"This is an overpriced tacky place where people go to look the same. Many of the streets have the same shops on them, so you can look exactly like everyone else in Seoul. Shudder.There are some cool street merchants and the century old Catholic Church on the hill are a nice diverting highlight."
"Extensive range of street food, souvenirs","A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit here. The night market offers a variety of street food, many of which are Muslim friendly and some even labeled halal. We enjoyed the grilled seafood and roasted yam"
Myeongdong!! Where shopping is an art,"The streets and alleys of Myeongdong is an organized maze of clothes, shoes, accessories, make-up, skin products, and street food for all kinds of budget, mid-price to high price. With the popularity of K-pop, comes the popularity of Korean clothing styles and Korean makeup.This is the place to be! After hours of shopping and you're craving some Korean food - don't go any farther. The streets are lined with food stalls and fancy restaurants. It is Seoul's No.1 shopping district."
Excellent street food + shopping ,One of the best street food experiences I’ve ever had. Everything was super hygienic and tasted incredible.We had cheese baked lobsters and Friend Prawns and Oysters and BBQ Chicken!Also the cosmetics shopping was insane.I feel its a must for anyone’s trip to this awesome city! 
Visit on your last day,A lot of beauty products and clothes were on sale. They give free sample of their products in exchange you enter their shop weather you buy or not. Visit on your last day as it will take all your money if you cannot control buying You will not get hungry nor thirsty as local foods were all around
Shopping at myeongdong,"The street comes alive in the afternoon with all the streets hawkers. Their price is the same for the same items so no need to bargain or compare. Many shops like fila, adidas, nike, uniqlo, spao, abc mart and many more."
Skin care and food ,"If it is skin care you’re after, you’ve come to the right place. Major fashion brands live here as well as good eats for good prices. "
Amazing Local Experience,"This place is very alive with loads of different things to do. Loads of shopping (all kinds) and food. I ate in a small very local place in the sides streets, with local Korean food much cheaper than the restaurants in the main streets. Its very easy to reach my metro/subway and you can spare at least 2 h around the area. worth it! "
Shop and Eat,"Amazing outdoor market close to the Myeongdong station. It seems to cover the whole area where you have a series of food stalls as well as clothing, souvenir or sock stalls sprinkled among them. The shops line the edges of the street which can sell plenty of things like beauty products or clothing. There are also restaurants hidden around the area if you were wanting a place to sit down and rest for a bit.There were plenty of people so it was quite lively. It was a really enjoyable experience and came back a couple of times to just look around, shop and eat."
shoppping,"its a shopping area but sometimes it gets crowded, you can also find restaurants there or you could try the street food"
Crowded Place,You can find a lot of street food and cosmetics in there. Full of people! Fantastic actions are everywhere!
Cool Shopping Area,One of the center of city’s business area.Heaven for fashion and clothing lovers.Food places everywhere and food are considerably cheaper and tasty.Walking distance from Seoul Tower.Easy access from anywhere in Seoul via Metro and busses.
Eat & Shop,"There's a lot of things to eat at Myeongdong. It's quite crowded especially at night with the street food.There're lots of cosmetic shop and some even pull you into the shop. Remember to ask for promotion as they don't tell you unless you ask. My sister-in-law bought some cosmetic and before she paid I went over to check out what she bought and during our conversation then the Salesgirl told us if she buy above 30k won then it'll be 1 for 1. To our surprise, she would save half of what she bought if they told her. Luckily she has not made her payment at the cashier, so she went to look for some more stuff to top up."
Heaven of cosmetics and foods,"Instagram @oppakulinerThe best night market here i guess, i spend my 3-5 hours here to eat some great foods (their gingseng soup and chicken are so good) and accompany my friend to buy a lot of cosmetics. The crowded can be handle because the place is so spacious"
The best place to get all your cosmetics and skincare. ,"You'll find multiple stores of common korean cosmetic brands including Banila Co.Brands like Cosrx can be found in Aland.For foreigners who spend above 30,000krw, you can get immediate tax refund when you produce your passport at payment. They may not always ask for your passport so you're better off producing it anyway.The street food can get a bit pricey but it was enjoyable! "
Very crowded but great place for shopping ,"The street is super crowded. Be prepared with many people pushing you around.The street food is very expensive. We recommend you to eat at some proper restaurants rather than having street food.It is a great place for shoppaholic. You can find many great items from cosmetics to skincare, clothes to contact lenses, souvenirs to jewellery in this street."
Cosmetic shop,"If you like to buy Korea cosmetic, you can go here. If you are fans of ft island, cnblue, AOA and the others artist of FNC, you can go to the fnc wow, they sell cake and latte and others."
Amazing Nights/Strange Venues,"This is a place that has everything for shopping - even a Cat Cafe. It is certainly busier at night, so be prepared for the crowds."
BANG FOR THE BUCK!,"this is the shopping haven of all shoppers!everything is cheaper than those sold online - from shoes to cosmetics to clothing. everything is here. oh wait, did i mention FOOD? as you walk all three blocks of the district, you'd always get hungry. so whenever you go, wherever you look, there will always be food that will suit your taste. from lobsters, oysters, skewered beef steak or chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, fresh fruit drinks, and the infamous egg bread!! OMG all of you must try the egg bread. i can't describe it. it's just too good! ofcourse they have ice creams, and bingsu and all. they also have several restaurants and bars and cafe's (dessert and coffee cafe's) that will cater to your liking. everybody that goes to south korea always goes to myeongdong."
"Touristy, but super fun!","I love Myeongdong. It's super touristy, so don't go if you're looking for an authentic cultural experience. But if you love shopping and street food, this place is definitely for you."
"Eateries, Cosmetics, KnickKnacks",There’s never a boring moment here. A must visit - and visit over and over. Saw other parts of Seoul but this is the happening place.
Cosmetics galore!,"We were staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul and the Myeongdong market was right opposite the hotel. We went once in the evening to enjoy the street food stalls which start from 0500pm and enjoyed the atmosphere. We had also reserved the last day for exploring gthis market, but turned out that there's not much for those like me who are not into cosmetics and beauty products. I would have preferred to spend the time elsewhere, especially when we had already visited all other other popular markets in Seoul by then. Comparatively the nearby Namdaemun market has more character to it."
It can be extreme,"Myeongdong is always a good location for tourists due to its proximity to city center, many shopping and restaurants, as well as plenty of money exchange with best price.It is a paradise for girls/women as there are many skin care and fashion shops. The shops close late at night so there plenty of time for making choices. The apparent good side is exactly its shortcomings. There is nothing else to do from shopping skin care. It is actually small and one can walk through every single alleys within one hour. If shopping skin care is not the ultimate purpose, Dongdaemun in fact has a design complex which adds a bit more cultural content. For vibrancy and youth culture, area around Hongik University is my first pick."
Cosmetics!,must visit place for shopping especially cosmetics. cheap and so many discount here! bring your own bag here for shopping! for the streetfood i dont recommend this place cause its expensive and the taste just so so. 
Everyone must experience at least once ,"A bit touristy but you must experience it at least once. Beauty products, food an people everywhere! Shopper's paradise "
Shop till you drop!,"If you're up to shopping, this place is a must. Well for beauty products, this is very a must. I still find some buys in Philippines are cheaper but in here they give you too many freebies if you buy just a single item. As for the street foods, the egg bun is way cheaper in Insadong than here. KPOP albums are cheap in here too!"
"A Pleasure To Wander, Eat and Shop","There’s a wide variety of snacks you can try, from octopuses to lobsters, kebabs to steaks, egg cakes to scallops in shells. There are stalls selling socks, home decor products, suitcases, clothes, etc. You’ll definitely find something you’ll want to buy. If above ground shopping is not enough, you can check the underground mall. "
Great fun,"There is so much shopping to be done in Myeongdong especially if you are a K beauty fanatic. Every major brand is in the area so you can really stock up on all your favourites. Also, there are enough restaurants and coffee places to keep you entertained. Very touristy so if that's not something you are into, then this isn't the area for you. It can get pretty crowded and chaotic but thats part of the experience."
"Best place in Seoul for shopping, money exchange, eat and eat!","If you do not want to travel much for shopping, eat and money exchange, this is the BEST place to stay and go in Seoul!Things might be a little pricey due to this is the most tourist population place but you can really get almost everything here.There are lots of food to choose from as well. From street food, to restaurants...As for money exchange, so far the best rate I found is the 大使馆 (As shown in my photo). It is located just in front of the ambassador where there are many police outside, so very safe as well. There are also shinsegae, young plaza and lotte department store opp the start of the long stretch of street food.NOT TO BE MISSED! The Line Friends store which holds the biggest Brown! (As shown in the photo)"
Shopper's Paradise,"For those that absolutely need to do shopping whilst on holidays in Seoul, then this is definitely the place for you.Don't worry, you're not alone since virtually every other foreign tourist out shopping is here too - yes, it gets very packed!"
Lively ,We passed through here by default whilst going from a to b. It was certainly lively If you are in to shopping site you would enjoy this areaSome street food
Shopping And Food trip,"Shopping haven, dont miss out the small groceries on the secret alleys you may want to check out their food souvenirs around. "
Tour,The best place where you can find all what you are looking for... starting from Korean beauty products to street food & clothes. I was lucky to have this market just on the other side of my hotel ‘Lotte Seoul’ 
Must Visited,"The busiest market in Seoul (comparing to Insadong, Gwangjang, Itaewon, Namdaemun). Visited this market several times during my five days in Seoul. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best place for make-up hunter, and popular brand products. Will be better to visit at night when the light envelopes the crowd. Very recommended."
Korean cosmetics heaven,It is good to buy cosmetics from here. There are many popular brands and many choices of seller who offer discounts. The food is killer too. Would be here sometimes again
"A bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing ","Busy shopping area near the center of Seoul. You can find good deals there. After 4pm, the street food venders come out. That is truly worthwhile. "
Fabulous Street food ,"Shopping countless shopping and Countless people back and forth, lot’s of shops and the street food that start’s at 5 pm, good tip is bring or buy lot’s of water to have with you while going all trough the street food vendors and eating them. Bring a trash bag with you and lot’s of tissue or wet tissue to clean your hands in between vendors...and enjoy this area..."
Cosmetic street,Filled with Korea cosmetic shops. All products are cheaper compared to Singapore also. They have different sales promotion like 1+1 / 2+2 
Beauty and food street ,Best for beauty and cosmetics here.. each shop is slightly different.. there are alot of restaurants here as well.. the street come to life about 6pm with many street goods to choose from but at a price.. the food is not cheap..
Neat shopping area,"Cool shopping district in Seoul. Close to the subway. All kinds of street food vendors from chicken on a stick, egg bread, crepes, octopus. This seems to be the spot for beauty items. A lot of options in that category. Plenty more besides that. There are also a meerkat cafe that has a raccoon, cats, Arctic Fox and wallaby. Just have to be 14 or older. 12,000 won. 5th floor next to the savoy hotel. Couple tips there are multiple of the same shops, so if you are using a shop as reference you might get turned around. No public restrooms we could find, so if you need one you will have to find most likely a restaurant to find a restroom. Also recommend looking up when walking though the streets, there are stores stacked on top of each other. You will need to take the steps to the 2nd , 3rd or higher floor to enter the stores. If you can’t find something most like it above another store and easily overlooked. Worth the experience. "
Spent all day here ,"You could spend pretty much all day here since there are so many shops, restaurants and cafes. The vendors start to set up shop around 4pm in the middle of the streets. That’s when it starts to get crowded and people are lining up for street food. My favorite was the lobster tail but you have to find the right person that takes his time to prepare the lobster tail and make it right. There were about 5 lobster tail stands spread throughout the shopping street. This place looks nice during the day as well as night. It’s less crowded during the day but you wouldn’t get as much street food as evening and it dies down around 9pm which is probably the best time to go to avoid the crowds but still get to try a little bit of each of their foods. "
Everything!,"Food, clothes, cosmetics, music... there is everything! Around 6pm the streets start to be really full of people. Went there 3 times in 4 days!"
Shopping & Eating Paradise,It is a shopping paradise for shopaholics. However the streets food here are not cheap though. And basically you will keep passing by salesperson from the stall trying to you into their store by giving you freebies. Do not go in if you are not interested of the products and do not be enticed by the freebies. Cause they will only give you the freebies after you have bought something from the store. And the salesperson attitude will change 180 degree if you do not buy anything from them after entering.
Cosmetics again!,"When you came to Korea, it is a fun place to go. You can buy good cosmetics at very reasonable price. You can go to the department store, Lotte, I personaly like 新世界departmentstore. I love shopping on the basement floor at the department stores. good food, and easy shopping. But if you are an experienced visitor, Myondong might be little bit tiring."
Streets of Goodies,"Myeongdong, a shopping district heaven I would say. This is a must-go-to-place when you are at Seoul. From fashion to food, to cosmetic and cafes, this is like a one stop point!Had the latest trend food - Issac Toast as part of our breakfast and there are 2 outlets at Myeongdong. The one which is always long-queued, is located near Days Hotel, facing road. So we headed to the one inside which queue is 3 times shorter. Had porridge as our breakfast at 多味粥 and it is located at a basement storey. We had our lunch at 明洞饺子 and their noodle is really yummy. These restaurants you many use google map to find them. Do remember to bring a bag pack with you if you have a long shopping list.CheersJazlyn"
"Cosmetics, Street Food and Nanta","This is really a place for skin care or cosmetic fans. A lot of the big brands have a handful of their shops scattered in each direction. There is a lot of street food available so it feels quite festive. We enjoyed watching the Nanta show at the UNESCO building. I wouldn’t recommend it for food or clothes. Lotte mall is nearby but prices are really steep. Cosmetics and skincare is good though, lots of discounts given, freebies and you are likely to find sales people who can speak English and Chinese. Do your research before going on what you want, not all shops have all products, just go in show the picture and if they don’t have it, they tell you immediately and you don’t waste time. For the same brand Clio, we bought two Kill Cover cushions in Myeongdong for much cheaper than a similar cushion we bought in Busan."
Not cheap for street food for some of the stores,lobster cheese krw15K。sweet potatoes at myeongdong food street selling @3k/piece vs at 7-11 krw1.7k. 
Tons of cosmestic and salesperson waving freebies,"there's many of the same cosmetic shops in all over myeongdong. Some of the quieter ones don't got salesperson outside waving freebies - so you might wander a bit further to another outlet of the brand u are looking for. There isn't much shopping for clothes to do here, and some of the eateries vicinity feel more of Chinese-ish than korean-ish. So if you are looking for authentic Korean food, choose wisely. "
Shopping heaven,"Many cosmetics shop with very reasonable price. A must go place when you are in Seoul as we can try many local food as well. For muslims tourist, there are many Halal food stall along this street. "
Fun place to be day and night,During the day it is relatively quiet. You can easily stroll through the streets and browse in the shops. At night it becomes a street market with numerous food stalls and street sellers. Great atmosphere but super crowded.
fun street! shop til you drop!,"This is the main place for shopping, tourist-trap kinda place, food everywhere!!! During the day, it looks like a regular street with lots of shopping stalls, then around 4pm to late at night, the street food event happens. On average, street food costs $4-5..The stores are the same on the next few streets as you walked through the entire Meyondong areas, lots of cosmetic shops, they are offering pretty much the same deals. There is Paris Baguette, McDonalds, Daiso, minimart, H&M, Forever 21, Line Friends, lots of restos and more shops within shops!!!"
Great deals,"Great atmosphere, friendly vendors, smaller than I expected but still great place to get gifts for ALL price ranges. Great deals all around!!!"
"Expensive street food, but with great restos and shops","This places offers a lot and can be a one stop place if you like shopping for shoes and skin care products. At night, a lot of stalls come around, but their food is expensive! $3-$6 is expensive for street food, but well... had to try what they have because I want to a gastronomic adventure. If you are in a group, I suggest you go to restos around this area because their food is better abd you can comfortably sit and put your food on the table.There are also a lot of other shops for shoes, clothes and beauty shops here and there. Overall, this place is definitely a must visit. It's also near Namdaemun Market if you want to go. It's also packed with tourists btw and when the weather is cold, come to this place because there's a lot of people = heat. lol"
Shopping ang delicious local foods street,"It is the famos shopping place in Seoul who visit to Korea, recommen to shopping here. It is the center of various popular products such as cosmetics, shoes. All the streets in Myeongdong, fashion for men and women The clothes are the most popular brands in Korea and from abroad. I was very crazy to bought 3 pairs of shoes here and many cosmetics for souvenirs for my friends. I thought going back to shopping here again soon. It is cheap and good quality. Ah! don't miss to eat many local foods at Myeongdong food street. Very delicious. "
Great shopping & street food area,"I really enjoyed this area for 2 reasons:a) great shopping for Korean cosmetics. the choice is amazing, and there discounts/offers/loads of free samples everywhereb) street food: really really yum. my favourites have been - chicken dishes and lobster with cheese and finally, the vibe is very special also, stop by Line & Friends. huge brown teddy bear is very cute"
"Fashion, Food & Cosmetics","THE place to find a good bargain of cosmetics and fashion. If you are willing to walk and explore this huge complex of shopping area, you will definitely find good stuff from fashion, bags, and snacks / Korean food. Just walk around and enjoy the lively environment. Local snack food are available abundantly."
Street of fun,This area was so lively. Everything is in it already. The shopping experience plus the best food in town and beauty products. Cheap and good and so clean. I fell inlove with this very busy street. 
Beauty Products Galore,"Great place to buy beauty products. They give a ton of samples with each purchase. Beware though, as some items are much more expensive than Hong Kong. There are also some trendy street wear shops. Mostly went there to enjoy the street food. After a while the stalls just keep repeating with the same offerings. The grilled lobster with cheese, baked cheese and egg bread were our favorites. "
"Cosmetics, Fashion and Food","This is a place to find a good bargain of cosmetics and fashion. If you are willing to walk and explore this huge complex of shopping arena, you can find some good stuff from fashion, bags, and snacks/korean food. Its a mixed things you can found here. Just walk and enjoy the environment.Try the local snack food, it is good and delicious. "
Shopping ,"According to my search and read reviews the one and only decent shopping street of Seoul. Lots of cosmetic shops, local street food stalls , import and local brand fashion and clothing shops etc "
Ain't cheap anymore,"Visited the night market of Myeong-dong and found that food and goods are no longer cheap like before. And the food offered are just repetitions, u can see the it repeats every 10 stalls..... It's getting boring in Myeong-dong"
Food Trip and Shopping Mecca!,"Getting to Myeongdong Shopping Street is fairly easy, just get off the Myeongdong Station and any Exit will lead you to it, some nearer than the others but just look at the directions from the subway and you won't get lost!You need to come here HUNGRY...my cousin and I strategically planned :) and that means, eating whatever we can on the first night then come back on the second until we have exhausted everything..well, guess what, we never did tasted everything, but I am sure we did abt 98%! What we did was buy one of each from stall and shared that way we're able to taste a lot in one go, we came back for the next 3 days and still wasn't enough. we keep coming back for some like the pastry shaped like fish and had red bean or sweet potato inside..so yummy!! the steak and veg was so good too! it's an experience and a real good one at that. one tip or maybe two:bring water and bring a bag for your rubbish. stalls doesn't always have bin bags and if you're like us who likes to walk whilst eating then dispose of your rubbish well.Myeongdong just doesn't stop with the street food..it is littered with shops,,anything you want can be had here, most specially skin care...and don't just buy from one store, shop around coz you'll see some deals in one shop that you won't see in the next! and when you see it, buy it because going back is chaotic...there's so many shops of the same name and the streets are quite confusing most specially at night when a lot of people are roaming around!Have good fun and eat plenty!!"
Nice place to shop in Seoul,"Definitely one of the best shopping and eating area in Seoul. You can find numerous shop here. And some cosmetic shop give customers free mask sheet to invite them into their store. Some good bargains can be found here.There are many famous and traditional Korean restaurant here namely Kyoja, Sinseon Seolleotang, Hadongkwan...However, I didn’t see any bar or pub here."
Busy but you can find almost anything here,The shopping street plus all the street food sold along this street made the area so unique. You can try the street food sold - they are quite tasty especially the bake sweet potatoes.So many shops that sell souvenirs and beauty products. A good place to shop.
Shopping haven for beauty and skincare products,"Myeongdong has everything from food to shopping. You'll find every possible thing for beauty and skincare routines, through all price ranges. The street food there is amazing.. a mix of sweet and savoury. It is the most lively during evening, around 6-7pm.. and most shops are open till 9 or post 9pm too. It was one of my favourite places in Seoul!"
Women’s Shopping Heaven,Cosmetic shopping is a must when coming to Myeongdong!! Passageways are also filled with restaurants and cafes. It is litterally my favorite place. I almost went there to shop every night after my day trips!!
Busy place,Lots activties but roads are not even and i had a sprain.Lots of street food to try!Don't feel it is an ideal place for elerly.
Much to take in!!,"Shop to your hearts content while taking in the sights of an amazing experience. A busy city with bustle and hustle all over, this area can provide you with cheap souvenirs to upmarket items that will tempt the hardiest shopper. Definitely worth spending some time here if you are visiting the city."
Great,Amazing place to walk around and try all the crazy streetfood...HUGE variety of stands! Interesting to go people watching
The nice place to enjoy ,"I love this market the most. I’ve been to all recommended markets but Myeongdong is the best for me. I really enjoy shopping there. There are many cosmetic shops, clothes and also restaurants. In the evening you can find lots of the street food. The price is reasonable too. You can spend a day there!"
Good place for street food and shopping ,"Although it's a bit touristic but it's a good place for Korean street food and nice place for shopping too. You can get your best deal on cosmetic, fashion and phone accessories here. There's also many restaurants and bars. "
Beauty products galore,"Lots of shops and street food. Shops that sell beauty products are aplenty, and I highly recommend trying out their products. Keep an eye too for discounts! There are also clothing stores, from reasonably priced to expensive. There are also good restaurants here, both Western and Korean."
Good place,The area is good you can buy small thing as cap and phone cove .. too many thing to eat .. I will recommend the place 
Street food,Had a taste of fried milk which was nice since I hv never tried that before. Lots of street food and Korean skin care products
Food Food & More Food,Love the many varieties of food and the buzzling of the night bazaar! There were just so many food ard and shopping that we kept coming back!
dont waste your time,"If you have been to Thailand or Taiwan night markets, this will be an utter dissappointment. Street food is average at best. Type of food sold was fruit, fruit juices, potato, noodles, chicken, beef, buns, biscuit, cheese, repeat - all throughout the market. Of course there were pockets of the typical souvenir stalls but you could get better bargains and selection elsewhere (eg. Namdaemun). I find that Lotte Mart (at Seoul Station) gave a more authentic 'Korean' culinary and shopping experience compared to this place."
Busy and merrier shopping street,shopping district for lady who want to shop for local branch of cosmetic and skin care. Many shops will lure you to enter the shop by giving samples (but they will only give you if you enter the shop). 
Love the energy,"During my 7-day stay there wasn’t a day I didn’t get to buy anything. Food, cosmetics, clothes, everything a girl needs is there. My husband enjoyed the street food although he got tired of seeing all the girly stores. We were even able to watch a movie at Noon Square which isn’t crowded. What I like most about the place is its energy—it’s so alive and vibrant. The only place where it’s okay to get bumped at I think. Please make sure to buy from the older street vendors with smaller stalls so we can help them in a way (grandma who sells toys and grandpa who sells strawberries stationed at one of the corners near Zara)."
Awesome street food!,"This place is simply awesome for street food. Lobster tail, potato twists, shrimps, scallops, chicken skewers, you name it. Vibrant and lively, but full of tourists. Must visit nevertheless!"
Eat and Shop to your heart's Content!,"One of the prime shopping streets in Seoul. At night, great varieties of street food available and they are delicious! Do drop by when in Seoul."
From skincare to street food,"You will find many things what u need here. Beauty store, shoes store, street food and many more. Mostly tourist will come here. Too good walk here. So crowded"
Amazing Street,Myeongdong Shopping Street is shopping haven and also street food heaven. if you looking for cosmetic shop or skin care shop or even newest trends of clothing you'll find it all here.
Excellent night shopping market,"Great place to come shop, specially during the evening. Happening market with decent open food market and Shopping ( for ladies only though) available. Even a stroll during evening is worth its while. DO NEGOTIATE HARD otherwise move on to next shop. full chances that next shop will reduce prices on bargaining. Enough shops available for similar brands."
Crowded,I dislike crowded places so this was one of the places in Seoul I do not want to go back ever again but the proximity of the beauty product shops ranging from Nature Republic to Skin Food and tons of other brands is astounding. I love the Lush Store here.
Must go,Easy place for shopping.. one stop shop!! But it is somewhat crowded since everybody aants to go there but definety a place to go.
For the shopper in you,"Been here countless of times, mainly for the street food. Most of the street food open late afternoon onwards so don't come so early if you're there to eat. It's known as a shopping paradise for korean cosmetics but honestly, you can skip it. The shops available there are available elsewhere in Seoul, with lesser people. Only come if you're a shopping junkie who don't mind the hustle and bustle with other tourists."
Skin care haven,"If you’re target is skin care, this is the place. Not a lot of clothes here. Also some great street food."
Shopping and Street food,"This place has a lot more to offer. Food, clothing, beauty products, shoes and etc. you can find here. Its easy also here to exchange money from PHP to KRW with competitive rate. I love the strawberry with chocolate which you can buy in one of stall in the street."
Cultural experience,"What a trip, you could just people watch here all day long. You get true local prices here, a long walk around and you’ll find just about everything, and then some"
Second best market in Seoul ,"Spread over huge area. Mostly cosmetics, clothes , pharmacies and accessories stores. Starts by 10:30 am and open till 10 pm. "
Loved it.,Nice shopping. You can buy clothes to food to jewellery to make up products. Will be going again soon. 
Capital of street food,Most interesting neighborhood in central Seoul Great shopping area with most impressing street food options 
The best place in Seoul!,"During a week in Seoul, every single day I visit this place.During the day, you could find a lot of fashion shops in this area, not to mention the cosmetics shops. If you are a man, shopping with your female partner, hold her hand tightly. Or else she might go wild and spend all the money.This place also has lots of local restaurant and snacks. By 17:00, the locals open more stalls. Most are traditional food. I insist not to leave the market until I try all of them. I gain at least three kg and have no regret at all.The prices are all the same. A grilled lobster tail will cost you 15000 won, whether you buy it in front of the market, or far inside.They also have Oreo’ churros, grilled steak, ice cream with honeycomb, sweet potato, mixed seafood satay, strawberry mochi, twisted potato, and so on. Will be back for sure!"
Food and shopping haven ,"I enjoyed Myeongdong area because I love eating and shopping. It’s a good place to find stuffs for yourself and your family. From branded items to local brands you can find it here. You can visit huge malls in the area particularly Lotte Department Store/Mall. You can also find souvenirs especially at the Underground shopping center. If you get hungry then it’s not a problem as well because there’s a lot of restaurant, coffee shops, food stalls, and a lot more to choose from. Everyone who’ve been there loves it and I’m sure you will too. "
Awesome Street Food,"I love the street food here but its full of mainland china tourists and i believe because of that, the locals avoid this area. What puzzles me is the sheer number of multiple same-brand shops in this area. I think i saw 3 Zara shops, 5 Innis Free & about 10 shops with more than 2 stores within each corner of the street. I wonder how they stay in business."
Place for the Shoppers!,Myeongdong shopping street or streets is for those who love to shop for cosmetics especially. Although there are stores selling clothing and shoes. Several cosmetic brands are found all over the place. Nice place to spend your time even just walking through the streets. You can just eat street food or try the restaurants. Worth visiting.
Shopping district for beauty products,This place has a lot of beauty shops around the area and branded shops. You can also enjoy the Korean street food which I really enjoyed and I recommend you should try. Try going around and see the prices before you buy. But I think all shops around offer good deals.
Great Place for Shopping and Eating,"Myeong-dong is known for cosmetics, but there is all sorts of shopping available. In the evening, expect the area to be crowded with people walking around and food stalls. There are all sorts of options available. In addition to street level shopping, there are numerous shops underground. For those in need of glasses, you can have your eyes tested and glasses made in less than 15 minutes."
Memory,Happy..happy. Enjoy shopping at this place. Many things can buy with reasonable price. Almost every night come and visit this place
Exciting and fun,"Loved the street food there. And girls enjoyed shopping cosmetics stuff, and they had good prices. Very bright and beautiful at night with all the colorful lights. Very safe. It was very close to Marriott at Nandamen. "
A must Visit for tourist,"This is a compulsory place to visit especially for a tourist to get a souvenir, best foods and various choices of cosmetic products. I manage to buy a bundle of face mask with a affordable price and I really enjoy the food there. The food was scrumptious and I can even asked for more. Will surely visit this place again."
Worth going for the experience and the food,"Its a very busy place with local people and tourists but it is definitely worth a visit for the experience. The stores are the same as anywhere else, but there are some market stalls and in the evening lots of food stands to try (prices are reasonable and tend to be similar at different places selling the same thing). Take cash and be sure to have an empty belly!"
Shopping,This is the street of high fashion for everyone including fancy retail shop selling skincare and cosmetics. 
The mecca for cosmetics and street food for every budget.,"Korean cosmetics are king in this area. Streets are dotted with shops selling every sheet mask, treatment and moisturizer imaginable. People hand out mask packs to try to entice you into coming in. If street food is more up your alley Myeongdong is also your place with stands lining all the large streets. Cars and motorbikes can travel through here with little regard to pedestrians so be careful walking. Tourist police walk around this area so help is typically not too far away. Many restaurants here are tucked away above street level so they can be a bit difficult to find.This area has so many dining options it will be pretty hard to get bored. "
My Daughter went crazy 😊😊😊,"We arrived 15 March 2018 and as soon as we have checked-in and rested for about 30mins, we then went out and checked out the neighborhood. It was a good 7mins walk from our hotel and when we arrived, it was already very busy. A lot of street food stalls and things to buy. My daughter went crazy with the number of things she can see and even though it was raining, a lot of people are outside and going about with their shopping. The rice cake covered with cheese that we tried was soooo good although not cheap (6000won), we also loved the fish cake (2000won). There was a store which sold 500g strawberries for 2000won and it tasted so nice!!! After two day we went back but price already went up to 3900won,,,still low compared to the 5-6000won price along the myeongdong streets. We will definitely go back!!!! This is not to be missed ❤️"
Being forced to enter a shop is a NO-NO,"Me and my sister were just having our time, looking at shops and walking near them. Suddenly a guy handed me free mask sample and pushed, literally PUSHED me inside his shop. It's not even a well-known brand to start with. Decided to buy the hand lotion because the salesgirl keep on following and talking in complete Korean and didn't even try to make us understand. After that, we walked in the middle of the street to avoid being hassled anymore. Other than that, Myeongdong is definitely the place for cosmetics, clothes and shoes. Recommended for young people, since the loud music and environment might not match with older people."
"Ok for one visit, but nothing special","I have been there many times, so feel like this place is for Koreans who want to see many foreigners. If you want to feel Korean natural vibe, then this place is not for you, even though it is quite fun to visit this market."
City that NEVER sleeps,"Wild and crazy. Tons of lights, people, food, bars, action and SHOPPING! So much to do and see. It's packed with K-beauty products everywhere you turn. Much better at night than the day time."
Great experience,"Visited the area over several days and found the area had a lot of choice for both shopping and restaurants. The staff selling face masks at every second shop can be a little daunting as they can be aggressive. They offer free samples but if you don't go into the shop, they take them from you.You can find many beauty product shops here as well as all the international branded chains.In the evening the food stalls come out and these are great and offer a variety of cuisines and all relatively inexpensive."
Busy,Shopping heaven for clothing and cosmetic. Lots of restaurant and street vendor as well. Very busy at night time.
Beauty products' heaven,"Myeongdong will definitely be a place that you will return for their beauty products (mask, make up, lotions, beauty tools and etc) if you buy in bulk it will be cheaper and they always have promotion for all the brand there."
Vacation ,Really enjoyed Myeondong. Love the street food especially the egg bun. So so yummy!!!! And love the shopping in the cosmetic stores. 
Be prepared,"The streetfood selections are abundant. Clean because we've been here twice and never had diarrhea. Some are affordable and please avoid the 10,000 won clam with cheese not worth your money. But their 1,000 won sweet potato and 3,000 won gyoza was super worth it. Be prepared to go against a throng of people. Not stroller friendly, make sure you have a sturdy stroller and keep an eye on your children, they could wander. But overall good. Your seoul visit would not be complete without this. "
You shouldn't miss this,"Heaven for shoppers and food hunters. I think you can find all Korean cosmetic here. The street food stalls are numerous charging from 3000W. You may also get some souvenirs. Go try two two fried chicken, and Yoogone, very delicious. Also, you may watch the famous Nanta show here, very near to Myeongdong theater. "
Many shops and restaurants,"If you want do do some shopping and eat, this is place to go.You will find many of them, and you can spend hours there.The best thing is the street food (see my pictures). You MUST try it."
A Shopping Haven,"You dont go to Seoul without going to Myeongdong and experiencing it. What a dynamic place that is teeming with shoppers, tourists, vendors all seemingly at their most vibrant when in Myeongdong. The prices are reasonable and a whole range of stuff to buy. It is a widely known fact, in Myeongdong, one doesnt just get to bring home all the cosmetic goodies that one buys. You get loads of freebies as well. "
"Shopping, Street food, Tourist Area","Variety of street food (corn, spicy rice cake, fruit, etc.). Great place to buy socks, makeup, etc.."
Be prepared to be push nudge because of overgrowded streets,People are always busy pushing and nudging you in the streets also be prepared for pick pockets stealing from you because of the overgrowded streetsThe shops are great with all types of items to buy but they will follow behind you every ever you go in their shop and then force to sell you the item you are interested in
Beauty enthusiasts unite!,"If you are a boy or girl that loves food and all things beauty, then what are you waiting for! This place is a must! I spent a whole day here and also put a bit of dent in my wallet but it was well worth it! There are many of the same shops just down the street from another but that doesn't bother me. This place is a MUST! and just typing this gives me post Myeongdong depression. I will definitely be back!"
Happy Shopping...Happy Belly too...,"For cosmetics, beauty and skincare lover - this is the place to be. There are hundreds of shops and choices of mask, cosmetics, skin care and clothing too..Eateries are plenty around this area so one could shop till you're tired - head to one of the cafes or restaurant for a meal and continue shopping! Street food are all lined up around this area too for those who fancy local street food."
Probably a highlight for many people,"If you came to visit Seoul for the shopping, this is a must-see area for you. Shop til you drop and enjoy all the delicious street foods as well. Plenty of restaurants, souvenirs, and prime shopping stores that line the streets here. Glad there were a few Starbucks here since it was cold out and had a much needed coffee break to warm up. The Starbucks was 3 stories I believe so plenty of space to kick back and connect to wi-fi for a bit. While there are definitely some gents shopping available, the VAST majority of shopping you will find in Seoul will be women's fashion and cosmetics. In any case, the food is cheap, but be sure to bring a few extra bucks to spend so you don't miss out."
Shopping Galore,"I love Korean cosmetics, thats why I went to seoul to buy at Myeongdong. All skin care products are there, they also go on sale almost 50% off so prepare your wallets and credit cards. And dont forget the street foods, try everything! Everything is yummy!!! "
Eat and shop and eat and shop,Plenty of shops for everyone in the family. Many shop selling cosmetics and beauty products. Even the hotel we stayed gave beauty mask to use during our stay. Street food was interesting and fun. 
Shopping heaven,Nice place to shop for cosmetics and sports shoes. Restaurants are mostly fried chicken and Korean food. Do not try any leg or body massage. The money changer in Myeongdong has the best rate in town. 
Good shooping street,I had a good experience with lots of food and shopping area. the street is really crowded and lively. 
Great for shopping and street food,"Wonderful street to check out. Lots of delicious street food in the evenings. If you love cosmetics/skin care, go crazy here! Do be warned about taking “free” samples though. Only do so if you’re ok with the shop keeper following around you and hard-selling you items for 5 mins. (I accidentally took 1 free facial mask at a shop and didn’t dare take anymore!) Other than that, the atmosphere for shopping and eating and soaking in the Seoul life is great! :D "
Shop Til You Drop,"If you love SHOPPING, then this is the place for you. Indeed, Myeondong Shopping District is heaven for those who loves to shop. You can find anything and everything here. From shoes, clothes, K-Pop K-Star memorabilia and of course BEAUTY Products. Cosmetics Power Houses such as Face Shop, Etude and all over the place. Tip, if you find yourself falling in love with the prices offered in one Face Shop, hold yourself first and walk further, look for other Face Shops they might offer cheaper prices of their face masks and make-up. Same shop but offers different prices. What I love about this district is they offer plenty of samples for free to shoppers inside the shops and even on the street. This place is crowded but safe and clean. If you are a tourist, don't forget to bring your passports with you. The shops here offers discount to foreigners just present your passport."
Everything is here,"From Kpop, Kdrama and of course the K Beauty products are all daunting in Myeongdong. A lot of sale offers in different stores that can result to hauling. Also try out the variety of street foods espescially the beefsteak."
Fun fun fun,You can find cheap stuff in here. Expect crowd. There was a plenty of resting area if you get tired for all the walking and shopping
Interesting and must visit,"At night, different stall for food, you would really try different food. You will also shop around. Must visit in Korea. No souvenir shop, mainly clothing, shoes, makeup."
Love ❤️ shopping here ,"We came around 11am Sunday morning , it's not crowded , two tourist information people dress in red to help you and guide you where you want to go which was very helpful of them and save my time looking for the shops like Aland, adidas, olive young,artbox ,Myeongdong kyoja noodle for lunch . Spend almost the entire day here which was worth it . So many boutiques, cafes , cosmetics stores etc . Didn't try the street food here though as I realized the price at the higher range . "
Loved our time here. ,This market is large and a great place to walk and enjoy the area. The food carts when the come out later in the day create an experience second to none! We loved trying all the different food and seeing all the people walking through the market. Kids loved Fried milk and many other cool foods!
Shopping Heaven for Ladies ,"Awesome shopping street. Lots of street foods (halal options are available), souvenirs, restaurants, sports brands, and lots and lots of women’s make up accessories. All u need to do is to bring along a bag load of cash and credit cards. "
a Best Place for shopping lover,"shopping paradise. from fashion, cosmetics, street food. and if you are a korean cosmetics enthusiast, visiting myeongdong is an MUST. they offer a direct tax refund at the store with a minimum of 30000 won. get free samples of cosmetic products from many stores."
paradise for shopping,"best place to buy nice korean make up and cute clothes. i love the face shop brand, innisfree, forever 21 for clothes and even outside they sell some clothes which have a very good quality and nice prices. must visit street in korea, seoul. "
"Chaotic Area, worthy of a few purchasers",Never have I seen so many beauty shops in my life and the even wierder thing was I'd heard of none of them. There are lots of food stalls serving an array of food. You need lots of money for your shopping lol.
The night is young,most important one must know the night market starts at 4pm..there will be many stalls selling street food and souvenirs tshirts etc.uncountable cosmetic shops here eg face shop innisfree and missha etc..all giving great promotions and free samples.the concealer i bought from etude house there cost 7sgd cheaper than in spore..can buy face masks as gifts as there is always buy 10 plus 10 and price is filthy cheap.
Busy and fun,"This shopping district is full of shops and vendors. I found there is a huge emphasis on beauty and makeup products but also clothing. The street food is amazing - definitely try the pastry fish filled with custard or Nutella! If you prefer a really busy, crowded area I recommend going to this area after 3PM as that is when it really picks up. If you prefer less people, go before 3PM but the street food vendors usually aren't there until after 3PM when it gets much busier."
"Beauty products galore, food stalls, shoes, clothing, shopping.","It is a shopping haven for women who love beauty products. Other stores like H&M can also be found here. There are food stalls serving the local Korean cuisine to grilled lobsters. You will also find many variety of sit down restaurants along the strip (no cars are allowed, but, a motorcyle may pass in certain areas). Also, there are smaller malls or squares they call it with local Korean designer clothing, shoes, etc. If you are looking for designer products, go to Lotte Department Store also nearby and you will find Chanel, Louis Vitton, etc. here."
Not my cup of tea,"If you are into asian food, this street will be your heaven, if you are not a huge fan like me, then not really recommend. Crowded street with lots of street food carts"
Good place with good vibe,Myeongdong is well known for tourist for their street food and cheap cosmetic facial product but infact u can get cheaper street food if u are out of myeongdong.There are alot pf variety of street food and there are halal option too. There are alot of facial product on sales in the shop if u are into it.. 
Bring cash and go hungry!,"This place is hopping all the time. Many street food vendors selling delicious foods-eggbread, sausages, spiral potatoes, dumplings, fruit smoothies. Good place to get souvenirs and facial snail masks and creams. There's a Cat Cafe and a Dog Cafe. I think the Meercat and Racoon cafes may also be nearby. It's shoulder to shoulder at times but a lot to look at and entertaining. Remember where you started so you don't get lost. One side of it ends at Namsam Seoul Tower."
Busy busy busy,"Amazingly dense shopping area with mom and pop shops as well as international chains like H&M, Zara, Aldo and uniqlo"
Nice place to people watch,"It is very bustling at night with so many people, a lot tourists. Street food is good but need more variety I think. Shopping is a must-do and there is sale everywhere. Beauty products are a must-buy."
Great shopping,It’s always lively throughout the day but the real fun starts at night with Street food and crazy shopping at every corner
Should check it out,Even if you don't shop you should go check out the cool stores and street food. If you are shopping it has everything you need!
Cosmetics shopping haven,We spent wayyyy yo much time here. It's a busy area with lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. I do find that some prices (mostly clothing) are slightly higher than other non-touristy areas. Lots of street food and restaurants too. It opens till 10pm. Definitely a good spot to hang out at night after visiting all the palaces during the day. Be ready to receive free masks/samples ;) 
Rferreras,Great buys and great food. There are so many items to see and buy for a cheap and reasonable price while enjoying the diversity of street foods.
STREET FOOD AND SHOPPING AT ITS FINEST!!!,what ever you need you will find it here!!( clothing wise). and while you shop you can visit the cat cafe or a game or movie room where you can play games or watch movies in a secluded room. food is no problem here!!! after 4pm there are lots of food vendors on the whole street. from french fries to lobster tails you will find it all food tastes amazing.
Interesting,Good chance to see and taste the local way of life with many outdoor entrepreneurs with local foods and goods
Lively street,I loved going around this street because there are lots of different band cloths and lots of street foods too for those who love trying street food like me Also you can get free face pack...who would refuse if it's for free 
Busy street ,"Busy street with lots of cosmetic Brands... Similar items sell on the street, would gotten lost without a map. A lot of restaurants. Could spend a whole day here ... "
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Shopping here is great, lots of shops and great variety. We managed to go through most of the shops and found some very good bargains from certain shops while others were rigid. The staff at Nature Collection and Sea n Tree win the excellent customer service award!"
Shopping is awesome,"If you’re not careful, you could break the bank on your first day. Myeongdong deserves at least 5 days of exploration if you are into shopping. The quality of the Korean clothing brand are awesome. You will need to do a lot of research with the skin care and cosmetics, though. Otherwise, you’ll end up buying everything you see. There are lots of restaurants to choose from or you can opt for street food. We were hungry all the time, so everything tasted awesome to us. "
Shopping!!,"This place is my favorite because of the cheap korean cosmetics and products. Street foods were also worth the money. The street foods will start at around 4pm (it gets crowded). If you just want to shop, I suggest you come earlier to avoid the crowd. "
Shopping street,Myeong-dong shopping street is the place to go for everything you may want especially in brand clothing. This is a very modern area of Seoul and not where you would typically go to see a traditional street market. The fashion can be a bit on the higher end but a definite place to go to shop for clothes.
Bustling are of Seoul ,Go there and experience the small alleys busy with local shoppers and you might even find a great deal for you! Great street food also in some of the alleys from early to late in the day. Fun experience 
A lot if good clothes,"Korean is known for beauty products and fashion, when it comes to clothing. I like their style, a European and American inspired clothes. Their taste of clothes quite similar maybe because they have the same 4 seasons in a year. There's a variety of clothes to choose on, can bargain as well but don't ask to low. Don't forget to make an spectacles for yourself also, coz they do it very fast and a variety of choices for frames for their fashion taste. Give yourself a try!"
Most happening place in Seoul,"At night, this place is lined with all type street food vendors, you can shop for garments, cosmetic, skin care products and all sort of things while food hunting. Other than street food, there are lots of restaurants as well, that's why i love this place. Try not to have the jajangmyeon from the street vendor, you can have a better one from Hong Kong Banjeom 0410 which is in Myeongdong as well.Just in case you can't find the place you're looking for or you're lost, look for people in red/orange suits with ""!"" symbol on and they will be happy to guide you through."
Everything in one area! ,"Myeondong Shopping Street is a MUST place to visit where you can find everything from name brand clothing, make up, knock-off goods and some really good street food. Excellent place to take the family for strolling around especially at night time. "
Amazing street food at night all the shops you need,"We stumbled across this street because our hotel was around the corner and we found our selves coming back several times just to try all of the street foods. I would say in the late afternoon 4pm onwards the street vendors come out in droves and everything is delicious. Highly recommend the chicken and leek skewer, the fish shaped pastry stuffed with red beans(very sweet) and the grilled cheese with rice cakes. This street has many small bars and cafes on it as well as loads of shopping. Ladies this is the place to go for skin care, there are many stores dedicated to skin care here. Fun tip, they will give you a free face mask if you walk around the store for about 2 min. with no obligation to buy! You can not bargin on food prices here but can bargin on goods. Excellent way to spend the early evening."
"Great food market at night, veggie options too!","There is alot of choice at this market and while not many there are some veggie/vegan options; roasted sweet potatoes, corn on the cob (grilled with flavor or plain/steamed), fruit cups, herbal teas, yaki noodles, deep fried 'tornado potato' and there is one stall- a young guy with three big soup kettles- bean/rice porridge, pumpkin porridge and veg porridge; these are really good!There is also a dumpling stall that has 3 options- veg, pork and kimchi, DO NOT EAT HERE. I asked for the vegetable ones, took one bite and tasted meat, I went back and asked her if they were vegetable and she said 'well they have a little bit of pork in'"
Beloved by both of tourists and locals,"Myeongdong is the most popular modern street of Korea.There are lots of shops, hotels, restaurants and food/merchandise stalls. The main avenue of Myeongdong is one of few broad pedestrian way in Seoul.Also, the connectivities to other touristic areas such as Jong-ro(Jong-no), Namdaemun and Cheonggyecheon Stream are good as well."
Cool place to shop!,It's easy to access Myeongdong and it's a cool place to shop. Almost everybody could speak English or Japanese and it was easy to communicate.
Worth A Visit,Lot of shops to choose from ranging from high end to more affordable stores. We enjoyed the experience and lots of restaurants nearby for a rest in between shopping.
This is a shopping and food heaven!,"Loved this place. Went here everyday for 5 days! This is the best place to get your beauty products. And best of all, I love the street food! Everything is here and you should definitely go!"
Just wonderful !,"My wife loves it here because of shopping, while I eating ! Both Korean brands and international ones. Go there at night time and enjoy street Korean food, and feel the bustling and excitement of the place."
A must,If you stay in Seoul this is a must to watch. Bring with you money and shopalong ;). The place is totally crowded and the smell of Corean food and culture are all over the place. A great and interesting experience for my son and I. 
enjoy your day here for sure!!!!,"a street market from day to night, large area dont get lost. lots of cosmetics, clothes, apparel, cafe, hotel, hostel, snack, drinks, souvenir along the area.find myeongdong cathedral for your kind ref."
Loved every min of it,"Shopping shopping and more shopping . Was a great stop for shopping street food , souvenirs, bags , clothes and basically the whole works . The people are friendly and very interactive."
Can't understand,I don't get why people like it. It's super crowded and the same stores with the same prices are all around the city. Really don't get it.
Fun!,Walked around this area a few nights in a row to pick up street food/go to dinner/look at shops/people watch. Lots going on. Plenty of shopping if you're into that. Great subway access.
So much to take in,"I was staying in the area, so I walked through at many times through the day. There are many places to shop, get a coffee or get a bite to eat. It’s also very convenient to the subway, so it’s easy to get to from anywhere in the city.I am not much of a shopper, but there are tons of places to buy face creams and the like. I was more interested in the street food, which is varied, plentiful and open late!"
Food Heaven ,Cheap and really good food;) my favorite is the fresh strawberry in mochi ;) tge rest are simply amazing
Love this place ,"Convenient with everything in one place. Lots shopping areas, lots of good foods, from restaurant to street food. Amazing market at night. Come visit at night, more street foods like grilled lobster and clam, squid, etc... "
Shopping street,"Like so many shopping street in seoul, this street is offer so many option. You can see alot of street hawkers and also alot of cosmetic stores. You can find the same cosmetic shop in every block. So dont worry if you forget to bought something from your favorite store because it will be another one around the corner. You should try the street food its really good (maybe due to winter weather, i got hungry very often) Slightly expensive since it touristy area."
Not just an ordinary Street,Myeongdong in Seoul is one of the many streets in the city that instantly becomes a shoppers paradise as the sun sets in the horizon. As the evening progresses so as the number of shoppers grew to astronomic proportions. It is a place to enjoy and satisty one’s craving for traditional food and shopping. You can see from the faces of the crowd the enthusiasm and eagerness to find the best piece of item they are looking for. My friends and I arrived in that famous street one cold evening this February just in time to join the frenzy and excitement of the different nationalities of people walking and bargaining for the best available price all around the place. It was exhausting but definitely exciting.
Love to shop in Myeongdong,The boutique sales cheap clothing and plenty of cosmetic to buy. There are plenty of restaurant to eat plus there is a food street to taste the local food.
Shopping haven,The street that never sleeps ! everywhere you get you'll find the same shops like a hundred of them in each corner the shops streetfood are amazing! definitely keep coming back to this place.
Shopping ,Enjoyed eating street food and shopping but expensive . We found other places cheaper food but far. Myeongdong area has lots of things to do.
Some lovely shopping in the heart of Seoul,"Myeongdong is famous for its national brands and shopping centers as well as various food courts. You may find everything you need here varying from phone cases and souvenirs to face masks, clothes and electronics. Prices in the street shops usually decrease by the end of the day, so evening is the best time for some profitable shopping. "
Just a regular shopping street,Not so atracctive for me. Like other cities Seoul doesnt have only one shopping street. There many places u may shopping and may taste street food. But the Myeongdong is the best known 
Loved Myeongdong !,"We chose to stay in Myeongdong for our first visit to Korea. Glad we did since there’s a ton of action here and everything else was close by as well. The shopping street had everything you could imagine, but prices were as expensive as they were in the states. There are tons of street food vendors, but none of them were truly that great. "
A good place for shopaholics,"We stayed at a hotel near Myeongdong, so we went to this street everyday. There were variety of shops in this area. At about 4.00 pm, they opened the stalls along the Myeong-dong 10-gil. There were a few halal stalls where Muslims can taste the local food. There were also a few halal restaurants in this area, but I think they were overpriced. Anyway, it is recommended to shopping during sales season. We got a lot of discounts plus tax refunds. "
Buzzing,Buzzing for most of the day. Don't expect any nightlife late on Friday though - it's dead. Otherwise plenty of shops and restaurants.
Chat an adventure!,"What a fun way to spend a few hours while in Seoul. Something there for everyone.. Street food, clothing, or anything you may need. A bustling place to be."
Shops Galore,Tons and tons of shops both brand name and unheard of. Many restaurants and cosmetic stores. The best part was the street food carts which set up mid to late afternoon and into the evenings. Plenty of coffee shops too.
Shopping Paradise! ,"I think if you planning for shopping and eating, you should spend a day here! This is the shopping paradise of seoul! The street are awesome, i can’t stop eating! Quite hard to find toilet, so ask the seller where’s toilet, and they will help! "
Shopping paradise,Very busy area but safe at night with police every corners. Prices are the same all stores. Dont need to bargain prices. Lots of street foods and eatery places too. We had fun!
Interesting place for foodies and shoppers,"What I like about this place: (1) street food starts in the evening - enough variety for you to sample local dishes. I particularly enjoyed the sweet corn, chestnuts (the best I'd tasted so far), cuttlefish, fresh strawberries, dried persimmons, kebabs, Oreo Churros etc, price ranges between W1000 to W7000 (2) cosmetics etc - so many stores to choose from. The aggressive salespersons need to ease off a bit though. Bring your passport along so that you can claim VAT refund immediately if you spend a certain amount onwards (3) there's a fast food joint called Mom's Touch - famous for it's chicken. Tried it's Shrimp Burger, it was yummy (4) caps, mufflers, belt etc - you can get some of those cheaper at the neighbouring Namdaemun (5) a great place to just people watch"
Must see in Seoul,"Lovely place to visit with its busy shops, hawkers selling their wares and food, can get quite busy during afternoons with a wide variety of shops."
Street Food Galore,Really enjoyed this street. Plenty of street food - come with an empty stomach and a pocketful of cash!
Food,"You don't have to go far if you're hungry. This is the place to go. Variety selection of food stalls at night, rows of cosmetic product shop along the street. Too many options. Lovely."
Mey!,"Why travel all the way to South Korea to see all the international stores that you probably have at home? Myeongdong is interesting as a cultural event, given that culture is how people live now and not just in the past, and the area is a people watchers delight, especially with the lively street food stalls. Lotte sells baseball boots for around $250, so watch, have a coffee, freeze (we are here in February!) and enjoy being part of a massive hive of activity, but keep your wallet or purse tightly shut!"
Too many foreigners,"My friend and I recently visited the famed Myeongdong shopping district.There was a ton of people outside despite the bone-chilling 5 deg (F) temperature.We had greatly looked forward to exploring the street food scene, but came away somewhat disappointed.First, the prices were not as cheap as we had imagined. The food, for the money, was just okay.The main reason for the price inflation was the number of foreigners meandering the streets; most visitors and street vendors either spoke Chinese, Japanese and/or English.In order to find more authentic Korean street food vendors, you will have to go else where.Regardless, Myeongdong is something you should experience while in Seoul."
A must see,"One of the busiest street in Seoul ...you can enjoy the amazing korean street food (tornedo potato,grilled shrimps,...)Very alive area and specially during night...great vibes and great people.Korean are really nice and friendly."
Lively area ,It's a very high and lively area since morning till late at night. you can find alot of skincare brand and cosmetic along myeongdong area. But it seems to have same brand branches in the same area. The street foods are very expensive comparing to other places. We had taiyaki for krw2.000 while you can get it only krw 1.000 in other place. Not a good place for food hunting for sure but good for shopping. 
Rude Salesman All Over,"We initially thought it was the bad cold weather caused the bad mood in their salesmen, but we finally agreed it was their attitude towards tourists needs to be improved.. if you are a tourist who wanted to buy something, but you ended up didnt buy anything be it due to their miscommunication eg language problem, or you didnt find what you want, they simply scold you..some of them really were bad tempered..u ll be surprised!!"
Food and shopping,"Almost a one stop shop, this place is wonderful to shop in or even stall-hop food tasting. We love being able to share small portions and trial our street vendors at this street. This street is super close to the myeong dong station and conveniently open til extremely late at night. "
So much to see and eat!,"Myeondong is a place I would recommend for people who want to shop or eat! There are s many stores from high end to forever 21! The streets are lined with food carts serving fruit, chicken, lobster, sweet potatoes, shrimp screwers, to more traditional Korean delights. There are also restaurants that you can sit and dine. There is underground shopping here as well. "
Shopping time!,Myeongdong is not my favorite. It is too crowded.. But it offers you so many foods you can try.. their pop up store is a thing
Very fun experience!,"Lots of food and clothing to buy! There are some clothes that are as low pricing as 5,000 or 10,000 korean won and they are all made in korea! A lot of cosmetics shops as well. A really good place to visit especially if you're after clothing and cosmetics! :) The street food were super tasty as well."
Never get bored here,"Every time i came to korea, i would stay near Myeongdong shopping street. There are simply many eateries and retail shops around that you will never get bored here. The eateries closed quite late too and tones of pharmacy, convenient stores and money changer around. So you can practically get wherever you want here. And coming here once throughout your trip will never be enough. It is just wonderful."
Fantastic!,"Absolutely a must see and do in Seoul. Make it a night. Eat on the street, shop for cosmetics, feel the vibe, get a fashion upgrade. Strictly an evening affair, the later the better. We thought the best market, a bit more upscale than the others. The most fun we had in a very great city. "
Interesting market,This market has a lot of different things to offer...ask at the tourist booth if looking for something special...also do not forget to check underground shops
Shopping Avenue,"Korea has large beauty product marked that expanded in all over country. All beauty korea make up brand you can find it here. Not only make up, you’ll find fashion store, restaurant and also street food here. So here is the best place for one stop shopping."
I have absolutely no idea why people come here.,"I came here because of a meeting. The streets are filthy with trash, it’s crowded, every stores are overpriced. Would not recommend."
Varieties,"A vibrant place to be for shopping. These streets have endless choice of beauty products, clothes, shoes, street food, restaurants to choose from. Very close to Myeongdong subway station hence very convenient. Only I find lacking of dustbins."
Shopping and Street Food Heaven,"Tips - only goes for the stores that give free samples. :-)Try all the delicious street food here such as egg buns, busan fishcakes, grilled octopus, rose ice cream,etc.There are many halal food here for Muslim and a Gurkha Restaurant.The Myeongdong Shopping Street is so alive from morning to night."
Heaven for people who like shopping!,There are so many stores there!! Cosmetic stores are everywhere!! Many good restaurants here too! This is really a heaven for you who like shopping!
ECITED!!,"I do really loves shopping, while i was in Myeongdong i just can't get lost by myself because i just want to shopping. And so many shop that we can find with the same shop maybe. example you can find 3-5 of Nature Republic store. Besides that, it was so enjoy being there because so many street food in every single road and very cheap it's about 1.500 - 3.000 won. "
U need to bring a suitcase here,"You won't be able to resist a lot of skincare/cosmetic promos here, better bring a lot of money and extra suitcase :))"
Shopping street,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is the biggest shopping center in Seoul. Lots of fashionable clothes, shoes and other equipments will be found from Myeongdong"
Lots of Stuff......Not so Cheap!,"I found this shopping area do have everything a typical tourist would need. However, I found their prices are way too expensive. You can definitely find the same items in other places: subways, student districts, even other lesser known tourist area. As for the food stands - they do have any choices; but mostly cater to Chinese tourist."
cosmetic paradise,along the way you can find all cosmetic you need here. every store push 1 or 2 of their employee to offer a merchandise to attract customer to visit their stores. you can easily find a brand have 2 stores here.
Seoul Food Street,"The street is lined-up with Seoul's street food. By the time you visited the whole area, you will find yourself full with all the hard-to-resist food being offered. Oh and you get your fill of fashion and cosmetics. Definitely a place to visit again."
"Street food, restaurants, cosmetic lovers, good money changer, downtown tax refund, happening place ","Staying in this area made us explore this place every night. This area was filled with cosmetic shops, restaurants, cafes, street food, downtown tax refund, and any other stores. What we loved most was the street foods. We tried all kinds of street foods. If you want to exchange the money, you can find it in area near Chinese restaurants or Chinese embassy. "
Happy place for ladies,"I was amused by all the cosmetics brands. Manage to get a very good deals from laneige and skin food. But what i love most is the Innisfree Green Cafe, i love the concept and every detail of it. I wish we have more time to chill there."
Shopping central with great food options,"Myeongdong is every shopper's must visit in Seoul. Almost (if not all) can be bought here. Cosmetics, clothing, shoes, all things KPOP, for those with limited time, shopping in Myeongdong will already get you far. All cosmetic brands are here, stores for clothing for signature as well as reasonable options are also everywhere. Personally, I enjoyed shopping and going around in the evening since so many food stalls are set up for the evening market. This gets the shopping crowd really going and it can get very crowded with lots of tourists and shoppers everywhere making the experience even more interesting. After a long and tiring exploration of the sidestreets, it's good to relax in the restos or cafes that are just as numerous as the retail outlets or sample some street food along the main street."
Good stores but poor service at some store,"Anyone who loves Korean cosmetic know this place, a lot of blog mentioning them as beauty street in Seoul. Nice place for sightseeing and quite lively.But we have bad experience shopping here. The staff greet me in English (she also can speak Chinese with other staff) so i explain what I want, but she didn't listen what I said and rude ! She even mumbling 'whatever' in Korean when she pick the wrong product (she think I didn't know simple Korean eh?)Next store are not much different. Compared with other tourist who bring big suitcase & buy bunch of product, we shop only for our personal stash. Why treat us differently? And again I get nasty treatment from staff who can speak (mostly Chinese speaker). So we just grab what we want, not even bother to try then leave asap ! Then i learned from friends that they're not Korean,...hmm Ow-kay ~ The Korean staff are nicer, not rush you when we test the product, but they not speaks English well. Still, i prefer to be served by them. Advice : For shopping peacefully, better go to another store chain such as at Ewha Women University, or anywhere but here, some stores are bigger and friendlier."
"Lots of shops, can be overwhelming at times","Myeongdong shopping area is huge. With a large concentration of shops, first time visitors can be easily overwhelmed. The streets can start to look similar and getting lost is easy. First time visitors should not try to do everything in one day. Have a shopping list and address and picture of shops you want to visit, it will easy to ask for information with those. Address if possible should be in both English and Korean.The place really become alive in the evening as food vendors start setting up food carts along side permanent stalls. Do beware of eating from these food vendors as you are still trying to get use to the food as a tourist. Overall Myeongdong shopping area can be enjoyable if you come with an open mind and try out the different food and shopping experience."

You can find halal street food or vegetarian food also. There are halal restaurant also.You cand find Line store but the store is smaller than in Itaewon branch. Then, it is more expensive than in Line store, Dongdaemun Plaza. Almost store in Myeongdong is closed at 11.00 PM. Don't missed last subway if you stay faraway from Myeongdong like Hongdae area. It because the taxi was very expenssive arround 20.000 won-40.000 won. But if you know Hangul you can use bus for other alternatives."

Shopping for facial products,"If you are looking for facial creams and products, this is the place to go to.

Fun evening,We walked around here eating some of the street food. There are several things to try. The retail consists of a lot of beauty product stores and a few clothing stores. There are also a lot of restaurants to choose from. When I have gone in the evening or the weekend it has been really crowded and difficult to walk.
Great shopping,"Good for those who are looking for facial products and stuff. Bad for those who dislike crowds. In general a good place to spend the night, shop closes later here as compared to other areas"
"""Shopping haven""",""" a lot of sale items(beauty products) perfect for the ladies"",like facial creams,eye creams,facial wash,make ups,they also have facial mask as giveaways to every buyer that will visit their stores"""

The mask ,"At the shopping street only few things available:Cosmetics, mainly beauty maskRestaurants, Korean BBQ - quite tasty everywhere Clothes, any styleStreet foodNice atmosphere especially at the nightfall "
"Street food? more than that, of course.","Street food is awesome but not the cheapest, restaurant is plentiful,cosmetics shops are everywhere and few money changer when you need it. But do not rule out on everything else. Just remember, bring cash, bring cards and bring passport."

"As an intro course, class was very friendly","I appreciate the attention-to-detail the class offers for foreigners and feel that for newcomers to Korea that are interested in cooking, this is one class that you should consider for getting to know Chris, Korea, and of course cooking with Korean ingredients."
Too crowded and noizy,The seller from the shops are trying too hard to get you into their shop! Even grabbing by the hand. Didn't like this area at all.
Must go,Vibrant and you will be spoiled by the varieties of food and shopping plus the UNIQLO flagship is there next to the subway!
Insane beauty capital + added street treats,"This part of town is insane! You can find any and every beauty product known to man in addition to nearly any kind of street food. Blow torched lobster and clams, anything fried on a stick, chocolate covered fruit, things you have seen before and things you have not. Definitely worth a few hours to eat and shop your way through these streets. Bring cash!"
Cosmetics paradise on earth,"If you are a shoppaholic and one of your desires is cosmetics and skin cares, then this place is yours! You can find the number one quality of Korean skin cares and cosmetics in this shopping street.

In Korea, foundations are more suitable for pale and yellow skins!"
Shopping Heaven ,"Each shops have different promotion. So be ready with the promo temptations. Visit to Olive Young is a must, there's several outlet here. There's the biggest Olive Young outlet in the area. "
Face mask central!,"One after another, the cosmetic shops line the pedestrian streets. Young salespeople entice you in with free samples. There is so much choice, it’s hard to choose, but at these prices, it’s worth trying everything. Makes for great gifts to bring home! Lots of fun shopping here."
Come once and you'll love it,"This place is happening at night with street food stalls along the street, pubs, cosmetics shops, cafes, major fashion brands & all you could ask for. We ended up stopping here every night to take a peek at what might not available the day before.. since it's winter, some stalls might open some might not because it's freezing"
Like night market.,"Heard so much about Myeongdong so i stayed in one of the hotel there on the last 2 days of my 10 days trip in Seoul, but was disappointed. The area with alleys of shopping but mostly skincare and cosmetic shops are like night market because of all those repetitive food stalls outside. Too crowded and DIRTY. Not my type of shopping experience. Not to mention prices are not cheap but certain items. Next time I will not stay in that area anymore. Prefer to stay in Gangnam. *The hotel I stayed in Myeongdong was GOOD though."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Alot, alot of things here. Very crowded and this place is huge! There is a metro station so it is very convenient to get there. As this place is so big, there are many exits to this station. You will find alot of shops/cafes/restaurants at this place. At night, you will see hawkers setting up stalls to sell street food"
so much to see and buy,"love this place spend hours looking at all the amazing shops and people, and buying a few things. great eating places"
very big market,i love to buy in here because it is cheap. i bought a winter clothes and i never regret of having it even if i cant use it in the philippines because it really helps me a lot in my stay here in korea. 
Seoul Korea,"Since it was January it is cold, We did the hop on hop off two different routes, very informative and I highly recommend this to all travllers to get there bearings around the city."
Visit to Myeongdong ,"My wife and I visited Myeongdong to browse the various shopping areas. This place was full of brand name shops that anyone would want to visit. We ended up eating at California Pizza Kitchen. Additionally the best time to come is Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights was there are numerous food stands. "
Shopping haven for anything Korean,"We stayed in this area because it is a one stop place for all of the Korean cosmetics and shopping. The street food comes out after 5-6pm on weekdays, they are quite repetitive but good to try here and there."
One of the hottest place in Korea,You can do everything in Myungdong. There are every kind of stores. But it’s always crowded of people. I recommend you to try sstreet food!
Place to buy your cosmestics,"We visited Myeong Dong in early Dec 2017 and it was very cold. Even though it was freezing, the crowds did not stay away and the streets were full of shoppers. This is the place to get your cosmetics, and some shops also offer on-the-spot tax refund, no need to do so at the airport. My children enjoyed the street food, particularly the 30cm long ice cream, because it did not melt cos'it was cold. It was an enjoyable experience."
Best place to buy face/skincare products,"Be prepared to lug back bags of face product. Face masks are usually 1 for 1.Also heads up for sneaker fans, i bought 4 pair. I should have brought more money there "
Shoppers Paradise,Great shopping area! Very expensive though! Many stores have multiple shops throughout. Great restaurants and street food. Very festive atmosphere.
It was a fun experience,"I visited Seoul when it was -15 degree so I didn’t really take my time to walk around. But I like the vibe. You can eat street food, shop at the stalls on the street or go to the shopping center on both sides of the street. "
Shopping street at Myeongdong today,Shooping Time at Korea myeongdong Shopping Street. Many food many kosmetic lotion etc anything ok in here. Minus 10 celcius very cold. But many people in here. Yummy resto in here. Jacket winter ok in here buy and lipstick anything in here. I like shooping street at myeongdong Korea south
Lively with lots of choices for food,"I visited in November and went to MD at around 4pm in the afternoon. You can find all sorts of food here from japchae to deep fried oreos. I would recommend coming later in the early evening when all the stalls are open, but mind you it's also peak hours for the street so it will be fairly busy/crowded."
Great for make up lovers,"If you have a wife who loves wearing makeup, take her Myeongdong Shopping Street. Kind of heaven for them. For others, nice shopping street but pricy. Close to Seoul stLine 4 (light blue line) - Myeongdong St - 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
Nice place for shopping 🛒 ,"Very interesting street for visiting. A lot of shops of famous brands with sales, cafes, restaurants, massage salons and pubs. Also there’s a street food . Mmmm. Delicious ! Try to eat some desert with strawberry ! And don’t forget about VAT refund. Good luck "
Heaven for shoppers,Perfect place for shoppers who loved cosmetics products! They sell it much more cheaper than in my own country (Malaysia). There’s a total of 400 pieces of mask I bought! 
Always a great shopping experience !,"If you are a shopoholic and into Korean shopping experience, this is the place. The local cosmetics, fashions, specialty stores, local hawker foods to restaurants are all here. "
Great beauty products,"Good shopping for cosmetics and mid range fashion products. Great street food, go early to avoid the crowds."
Shop until you drop,"We went to Myeongdong during the sale season. So many shops offering real sale from skin products, shoes, bags. Enjoy the street food as well as restaurants offering superb Korean food. Experience a visit to a dog cafe. Amazing dogs."
Street Food Street Food Street Food,"Seoul has numerous shopping streets but I personally liked Myeongdong the most. I dont think it was the biggest one but it believe it had the most choices of stalls and branded boutiques in all the shopping streets we visited so it was quite crowded. To me the best part of the experience was the variety of street food available! From grilled lobsters with cheese, grilled giant scallops with cheese to steaks and sausages, bread, ice cream and desserts and lots more. Oh of course the ever present fish cake soup! It was awesome! "
"Make-up, clothing, and street food!","This area is a constant hustle and bustle of activity! It spans a couple of streets and is filled with fashion and cosmetic shops. The vendors set up at different times, but I suggest going during the early evening for the full experience."
Fun and busy,"We stayed at Lotte Seoul which is about 5 minutes away from here so we came here every day. There is so much to buy and see. Make up shops everywhere with good quality cheap makeup which is made in Korea. Restaurants everywhere, we had lots of really good cheap meals here everyday. Korean BBQ is so delicious and so good for you. Especially when it’s -7 outside and you’re inside a restaurant eating delicious beef stew.Early afternoon they bring the market stalls out with vendors selling everything from food to phone covers or doggie costumes!We loved it. Very safe with lots of variety. A must visit."
Shopping & Food Street,"We came here on Christmas day morning. It's already crowded even at about 11am! I see the food stalls are already opened but it was too cold for us that morning that we went in to Young Olive instead. The Young Olive there is big (two-storeys), with lots of stuff from moisturisers, face masks, cosmetics, hair & beauty products, and even a cafe upstairs. I wished I came here on my own instead of with my 2 kids!"
Interesting Shopping Street + Street Food,"The street food and surroundings are cleaner than other shopping streets I've been to. There were countless beauty and apparel stores. Heck, even the street vendors sold clothes. You'll find plenty of restaurants and branded Korean and foreign goods.We came here to watch a popular tourist show called Nanta. Since it's a dance comedy, you don't need to understand the language to understand most of it. Pro tip: book the show yourself to get discounts. Don't go to the tour agencies. Heck, for a promo, I got a premium adult seat and the whole thing was 1,000 won cheaper (69k) WITH a gift box that without a gift box (70k). Minors can get discounts if they bring their passports or an equivalent ID.This street is a few mins walk by train. One of the nearby bus stops is near the largest Uniqlo in Korea. As a foreigner, you can get by on commuting using Google Maps (for bus & train), the Korea Subway app, and a T-money card with load. You can get a T-money card at a convenience store or the airport. For walking or driving directions, the Waze app can helpWe went during winter so some of the alleys were really cold when the wind came. I suggest bringing cold protection for your face if you're weak to that."
A must for a K-Cosmetic lovers!,"Great! They have whatever brands that you want! They always have this buy 1 free 1 promo which i always fall for...LOL. However when the time we went there it was raining and later snowing. So, i suggest you check the weather forecast before you go there as there are no shelter - unless you go in one of those cafes or restaurant..."
Amazing ,"When you go there make sure you bring cash with you or have your foreign exchange already done. There’s lots of options of tasty street foods to choose, it was an awesome experience especially the shopping part .. If you use card often it is very accessible, you can use your visa card or debit in paying and you’ll get a tax exempt or refund thing that they called if you show your passport paying with your card ..and they will give you a percentage sale also.it was a wonderful experience indeed I want to experience it again. My Korean friend help me understand and explained stuff while I was there. And people are very nice and friendly."
Great for young adults shopping,"Myeongdong, Seoul's oldest commercial district, is not for everyone, but for young adults, it can be wonderful - particularly in terms of boutiques and street vendors who aim at the younger demographics. There is an undeniable high energy along its streets and its stores that appeals to largely people younger than age 30. There is a very large range of restaurants in variety and price ranges.Historically, the district was the first modern commercial district, developed by the Japanese during the colonial period. For decades, before the development of the large Gangnam communities on the south side of the Han Gang, Myeondong was THE shopping district of Korea. Today, it is more focused on the young."
Best place to shop,"So many stores and lots of music everywhere, everything is super cheap, so be prepared to go crazy!!"
Get a feel of the area,Lotsa shopping for fashion and stuff. Ample street food along the way and mini marts to stock up your fridge. Bustling crowds and its is safe and welcoming.
Superb Shopping and street food!,"Superb Shopping location especially during Christmas. Lots of great deals up for grabs! The place is fun filled with many activities. There was a night where we saw a few locals holding up signs which says ""Free Hugs"", how Christmas spirits should be :). What's more the ever famous Nanta show is located here. Definitely a superb place to visit."
Exciting streets of food and goods,"We stayed opposite Myeongdong Street and every night, we would be walking the streets enjoying the snacks. Surprisingly, I find it is cheaper to buy some stuff in the underground shopping than on the streets."
Shopping Area for Ladies,"This is a shopping area for ladies. They can enjoy great discount. Almost all branding has a branch at here. However, the tasty of food just so so, no matter shop or street food. Suggest traveler just shopping here and go to any place for traditional foods, such as City Hall etc."
Great shopping area!,There were many skin care shops...almost too many. The food carts on the street were great! They were set up in the evening with huge variety of food and snacks. Yummy!
"Lots of street food, and knock off brand names","It is fun just to walk around. If you like street eats, it is definitely a place for you. Knock off stuff is very reasonably priced."
Lovely place to shop with a good atmosphere,"The place was lively both in the day and at night, with a good atmosphere. There was a wide variety of food options (porridge, barbequed meat, chicken soup, noodles, street food etc.) and products (although mainly cosmetics and clothes based). There were quite a few shops with open wifi networks which allowed us to access the internet easily.Do take note that many shops offer instant tax refunds (but you need to spend a minimum amount first). So, do remember to 1. Bring your passports 2. Check how much the minimum spend is (in our experience it was 30,000KRW). "
SOOOOO lively and beautiful especially at night!,"This is the place you dream to be in if you're a natural shopper and a foodie! The street can be full of people especially at night and it's so easy to get lost but no worries! There's a police station at the centre and tourist information just beside Boots and Olive young (the biggest one). There are also many banks here like Woori, Shinhan, and Standard Charter. There's also wide array of money exchange. We usually go to the one right across from the biggest Olive young store or to the one near the Chinese primary school. So many stores shoving their free masks to you while you walk BUT don't ignore it! It's your chance to try their mask and you there's a possibly that you'll love it and buy some more! And go try the local foods! Most of them are unusual for me but there are some that I loved! ENJOY MYEONG-DONG!! I sure did! "
Good place for shopping,"It will be a good place for shopping of skin care products, sport goods, accessories, closed to Sinsegae and Lotte Department store, with quite a lots of restaurants, but I found the staffs at restaurants that provide the traditional Korea food service are in general much better than the ones in the chain coffee shops or fried chicken restaurant (with any smile).."
Family vacation ,"This place has the most shops from foods, clothing, cosmetics, electronics and entertainments. The street foods have many varieties and the Koren cosmetics are reasonable priced. The best place to shop in Korea. "
Shopping Paradise for ladies,"Cosmestic everywhere, bags and shoes everywhere, accessories everywhere and also - food everywhere. Come slightly later in the afternoon for the stalls to be operative, earlier would only have shops. "
Myeongdong Shopping Street til 11pm.,"This is the place for ladies to shop for makeups and street food for the men. Many cafe's and restaurants. The shops and streets vendor close at 11pm. so you can shop til late. The hotels I recommend - Prince Hotel, Pacific Hotel, Loisir Hotel, L7 Hotel and Sejong Hotels. These are the nice good hotels near to Myeongdong MRT station. Tour company will tell you to meetup at this station if you engage them for the land tour. The meeting place landmark is the Prince Hotel and the North Face Cafe. Very easy to find. For Muslim there are few halal street hawkers and only one Halal restaurant which is the Busan Jib located at Myeongdong 8gil.this is the street name. I was told by the Busan Jib staff that another similar Halal Korean BBQ restaurant will be open in Myeongdong in Jan 2018. So lookout for it. Busan Jib Korean BBQ. Its Halal. Note: Dresscode depends on the season. Extremely cold in winter and about 35Deg high in summer."
Vibrant street!!!,A must go place to go.Unlimited abundances of shopping.Unlimited abundances of food.Unlimited abundances of tourists.A place not to be miss!!!
What a great outside market and shopping,"I went there 2 or 3 times during my visit in Seoul. As it was in december, it was a bit cold but always very crowded.You can find numerous items from bags, food and clothes.If you want to feel what the life is in Korea, i would say this is the place you need to visit.At the same time, so many different Korean BBQ to try..I would like to go back at summer time to fully enjoy but was really good, even in winter."
New Years stroll,"After hearing the early evening Mass at the Cathedral, it was a nice walk with a number of street food. Might be a bit pricey at first glance but all the prices of street food are the same wherever you are in this district. Grilled lobsters, shell fish, corn on the cob, strawberries, waffles etc. "
A must to visit,"Being to Korea for the third time and this is a place we will not miss out. A place with tons of cosmetic retail shops, restaurants and street food. Over the years, prices of the street food increase tremendously. I will recommend more on patronising little restaurants serving variety of great food along the streets which is more worth it. If you love this place. You can choose to stay in one of the hotels there. As it is very centralised in the heart of Seoul. "
Myeongdong street ,Best place to try korean street food . Happening place to be with lots of things to shop . Definitely will not leave myeongdong empty handed.
Cosmetic deals and food,Can find good cosmetic product deals at the streets. Also a nice place to taste great street food around the area. 
Skin Care Heaven,"Rows upon rows of Korean cosmetics shops. Plenty of clothes shops too. You can shop your heart out here and when you go hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants nearby. At night there are food carts which add to the lively vibe of this district. When shopping for cosmetics, do compare prices even between the same brands. Most brands have multiple branches in this district and some are even opposite each other. Some branches have deeper discounts than the others so look around before purchasing anything."
"Food, jewelry, clothing","Wow - loved shopping here! There is something for every one. I felt very safe and there were couples, solo people and families all having s great time. Just a block away from Myeong-dong train station so easy to find."
Endless amount of shops!,"You could get lost in Myeongdong, there are rows and rows of streets lined with shops. Myeongdong is also host to amazing + cheap street food (I've tried the crisps on a stick and the ice cream that's about 2 feet long), but make sure you go in the evenings for the food."
Shopping is not my thing but...,"I don’t have the shopping gene. My hotel in Seoul is in the heart of Myeongdong though, so I thought, when in Rome. Aside from the big name stores, a lot of street stalls popped up, as the sun went down, selling some delicous street food and lots of cheap gloves, coats, bags and the like. The area also has lots of phone covers, K-Pop swap cards and gifts to take home that are sometimes required when you’ve taken a holiday. You should be able to kit out the relatives and friends, co-workers etc. here while also buying some quality stuff from the Doc Marten or Adidas or other named brand shops. If you must go shopping this is a pretty painless place to do it. "
Good shopping area,Its a good shopping area. Many shops for Korean cosmetics can be seen here. There are lot’s of other stores too for shopping.Lot’s of street food stalls can be seen. One can enjoy all kinds of Korean food here. It is a very crowded & lively street.
Must visit attraction ,Walked along the streets. A must visit location. Good streets food. However quite expensive. Clean area. Full of cosmetics shops and most of the time pack with visitors
Busy Area - Shopping Mecca for K Beauty,"We stayed in the Myeondong area and selected out hotel based on the proximity to all the K Beauty shops. You will find at least one store front for every brand you desire. Also, Lotte Duty Free and Shinsegae Duty Free are here as well.At night there are stalls and stalls selling street food. It gets so crowded you can barely walk. I didn't like the cars being able to access the same road. I wished they would make it pedestrian only."
Bargain,"Lots and lots of bargain. We got some pair of Adidas Stan Smith at ₩59,000 per pair or around US$55 only."
Cosmetic paradise,If you're into makeup and stuff. This place has every possible Korean brand you can think of to stock up or replenish your makeup.It's a street food paradise at night and has several good cafe and food located all around the area.
Myeongdong for the Soul ,"Ideal place to stay. Food, shopping all in the same place. Kyoja, BBQ, fried chicken, ginseng chicken.. Making me hungry again. "
If you're into night markets and people watching,"Myeongdong is well-known for its street food and shopping and we were keen to experience what is unique about street food and shopping in Seoul. There was no shortage of: - restaurants (chimaek, bingsu and otherwise ... cheese hot pot anyone?),- street food stalls (selling the same food items, what turned us off were the dumplings which was bulk-packaged more so that the touristy prices), - cosmetic shops (if you miss one brand, fret not, there are potentially a few more down the street)- souvenir shops (whether its S.Korean snacks, life products or clothing/apparel) Despite the atmosphere and abundance of what was stated above, it felt somewhat materialistic and unoriginal compared to other shopping streets in Seoul. Perhaps come for a quick stroll otherwise there are better areas to explore in Seoul that are also friendlier on the wallet."
Shopping mecca,this place is all about SHOPPING. you can get anything from here. lots and lots of makeup though. they offer freebies for you to get inside the store. once your there they would definitely be in your face for you to buy and buy. soo beware. the temptation to buy another pair of lipstick is just too great. but overall it was a nice experience to try when your in Seoul. visit it amd see for yourself. 
Great shopping experience!,"Myeongdong is perfect if you're looking for good places to shop and eat til you drop! It's especially great if you're into kpop as they have an abundance of shops rammed with kpop cds and merchandise. Food is reasonably priced, and street food is delicious! The cathedral is also worth checking out. There's a great vibe in the area, and the shopping centers are also lively and great for high end goods :)"
Dominated by cosmetic store,"If you are not in for cosmetic, you can give this place a miss. Otherwise, it is an great place for shoppers with everything in a street."
Facial products galore!,The place to go for all facial products you need! You can of course get it elsewhere too but it's a hotpot of all the brands you will know of. 
Must go when in Seoul ,"You can find everything in this shopping paradise, but wait for around 4 pm when the food stalls open and taste a variety of fantastic Korean Street food! "
Used to be better,"Great place, especially at night if you don't mind tons of people. Used to be so much better, still have memories of good old Myongdong. Now it's flooded with tourists and locals, shops are mostly Korean cosmetics (Etude House, Nature Republic, Skin Food, etc.) and popular international brands, not so much of Korean clothing or accessories. Street food is hugely overpriced. Again, the main problem is that it's too popular and too crowded at night. Daytime, it looks like any other street in a Korean city. "
Loads to buy,"This is basically where you can do all of your shopping at. There are so many shops selling skincare, masks and cosmetics but the crowds make this place a little too overwhelming at times. As it was snowing in December, the ground was very wet and slippery so it was a bit cumbersome having to watch out for dried ice on the ground. The atmosphere was nice on the whole but you would have to take care not to overspend here."
Excellent street food,Myeongdong is a great place for great street food and shopping for young adults. Kids loved going there for the twisted potato and the 32cm ice cream. The street market usually gets setup around 3pm and is open till late. The vibe in the area is great. Must visit place in Seoul. 
Great for last minute souvenir shopping,"The entire street is packed with the bigger Korean brands that makes it very easy to grab souvenirs for friends back home. A lot of service staff here are Chinese, so language-wise, apart from Korean this is an alternative. Very crowded and touristy though, don't expect to come here to experience the ""real"" Seoul! "
Want face mask or Comsetic,"This is the place for all ladies to young girls. You can find all types of House own brand to world class brand in Myeongdong. You will never want to leave this place early after your shopping. Because there is plenty of nice street food after dark or before 5pm. I should say. This place is so lively from morning to dark. Do your homework first before searching for your products. Otherwise, you will feel lost in there. Too much to choose from. "
A great buzz,"Can be crowded but a good place to hang out. Maybe not as fashionable as several years ago, and has a lot of competition now for socialising and shopping. Have bought watches and clothes there. Walkable to and from many places, and a subway station too "
Avoid especially with kids. Better service at Hongdae,"Was there on 18th Dec to look for gift packs. Sales personnel was not interested to entertain questions on products. They were eyeing customers buying in bulk and did not bother to give samples due to sales period. One shop even attempted to keep the special gift packaging for the products i bought. When i insisted on it, got is reluctantlyStreets were packed and the little one got hit by back packs a few times. Street vendors were pricey.... KW3,000 for a small baked potatoe!Sales personnel at Hongdae was more pleasant and have the time to explain product details and happy to give sample."
Leisure wife fav country.,Look for Beauty of Corea in myeongdong subway shops for cheaper n more varieties of facial products. The Ahjussi is such a friendly Ahjussi. My wife spend lots at his shop everytime.
"Lively, full of food and shopping choices ","Highly recommended for a snapshot of the food and shopping choices that Seoul offers. There are food carts, local food restaurants and lots of international choices eg Nepal There is also a wide range of shopping choices, from the really inexpensive to the end. A must go if you are on vacation!"
Lively place,"We were there on Christmas eve. The street was full with street food vendors & it was very crowded but everyone was minding their own business. It’s a very lively place and loved the walking on this street, never felt unsafe. "
Love Shopping ,Lots of shops that offers great deals. But mostly I enjoy the street food. Clean and the atmosphere is very lively. There is a cat cafe too and my kids went twice and enjoyed them! 
Recommanded visit,It is recomanded to take a tour around the streets. A lot of shopping and nice environment including street food and restorants - big market. I was in Uniqlo and buy some products where they provide imediately tax refound. Go for it.
Street food heaven!!,"You have to try various street food in Myeongdong. So many different types of food, mostly cheap. Wonderful and happy experiences just walking by and browsing!"
Night Market in Seoul,Very nice Night Market with lots and lots of food variety. Almost everything is available here with lots of variety. Its basically a Street market and bargaining can be done for shopping. 
Great shopping!,Recommended for those shoppoholics. Everything in one place! Skin products everywhere but also restaurants and clothes.
Shopping Heaven for Beauty Lovers!,"Here is the place for every beauty lovers...you can see the famous beauty brand names like Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Etude House etc everywhere! There were malls like Lotte Mall & Shinsagae also for those who are into high end stuff. We love this place...easy to get halal food to eat. There were a lot of things you can shop here from souvenirs, day to day stuff etc. You can't miss visiting this place if you are in Seoul."
Nice place to visit,"A nice place to visit and buy souvenir, a lot of street food and some of the are halal for muslim. A lot of cosmetics item to buy. Dont forget to visit the cat cafe and the hello kitty cafe there. "
Heartbeat of Seoul but too many repeat stores,"Myeongdong is the mecca for skincare and cosmetics for shoppers who crave for masks and beautiful skin. If you are looking for something unique or creative, this not the place for it. However, here you enjoy the vibe of being in Korea and feast on its array of street foods. However, I would not just eat anything as the quality that can be dubious. Generally, the steak there is the best while the other street fare is just mediocre. "
Food delight,"If you're a budget traveler like me then better go to this area. Trust me anything you want to eat you can find in Myeongdong. Delicious and yet affordable. But when shopping for souvenirs, then i recommend Insadong. Its much cheaper there and many unique and authentic things to choose from."
Good walking street,"When you visit seoul, this is the another place, you must visit. It is like siam square in Bangkok. But at night there are heap of food stalls along the street. You can grab any foods, snacks as you like. There are some good restaurants and Bar for groups of people. A good time to visit is from 17.30-21.00pm. "
Worth a visit,"We've been to Myeongdong before and still find it interesting with its F&B n shopping. Especially when one goes during the cool seasons nice walk for sure. Street food rice cakes, fried chicken, ginseng chicken soup, BBQ,caramel pancakes, Dragon beard candy (must try w/almond my preference) yummy! Fresh Strawberrys at low prices in season. Hahaha. Worth a visit foe sure."
Less crowded due to lesser prc tourists,Went there 2nd week of Dec 2017 and my 3rd time visiting Myeongdong. This time lesser crowd and easier to navigate. Really enjoy it to the max !
Vibrant,"Great great great. But if u come in winter all are winter clothes. Because i come from a tropical country, i didn’t shop for clothings but other things else..A must GO! "
Great place for shopping,"The place is really great for shopping especially for fashion shoper. As the place has many famous brands here local to international and the products are from foot to toe also this place offering the Korean culinaries, that is become the place is very special for the tourist.One stop shopping for everything, really really really great.You can’t amazing this? Please come to Myeongdong okay , cheers"
Enjoyable maze!,"There are many restaurants and food peddlars here. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious! There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
"Very much a tourist hotspot, a lot of street food options. ","For sure there's tons and tons of places for you to shop for yout skincare requirements. There's a huge Olive Young where you can get almost everything you need there, as well as Boots. Some shops will treat you better than others, and most shop assistants would be able to converse in Chinese or Japanese but very very little English. Usually if I need to buy stuff, I'd come early, like 10am or 11am, when it is less crowded. 4pm onwards, and the people starts coming in droves. Food options are aplenty, but I feel the food is bit overpriced and underwhelming in the two shops we tried. The small Cafe's are pretty worth a visit though. "
"Great for Skincare Shopping, But Street Food not so much","Great for Skincare and Cosmetic Shopping! You can find any make-up/ mask you want in the area and it is much cheaper! Street Food was overpriced compared to other areas, and the taste was only mediocre."
Only cosmetic store left,The whole area is just filled with cosmetic shop and a few foot wear shops. I donlt really enjoy to shop there.
Shopping haven,The great place to shop and enjoy street food in Seoul. The best time to enjoy all of that is started at 6 pm
Great place for skin care shopping,"This place is very famous for its skin care. It's so much cheaper. And if you buy a bunch of skin care, please ask for their sample."
Lots of face masks,"This place sells face masks and street food. Some of the brands are: innisfree, beyond, holika, nature republic, the face shop...many more . Also, the famous sandwich place Isaac is nearby. There’s a lot of street food ☺️"
Interesting and exciting shopping experience!,"Many skin care products boutiques in Myeongdong area and almost every street in Myeongdong, you can find at least an outlet of the the common brands such as Etude House, Innisfree, etc. Most of these brand has many indoor promotions on their items which changes almost every week. It was interesting to walk along the street as many of these boutiques promoter will give free mask or samples to attract passer-by into the store. And many free skin care samples were given when you purchase items from them."
Love Myeongdong,"I love love love Myeongdong! All it’s stores, the night market and the streetfoods!!!! I cant wait to go back here as cold as it was when we were there it still was so super enjoyable!"
Chaotic but fun!,"Too crowded at night and weekends but you will never get hungry while you are walking along the street though :) korean streetfoods everywhere! :)And too much cosmetic shops trying to make you go inside their shops :)And what I didnt understand was, why was Myeondong street colder than most of the streets we went too and its even super crowded! "
Crowded but has a lot of good deals for shoppers,"Place is crowded but beautiful. Has a lot of restaurants, clothing and beauty stores that offer great deals, souvenir stalls and street food stalls. Street food here is a little bit more expensive. K-Beauty fans will enjoy shopping here (I did!)"
A place to spend time either with or without money,"A lot of shops of all variety, restaurants, 7-11s, stalls by the roadside. It is best to stay nearby so that you can easily commute to places in Seoul either by foot or MRT"
Nice place,Great for street food lovers like me..and the food is just awesome..certain things in the street you can find it cheaper in the subway station shops etc souvenirs..
Shopping ,Most people will go there for shopping. Check out the little alleys. The street food is an attraction by itself l..
Must See and Must Shop!,The energy of this place is incredible! So much to see and experience. So much to buy and much more to buy! Make sure to go by at night time when all the food carts are lined up too!
Good street food,They have lot's of good street food vendors among all the beauty stores. There are several department stores nearby.
Busy night market,Worth a visit. However the street food and souvenirs are more costly. Great place to get beauty products and get many freebies
More good shopping,"OK, I like to shop. I rank Insa-dong my favorite, but this nearby quarter is good as well, and since it's a short walk away, why not wander it as well?"
Good place for trying seafood ,Lots & lots of Seafood options. Scallops with cheese were yummy. If you love seafood....this is a place to be. Variety of shopping also available. 
Street for eat,"Despite the cold wintry Dec weather, managed to enjoy this street with the various eats! Want to change money?- head to alleys near the China Embassy. Want to look for a short rest stop - head to ""Inn-is-free""....great eco ambience. Just buy something to eat or drink lah."
Place of Korean MakeUp/skincare heaven ,"Every few step, you’ll find an Etude house, Innisfree, face shop, laneige. It’s basically the heaven of Korean MakeUp and skincare shopping. All of the masks are on permanent discount as well.Contrary to believe, they are much more stingy with samples already.Most of the sales assistance speaks Korean, Chinese or English. Will definitely recommend coming and stocking up on masks. Need an entire day to shop here. "
Excellent exchange rate at myeongdong,"Found this place off the myeongdong shopping street no 2.Look for #43, go inside the corridor and the counter right inside the building. The exchange rate very close to the bank rate.Look for pictures that I attached tosee building of currency exchange."
Good shopping place,You can find everything in a small place. Branded clothing as well as local sellers will be on the same street.
Busy but must visit,"Myeongdong shopping street is very busy with lots of shoppers, but other then worldwide brands it also has lots of market stalls with local street food and clothes for sale, you should definitely check it out "
A must in Seoul,"This is definitely one of the best places in Seoul, the street is just full of energy, you can get to feel how active Seoul is.The street offers endless options of shopping stores, both delicious and cheap street food, a true paradise for the gourmands among us :)"
Good for shopping & meals.,The best shopping place & eateries in Seoul. Prices are cheaper than other markets.Close to Lotte Mall. Many train stations available. 
Great Shopping,If you are looking for skin care or beauty products this is the place to go. Lots of great shops and plenty of food. Would come back!
The reason i visit KOREA twice,"I can spend hours just to walk around and visit every shop. Too much attraction in here. The food street definitely good, all of it. And if you want to buy some snacks, you may visit the LALA MART, it’s has the cheapest price so far and you may find anything there. Korean cosmetics, yes you may find all the cosmetics brand here, etude, innisfree, nature republic, the saem and so on. If you have enought time, you can visit more than one store of etude in here because in my experience they have different stock on each store. Myeongdong also a place for sneakers hunt :) besides the ABC mart, there’re some other sneaker stores. Also, it has the big LINE store with the huge brown doll in the front of the store, where you can take photograph but you have to stand in the provided queuing line first. "
Street Food,"I don’t usually like shopping streets. Shopping is not in my DNA.Myeondong Shopping Street was for me more of an eating street with plenty of roadside stalls, than shops.I tried the lobster - nothing fabulous. Can skip.Egg bun was delicious!Children found the sausages too peppery.Strawberries were incredibly sweet.But I had to say that my spirits were dampened by the sight of a disabled man crawling on the streets. It was a pitiful sight and I wonder why there weren’t more people who donated?"
The most happening place in all of Seoul,"This is THE MOST happening place in all of Seoul, where crowds in their thousands, local and tourists, throng the area picking up goods, cosmetics, street food etc. Your senses will explode with the vibrant music emanating from the various shops you pass by. Do note though, that street food prices aren't exactly cheap vis-a-vis what you can get at the restaurants, but hey, you are in Myeongdong, so just do it!"
Nice street with lots of food,"Nice street, lots of food however a lot of common stalls. And the weather in Dec is cold to be on the streets if you r not dress for winter. "
A must go in Seoul,"My favourite shopping area. Shoes, skincare, street foods, snacks, clothes, etc. You can find almost anything here."
Jam Packed with shops and restaurants ,"This is the place to come if you want to feel the hustle and bustle of the city! Lots of facial masks, clothing, roadside food stalls around here. "
So many skincare shops... ,"My daughter loves the area, I don't mind it either... Always vibrant and fun with some interesting street food. The restaurants in the area are hit and miss, so I have stopped eating there and move on to get food. "
Favourite shopping area,"I think Myeongdong offers a bit of everything; exciting, varied stores, the cultural, beautiful cathedral and entertainment galore. Shopping options are endless from the big brands to lovely small iconic individual stores. You can buy any electrical or clothing or handmade item along tyese streets and of course makeup."
Fun shopping ,Fun shopping place. A lot of activities going on but we went mostly toward evening time. So not sure if it’s the same during the day. Street food. Lots of beauty and cosmetic brands can be found. There are restaurants and also cat and dog cafes to keep the young ones entertained. But dog cafe will only allow older kids (8 and above) to enter. We had a lot of fun. 
Cool place,We like the green coffee house. Shopping is nice and fun but clothes is not cheap in Korea. We had fun.
a true gastronomic experience,one of the best must go to places in Seoul! merchandise abound as well as street food of all sorts from lobster to shrimps to scallops!!!! the choices are endless! go there when your hungry and carry lots of money!!!! ill be coming back soon!!!!
Streets of skincare shop and Korean food,"It’s a place to go for various Korean food it’s like one stop center where u can shop for various skin care product plus the famous restaurant. A must go at Seoul, better if u stay nearby. "
Suited for Chinese and Japanese visitors,"This place is rather suited for Japanese and especially Chinese tourists, with cantonese menus and signs in the street. Street foods are nice and fun, but the price is relatively very high and they don't accept credit card payments. Still a fun place to visit."
The Market that you must visited in Seoul,This is the market that you must visited in Seoul. Dont miss it because you gonna love it and will miss it when you leave Seoul.This is a very unique market with many delicious foods that they offered. You never imagined to find rare food elsewhere and you will love it. Other than food they offer also many unique things. This market is an example of a success market in attracting tourists all over the world. Visit Seoul and you must experienced this Unique Street Night Market. Never miss Myeong Dong whenever you are in Seoul.
I love this place!,"For those who are into shopping, Myeongdong is perfect for you! From cosmetics and make up to garments and apparels, you can get it in Myeongdong. The prices are from cheap to okay, but you can haggle, except maybe on cosmetics and beauty boutiques, but they always go on sale. you can also find some tasty street foods around. "
Great place for shopping,"Many shops and restaurants in this pedestrian area from local Korean to foreign international brands, nice place to walk around with many side streets and attractions to visit. "
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"When we visited Korea last Oct I browsed thru the internet about the best area to book a hotel and Myeongdong is on top of the list. Yes it exceeded my expectations. Not only the neighborhood is alive, everything is there - from traditional Korean restaurants, bars and most specially street foods to the hundreds of make-up stores, clothes, shoes, food and accessories that you could only get in Korea. What more a lot of sales are at stake when you visit this bustling street. We were there on the Golden Week and it's a public holiday in Korea but Myeongdong is an exemption although there are stores closed a lot are very open and people from all over Korea are there eating, drinking and shopping. The street is also very safe but just be ready to squeeze in to heavy crowd. You could also Myeongdong via one of Korea's largest station - Myeongdong Station. Just FYI if you need disability access need to locate the Elevator so this station is not readily accessible - a lot of stairs and escalators and not frequent. In the station itself there are a lot of food stalls and shops to buy at your own covenience. The street also connects to Namsan Park where the famous N Seoul Tower is located as well as the enchanting and holy Myeong-dong Cathedral. Our hotel is located near the Namsan Park exit of Myeong-dong in the Seoul Animation Center. Another tip is the walking so better prepare your feet for a good sightseeing. Truly I enjoyed my stay here so it's definitely worth a visit!!!"
Must visit in Seoul,Lots and lots of facial product stores to check out. Get free facial masks that are given out as free samples. Many food stalls selling all kinds of local delicacies. Many restos also to choose from. Must visit when in Seoul.
Women will go Gaga there ," if you are crazy about the make up and cosmetics , I think you are in heaven ... a great place also to experience Korea’s most delicate and creative street food."
Just one 'no good' dining experience,"A shopping paradise lined with restaurants, street foods, beauty product, sports & fashion shops. Free masks & samples giveaways have been largely reduced but you can still shop around for the best bargain. On our first night, we dined at one of restaurant on the 2nd floor which showcased ginseng soup & chicken stew. Big Mistake. The food was bland & tasteless. Service was rude & the crew keeping pushing us to order more dishes with larger portions. When we decided to order medium portion which turned out to be more than enough for the 4 of us, the staff sneered while taking our order. We noticed there were no locals dining at the restaurant, all were tourists lured by the pretty signboards downstairs. On our remaining days in myeongdong, we tried other restaurants in the vinicity & enjoyed great dinning experiences. Just this one that we did not enjoyed. "
Cosmetic Paradise,"A lot of cosmetics brands here, but some of them you haven't ever been heard before.Cheap price. Good place for who loves Korean cosmetics."
Shopping Heaven,"This area is always crowded. We visited Seoul during Chuseok holiday and thought it would have a smaller crowd. Well, we were wrong! Even on Chuseok holiday, it was filled with people. Myeongdong is a shopping heaven for women. There were beauty shops, clothing stores, shoe stores, accessories, specialty shops, a few men shops, restaurants and lots of food carts. I love the food carts the most. Beware of beauty shops that sells mask as they lure you in to make massive quantity of face mask purchases. We were victims of one of the shops there. Long story short, just be careful! We got a lot stuff from Myeongdong. However, the prices weren't cheap. We got some stuff cheaper from Hongdae and near Ewha Womens University."
"Great for women, not much for the guys but street food","Nice street to walk down and do some shopping. Some of the cafes and restaurants are pretty good and are good value. Check out the Myeongdong Koja. It's really good value/proportion noodles. Street food was also fun to try. I liked the deepfried fish cake covered sausage/cheese, etc. stall. Not much shopping for guys. Nice place for women and couples. Ther're some neat shops to check out though so I wasn't bored. Just don't expect to buy too much as a guy."
Shopping Paradise,Another shopping paradise in Seoul. You can find almost everything here. There are so many store for you to choose and so you can compare the price for a similar product to get the best price. You need to be intelligent shopper here because the price for a same product may be vary with another place offering the same product in other store.
great place for street food and shopping,Happening street every night. A lot of street food and restaurants. Must visit this place if you visit seoul.
Shopping paradise,"It is nice street to sight seeing and purchase fashionable items. There are many shops that build closely one another. Its ""make-up"" paradise for girls and women.Less option for Men.."
Shopping paradise,"All kind of stuff can find here. But not cheap, compare with dongdaemun . Must be intelligent shopper. No negotiation here. What i found out there, Uniglo sold the cloths more expensive then malaysia. "
"Many shops, lots of peipke","Many nice shops, but beware of all the people! In the evening the streets turn into food truck-Mecca with many nice flavors. "
I’m not into beauty products so it is just a place to go and have street food for me!,Lots of big department stores and small stores too! Most are selling beauty products which is not my thing. Great street food all around and had fun trying most of them too. 
Brilliant Vibe!,One must not miss this shopping street. The vibe in this area is exhilarating! Best way to enjoy street food while shopping around for their some facial mask
Must Visit,"Nice ambience with a lot of street food. Spoilt for choices when it comes to shopping for clothes and beauty products.Try to go in the evening, that's when the street food vendor start their business."
Favorite Place in Sepul,"I spent many nights in Myeongdong while I was visiting Seoul. They have tons of shops, food carts, and restaurants. It’s one of the busiest and most crazy places I’ve ever been and I loved it. "
Great shopping haven,Good place to shop especially if u r looking for streetwear n korean facial products. Lots of cafes and nice authentic korean cuisine restaurants too. Remember to visit in the night where the streets comes alive with lots of street vendors.The beauty products store assistants can be aggressive to pull u into their shops at times. Be firm!
Best shopping paradise!,"Shop till your arms break! The skincare and cosmetics are definitely the cheaper than anywhere else! Buy your cutie socks here as well! 10 pairs and 1 free for 1000 won. As for skincare ans cosmetics, you notice they repeats after awhile. But NOTE! Not all same brand has the same offer. Some do not provide on the spot VAT and some hace their own in house promotion.. So if you think it is cheap just get it first. Also try to look for shops that does VAT on the spot to save you the trouble to go to airport and do the VAT. Hope it helps and have fun shopping! "
Food stalls,"Great atmosphere and choices! We had the glass noodles, spicy rice cakes, sweet potatoe, fermented honey and nuts and more noodles! Something for everyone!"
Cosmetics and Food Everywhere,"You cannot go to Myeongdong and not visit its famous shopping street. It's lined up with lots of boutiques and restaurants. Tourists and locals alike flock the area. There are also lots of good street food but watch out, prices of a quick bite easily stack up and you'll usually find eating in a restaurant instead is cheaper.When buying cosmetics, I suggest to buy in bulk so you can take advantage of the tax refund."
Browsing the Modern stuff,"Nice place to browse and shop, street food here is excellent, many bars and restaurants also available. Clothing prices often the same in different shops, reasonable selection of international brands."
Myeongdong Food and shopping street,"This is where the tourist pulse in Seoul beats the hardest. And why not, it has everything. Walking distance to some of the city’s attractions like Deoksugung palace and Namsan Tower. It is replete with retail shopping, cosmetics, streetfood, and the latest in K-fashion and did I say market of Namdaemun? You can go underground shopping, do hotel bar hop and feast endlessly on Korean dishes whatever suits your budget."
Myeongdong,"lots shops and restaurants in the Seoul, Korea. You can find anything you want from food and clothes. "
Shopping and food,If you're around Jung-gu or Chungmuro area and looking to see what the night market is about. Take a short walk to this place. There are tons of shopping and plenty of restaurants. If you're adventurous grab something to eat from the street vendors. 
Girls it is Mecca of Cosmetics,My wife went out and bought enough of skin care products to last a while in just an hour. She is not a cosmetic person. Worth a visit for ladies. Prices and variety is the main reason. 
Not for me,"Interesting to see, but not for me. Loud, touristy, expensive (at least the street food), cramped. If you like shopping and kpop merchandise, you may like this!"
Best place to get street food,This is the best shopping street to get street food even the halal one. The hawkers speaks English well so no worry about that. It lively in the day and even better at night. This is the best place to haul all those Korean makeups as well.
 Good place for shopping and street food,"Lots of international fashion brands. Countless shops selling facial and skin care products. The street market and food stalls open around 4pm to 10pm. You can find interesting food and snacks here. There are many street stalls selling clothes, toys and fashion accessories. "
Lots of shopping,This shopping area was good. It had lots of skin care stores and many large retail chains. Insadong had more boutique and art shopping. Myeongdong had unbelievable food vendors come out at night. It was fun to try all the food. If you are looking for the famous Korean skin care products this is your place for sure!
Great way to spend the day in Seoul,"If you want a touch of home for the day while staying in Seoul this is the place to go. When I mean home , a little American enclave as practically every store you would find at a mall back home is in this shopping area. Also, there are plenty of eating options if you are tired of eating local food. That being said , there are still lots of great local restaurants and street vendors to fill up on while shopping. "
A touristy street ,This street is filled with tourists. There are many street food stalls and also many restaurants around this area. There are many shops selling cosmetics products at affordable prices. I would think this is a Must visit for any tourist for its food and shopping. Interestingly we cannot find a good souvenir shop for the basic memory keepsake which a common tourist would buy. Highly recommend: A street where you will be spoilt for choice of food. 
good ,lot of people .. kk nice sercvice and lot of shops . everything i can find from here . really good place for travelers . ♡ 
Overrated,It was so many store and people.Price is expensive compare to other places in Korea. You can get cheaper price for the same product in other places.Overrated.
The Seoul Experience,"The sights, smells, sound. It truly is an essential fabric of any visit to Seoul and would strongly recommend for anyone. Food is amazing quality, and obviously cosmetic stores are everywhere. Make sure you have Won though!"
Night shopping and street food,"I suppose this is the tourist go-to place for everyone. Tons of shops, bars and food options. Should visit here if you in Seoul for the first or second time. Other than that, it gets a bit boring and repetitive."
Cosmetics Hub,Local Cosmetics are easily available at a Great Bargain.Good Showrooms like H&M | Zara are also available. Main Dept Store - Lotte is also around this area.
Totally new shopping vibe,"You just don't get the Myeongdong vibe like you do here compared to the Western world. The lights, the street foods, free samples and the hundreds of people just give of a different and unique shopping experience. Definitely a must visit place when in Seoul"
Access to a lot of destinations,"Don't think it's only a shipping zone for Chinese people. There are lots of tourists destinations around. Nam San, Seoul city hall, cathedral, shinshaegae are all nearby. The surrounding area deserves at least two days walk."
Shopping + street food = happy tourist,It was fun going there. We went to a lot of make-up shops to buy the things our family and friends requested us to buy. I enjoyed checking and trying their street foods.
Cheap Shopping,Great if you want to find a bargain in clothes and accessories. Many shops selling cheap clothes from children to adult. Many nice uncles and aunties selling stuff. Some shops even open until night time as in 1am 2am. So much fun!
A good place to explore ,"It's a heaven for fashions and skin care products lovers.You can find almost all the Korean brand products here. We realized that the stuff Myeongdong are more expensive compared with Hongdae and that's why we didn't do any splurging here.As for foods there are a lot of choices, ranging from street foods to restaurants but again it's a bit pricey. "
Street Food!,"If nothing else, come to Myeongdong for the street food. Walk through the streets and try them all!! If you are interested, try entering shops and they might give you free stuff. Just take them :)"
Superbly amazing street,"You can find a lot of interesting items here, especially skin product Not only that, the street food are also amazing.."
Don't miss out,"If you are fond of street food, shopping and night strolls in busy markets, this is the place for you. Street food in Seoul has its own charm, it's not exactly cheap as compared to street food in Europe or US, but it's worth trying. Also being a vegetarian you will have decent options to choose from. If you love seafood, try the butter garlic shrimps here. You can easily spot some unique food stalls that can startle you with the food stall owner showing off his speed skills."
Shopping and Street Food,For both expensive and affordable (underground market) for shopping. CDs/socks/memorabilia of your fave actors you'll find it here. Street food stalls open after 3pm/4pm.Too quiet in the morning.
Shopping/street food heaven,"I absolutely love this place, it really comes alive after 14h (after the food stands have settled). Most of the stores have promoter with free samples to lure you inside, and have sales girls fluent in English and Chinese. Every weekend (Fri-Sun), most of the stores will have additional sales, so even though it will be swarmed, during the weekends you'll score the best deals. During my shopping, my boyfriend enjoyed himself with eating from all the nice food stands. Exit 2 of Myeong-dong station now also has a 8-floor Daiso, ideal for your gadgets, souvenirs and gifts."
great for shopping,"plenty of cheap things to shop for. there's a variety of cosmetic or skin care products, clothes, socks, shoes, souvenir items, etc. but its the street food that i get to love. i should say its a must visit place for tourists especially during night time. a lot of money changers in the area too. near bus stops and the Myeongdong Cathedral."
lots of things to see and buy,Nice place to visit. lots of street food to try and things to sell. so many bargain items to buy and bring home to family and friends. allot half day from afternoon to evening for shopping and food tripping.
Bustling with people ,"A heaven for makeup junkie or k-beauty lover out there! You can easily spend thousands here before you even realize it there are rows and rows of beauty store and most them have attractive offers you can't resist.

Various brands have different outlets around the area, salesperson will be luring you in with promise of free samples and products, the area is loud and crowded and alive and I love it! The street foods are not too bad either."
must visit for a shopping lover,"Great place for shopping cosmetics, they give you direct tax refund for some minimum purchase, there are tourist information staff you can easily ask if you need some information. The best part is you can ask for more free sample!!!"
such a crowded place ever,"It is a long street of all kinds of shopping. You can find big brands to street brands all the way. A lot of restaurants and eateries there so it might get you lost easily. There are Uniqlo Flagship, Lotte Department Store. HM and Zara name a few. Street food looks amazing and hundreds of cosmetics shops are there that you can buy cheap masks.

Ladies' Heaven,"It's ladies heaven here with lots of beauty and cosmetics stores around. Other that that, there's also lots of hawker stalls around operating till late."
The #1 street food and shopping destination for tourist,"This is the happening place for tourist especially starting around 6pm onwards with the lights on. Since the Chinese started coming around 3-4 years ago, street food options have multiplied. From the traditional fish cakes, dried squids,roasted chestnuts and corns to the more upscale grilled lobster, shrimp and scallops .....In addition to the name brand cosmetic stores, there are lots of side street with hats, clothings, handbags, accessories, etc at cheap prices. It is worth coming late afternoon to shop and snack your way up the Main Street in Myeongdong.Tips: don’t come too late. Vendors start to leave around 10ish. Best time to come is 4pm-9pm."
"Good Shopping Area, Street Food, Cosmetic shops, Zara, HnM","Good place to shop for K- Cosmetics, and they give Tax Refund Discount for any cosmetics you buy in that area. Crowded good street food, Try Galbi if you are meat lover. They have few souvenir shops too. Go to the alleys for more shops and restaurants. Its open till 10.30 pm at night where as the department stores close at 20:00 hrs."
Must-Visit in Seoul,"It gets crowded in the evening when the street vendors start setting up stalls. That's when the street came alive. Plenty of shopping opportunities if you like clothes and Korean skincare/cosmetic products. Check-out Innisfree, Misha, Faceshop especially... Great and affordable products! Too many food options to choose from at night. Just amazing! We stayed at Aloft Holel Myeongdong which is less than 5 minutes walk away. Super convenient."
Food and shopping heaven,"A very heavy tourist-populated place, the area is very accommodated to tourists having workers speak various languages (to some level of expertise).Plenty of food options here - price is higher than the markets but I guess it attracts the touristsDespite how packed it gets, I come here to shop as most places is immediate tax refund which I prefer - the tax refund at the airport can be tedious so having it being immediately done is A+"
Ladies... your wallet will be hurt,"if you're into beauty products, this is a heaven. even though there are a few similar chains of the same brands they give different discounts and free gifts."
Nothing mind-blowing,"Just street food that you can find in other streets. I bought a pollution mask with a smiley face on it for 5,000 won. That's about it."
Best shopping street in Seoul....,"Of all the shopping streets in Seoul, in our opinion- this is the best.Its huge, lively, great atmosphere, always crowded & have wide& good mix of products & food outlets. And it is centrally located in Seoul with easy access everywhere. There is a big & nice Lottle Mart nearby as well. We always stay here in our visit.For ladies, this is a paradise for cosmetics. All the Korean cosmetics brands are here. Each with multiple shops as well ( believe they are franchises as prices/promo do vary from store to store here). There are alot of street food & street vendors as well. Loved this place."
Street food!,"There are so many options of street foods along Myeongdong. We walked along once just to see what there was! We tried the twisted potato, the 32cm ice cream and a few other things during our time in Seoul. Great for a quick bite."
Myeongdong shopping.,"This part of downtown Seoul is quite the best area for shopping, with up-market, mid range and basic shops, with even 7-Eleven shops thrown in for good measure!There are eating stalls everywhere along the streets, and restaurants galore, catering to every taste.An absolute 'must' if visiting Seoul."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This area is incredible for shopping! There are so many facial beauty products available. Rows and rows of shops. The prices are affordable too! Look ahead of time to see if you can get the foreign traveller discounts for some shops - it will save you some money...and save some room in your luggage when you’re packing for all the stuff you’ll buy!
very happening area,a very happening area with numerous shops as well as stalls selling street food. A very lively neighbourhood and worth going just to experience the surroundings even if one has no intention to shop
Street food galore ,"Myeongdong is the best place to stay if you want access to street food and beauty road side shops till 11pm. Lots of restaurants too. Love the crowd, the vibe and interesting things to see. The area for people watching!"
Terrible experience for me,"I stayed in Myeongdong neighborhood because I was told it is the best in Seoul but I strongly disagree with that.Myeongdong wasn't that good for me, I prefer Hondae, Ewha university street, Insadong, and Itaewon than it, why? Because it's terribly crowded and dirty, I mean yeah I expected it to be crowded but to a certain degree.I couldn't eat in the restaurants there, I got disgusted by them honestly, I visited cats and dogs cafes there but when I saw the similar cafes in Hondae I really wished that I didn't do it in Myeongdong.Seoul is a crowded city in general but my point is, I hated that only in Myeongdong shopping street."
Vibrant,"The whole area and side streets are full of high end shops, restaurants, cosmetic stores, food street vendor. At night the food vendor experience is truly amazing, not only in flavours but also in optics. Food presentation is amazing and makes one want to try everything. "
"Three Things - Fashion, Food, Females","Myeongdong is the shopping paradise in Seoul, but it's not for everyone. Unless you're looking for shopping that appeals to women or for street snacks at night, you'd be better off spending less time here except for a cursory visit. The famous duty free emporiums are in the area as well, with Lotte and Shinsegae attracting even more women.Having said that, the place does have some interesting attractions too, it's within walking distance to the cable car up Namsan Seoul Tower, you can also visit The Cathedral Church of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception, or simply known as Myeong-dong Cathedral. The world famous Nanta Cooking Show (don't let the name fool you, it's not really about cooking) is a daily feature in the Nanta theatre at the Unesco building.So, do pay it a visit and see if you'll stay..."
Street food,"There are plenty of shops here and the area seems very safe/clean. Great atmosphere, but the most impressive thing was all the street food stalls that popped up at about 16.00 ish. Such an impressive array of high quality street food. Must have went to 7 different stalls in 1 go. Watch out though, there is room for bartering as they seem to up the price if they see u are foreign. Amazing food and very pleasant people. A must visit for the food alone. "
Best place for accommodation,"Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main streets meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Unlike Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores have branches here, including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices.A must see in Seoul."
Shopping & Eating Paradise,This is the best shopping & eating paradise. Everyday Myeongdong streets will start with long stretch of food stalls from noon till late night. We love to come here for shopping and foods. Their street foods are marvellous & cheap
amazing place for shopping and eating,myeongdong is a shopping mecca ...everything you need you can find here particularly Kpop merchandise..ive been to myeongdong 5 times during my last trip and i still end up buying a lot after each trip..the shops here offer a lot of discounts and freebies so one really gets enticed to purchase... myeongdong at night is different during daytime but both are worthy of visit. myeongdong has been used as location for korean dramas and variety shows and i got excited seeing those.... never leave seoul without going to myeongdong
a great city,the myeongdong street is a great place for shopping. a wide area for shopping malls and restaurants. street foods are also present everywhere. 
Many of the same shops located around the area,"This has got to be the cosmetic capital of Seoul. There are literally hundreds of beauty shops (many of the same) located throughout the area which can be confusing especially when you're lost. Lookout for the folks in RED are helpful guides who speak English who can point you in the right direction though. If you're Asian looking, the chaps outside the stores will try to speak Mandarin to you and lure you with their free samples. Do not resist the inevitable. Be careful that some areas have vehicular access. And try the street food. it's amazing. "
Must go for girls!!,"There are lots of shops selling facial product like laneige,innisfree,tony moly,saem etc and they do have lota of offer and the price are much more cheaper compare to my homecountry. You can also try their local street food here too. But it only start to open in the afternoon. There are choicea of restaurant in the area too."
A Multispeciality street!! From tick racks to great food!!,This street comes alive at night. You can get all sorts of stuff. From souvenirs to high end clothing!! Best part of the street is the the delicious street food one can get here. And the milling crowd at night with its multicultural hues makes it worth the visit! 
Busy shopping area,"My hotel was located about a 15 minute walk from Myeong-dong. It is one of the main shopping areas in Seoul. There are two main streets – one from Myeongdong metro station (line 4) and the other from Fuljiro which meet at the centre. The area is full of shops and restaurants, cafes and street food stalls.There are many shops selling cosmetics. This is the place to buy good quality cosmetics at reasonable prices. Branded designer goods are sold as well. I am always a bit wary of buying such goods at prices that are too good to be true.There is a big department store – Lotte Department store in this area. Prices for designer goods are more or less reasonable.Myeongdong also has a number of good restaurants. In addition, there are fast food restaurants as well as eating places serving Korean, Japanese and Western cuisines. Many restaurants in Myeongdong specialize in kalguksu (noodle soup). You will also find banks, theatre and beauty and hair salons."
Beauty products and streetfood,"If you want to shop, go to myeongdong.If you want to eat streetfood, go to myeongdong.Its a very lively place, there can be a big crowd in the evening. Still a must visit."
Too touristy,This place is too touristy that prices are double or more than other places. Food and beauty products etc. are readily available outside this area too at a cheaper price.
Awesome,"Awesome, fun, beautiful. Great night life, great for shopping.. would love it visit again. Best place for street food: Fried baby crab and Shrimp, cabbage egg omelette, scallops in butter and cheese, foot long cone ice cream, roasted lobster."
Busy,"Mix of international brands, Korean household names and market stalks selling everything you could ever need"
Definitely the highlight!,"Being a shopping trip of course, we have to do shopping! Masks and beauty products are cheap here, you can see big brands having several branches even just across the street, it may be confusing so do get a map before heading into the streets and alleys!The street food stalls are also really great as you get to taste the south korean street food while doing some shopping!"
Greta Shopping,Always crowded with shoppers jostling around looking for bargains and souvenirs amidst plethora of shops trying to outwit their competitors by promsing each one to use their cosmetic products and look most beautiful .Amidst them are street food vendors doing brisk business in evening hours .
Makeup free samples,"Shops give you free samples to come take a look at their items inside, just go look, no need to buy and you get to keep the free samples. You also get rebate if you pay more than 30k krw. So bring your passport. "
Not For The Shoppoholic,"Loads of brands, loads of choices, loads of items .... loads of street food and loads more. Its a combination of high street fashion and a street shopping for the common people. Latest fashion on apparel, shoes, tshirt, branded or even local items , all are here. If you are up for it, loads of street food traders will be just around every corner. Baked lobster, Baked Muffin with eggs ( this is my favourite item) and local korean street food are amongst the many many choices being offered here.As for cosmetics, it is a heaven for those who loves to shop for skin care, facial care and anything to do with make up. Women will definitely loves it here.Its a must if you come to Seoul , Korea."
Bustling,"Super bustling street that comes alive at night. Wifey spent loads of time in the cold browsing through the street carts of jewellery. Apparently, earrings at 1,000 won is REALLY cheap. Other than that, eat the street food and get all your beauty stuff along this area. "
Shopping paradise ,"On here can say that you have strayed into a shopping haven with the busiest streets there are many shops, especially cosmetic stores can discount program extremely attractive There are also shops for clothes and shoes are very nice and the price is also very good If the tired and hungry you can enjoy great street food or visit a cafe to rest Very excellent"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"We only had 2 hours to get some shopping so this was where we were brought to by our friends it was a fabulous place all lite up at nigh. there were so many small shops selling souvenirs of all descriptions and food sellers selling all kinds of snacks.But alas to all the Men out there this is a Makeup paradise for woman there are so many shops that are selling all sorts of products for the ladies, my wife was in her element.Luckily we managed to find we needed."
Helps to give some life to Seoul visit,"This street will help keep the visit to Seoul alive. The street has great shopping, whether it is street shopping or mall shopping. Street is filled with great local Korean street food - which are clean, hygienic and tasty. Never a dull moment walking along this street."
Great place to visit for make up ,"Do come here to try their street food. Ask about the price before ordering so that you won't be surprised. MUST TRY is the fried cheese rice cake selling at ₩3000 per stick. We ordered the pomegranate drink without checking out the price and was slapped with ₩7000. Seriously it's not worth!!The fried Mandu was good too. Good for sharing is the steamed corn with cheese powder sprinkled with plum. Do eat it while its hot. Bbq lobster was overly priced at ₩15000. Those with sweet tooth, do try their 32cm soft served ice cream and strawberry mochi stuff with red bean paste. The red bean fish shaped pancake is crispy and caramelized rough puff pastry. There are plenty of make up stores. Etude house has at least 5 outlets within the same vicinity. Innisfree has about 4 stores and 1 main double storey branch with a cafe. Prices at Myeongdong outlets are the same as other outlets in Hongdae. We managed to get better discount from Hongdae though. Ask about tax refund before you buy. Bigger outlets are able to do tax refund on the spot as long you spend ₩30000. More rebates will be given if you spend ₩50000. "
Place to visit 100%,You can spend here all day and still it wouldnt be enough.It is streets full of small shops offering all possible suvenirs and more.Lots of places to eat near by with local food.Dont miss this place it is amazing.
Make up heaven. Not for men!!,"It’s really good to come here at night. A bit crowded but it’s really fun. There were plenty of street food and a lot of make up shops!! And make sure to bring your passport to get tax discounts. Nature republic staff are so helpful,.Accessibility- bus from incheon is available.Safety- safe but too crowded.Must try- sunde!!! For girls,make sure you have enough luggage capacity coz it’s where you can buy cheap but good quality cosmetic and lots of free samples!!!!!"
City girl couldn't cope,I LOVE SHOPPING and live in a big city in the uk but I could not cope with the amount of people and shops however I did find everything I needed. Also side note boots in Korea is so expensive £8 for something the costs me £1.50 at home lol
Lively but just another shopping street,If you like shopping this is your place. I knew what Beauty products I wanted so I was in and out. Prices are cheap but I found other outlets or even in subway is cheaper. Kids really wanted the 23cm ice cream which we later realised you can't find anywhere else. So we had to come back to get it here. We ate in Lotte Mart. 
Shopping galore!,"Best place to eat street food and one of the best place to shop for clothes, shoes, make-up, socks, etch"
Perfect Place for Women,"You can probably call this as make-up or beautification heaven for women. Beauty shops in every corner, even with multiple branches for one store. Shopping for clothes, shoes and apparel can also be done here, but I would say, it has same price in the Philippines. So you should buy things that can't be found in the Philippines. The night food market is a different adventure in itself. You can taste all their street foods in this place, that will be you dinner already."
Crowded and a maze but exciting!,We went at night and the streets were quite crowded but the experience was nice. You can find almost anything to buy!
Freebies Freebies,"Better to go around 2pm onwards. street foods will just start to prepare by this timing.. you can enjoy both street foods and shopping...Tip 1: Dont buy on Mondays&Tuesday price are normalTip 2: dont get fooled of sale by wednesdayTip 3: thursdY is the best day to buy, %off are much higher compared pn wednsdayTip 4:with above tip you will assume friday will be the best day to buy. but its a big no no. Price will start again to get highTip 5: dont buy during sat and sun, price will go up again since its weekend.....So better to go shopping by thursday :) Happy shopping"
Great Shopping in Seoul,"This area is fun to walk around and offered the best shopping that I saw while on a recent visit to Seoul. The remarkable thing is that after a while, you're seeing the same 4-5 categories of stores (often you're seeing the exact same chain-brand store over and over e.g. Innisfree): cosmetics, luxury brand apparel, coffee, art/ceramics, kitschy souvenirs, and food. That being said, it's fun and a good place to wander and grab souvenirs."
Meet the locals,"The best way to have contacts with locals is walking down this main shopping street in the center of Seoul; here at least you will not see the classical shops you will find everywhere in Europe but all genuine shops where nearly everything is available, main things being ginseng and ... mobile phones of course."
Overrated ,"The most overrated shopping street in Seoul. It’s only great if you are a Korean beauty product & Korean big names fashion fan. There are many fancy street food at night but they overcharged. It’s 2-3x more expensive than other place. If you are looking for bargain buy and souvenirs, I would suggest Namdaemun Market which is just 15mins walk from Myeongdong."
Very lively,"As we stayed at a hotel less than 10 minutes away, we visited the shopping streets twice. The streets are hustling and bustling with lots of beauty stores, clothing stores and restaurants. We had BBQ, Korean dessert, then chicken and beer all in the same night. During the evenings there is also a small night market with some clothing vendors and mostly food vendors for a couple blocks. We loved walking around and people watching in the area. "
Fun engaging street ,"Beware of stalls trying to rip off your $ though. Otherwise u will find all sort of food, shoes, fashion staff here. Must see place when u visit seoul"
Most touristy part of Seoul we saw,Lots of free stuff if you are willing to be hauled into the stores by staff. Bring your passport to benefit from onsite duty free.
What a great place,"If your looking for something, anything, you will probably find it here. Huge variety of clothes, souvenirs and pretty much everything. Be sure to go into some of the buildings for lots more stalls and shops. Found they don’t barter much, maybe 10-20% but prices reasonable anyway. Leave enough time to explore. "
"OK street food and nice shopping, shop clerks hate you","Myeongdong is an amazing place for shopping (especially beauty products) and the evening vibe feeling is so good. There are banks if you need to withdraw money, tax free refund machines and counters so you won’t need to do in at the airport, restaurants and street food everywhere and very many people but no worries about getting pick pocked. However, most of the shop clerks (not street food vendors or street sellers) acted like I murdered their dearest pet and gave crap service. They barely gave response or tried to communicate, did not look at you when talked with, no smiles EVER. Imaging a shop clerk acting like you are a burden they are trying to get rid of. "
Tourist trap,"Myeongdong market street is the ultimate tourist trap in Seoul. Nothing is cheap here. But go to the backstreets and you may find some steals. Nothing compare to Hongdae prices however. Nonetheless, people still shop here for the experience that makes Myeongdong as a must go place in Seoul."
One of the must go places if u visit Korea!,If u 1st time coming to Seoul then u should stay around this area. Great atmosphere during night when there’s a lot of shops and stalls selling great stuffs and foods also! U can try all the street foods here while shop til you drop. 
Busy always,"If you like to see the crowd, this is the place. Shops are thd same for every corner. You can try street food in the evening."
Delicious Food,Street food is undefeated! Shopping is great. Watch out for the pharmacies! They will scam you! I purchased medicine that is by prescription ONLY in the USA from the pharmacies here. They are scam products. They don't work. I wouldn't purchase any products from the pharmacies in the airport either.
Street food,This shopping area is great for street food and skin care products but not too much else. They have several stores on the streets that are just repeated throughout the section. 
A maarket for beauty products and massarge,As Seoul's markets go it's OK but not great. Many beauty products with street food and clothes and shoes. Other markets are better but if close to your hotel it's worth a visit at night.
Good to shop,I shop at myeongdong almost every night for 5 nights. From fashion to skin care to food. I can get almost everything I want here. Especially lots of free gifts for skin products. Love this place sooooooooo much
"Nice street, crowded with people, lot of shops and food.","This is a good place to visit, especially if you like shopping and eating and to be around lot of people. Like in many areas of Seoul there is a great design all around and if you like this area at daytime you probably like it even more at dusk. The merchandise and prices? - I do not know, did no buy much except for something to eat."
Just another shopping street,This is just another shopping street with the big box stores. Nothing too special unless you are specifically going for shopping.
Good tourist spot at night,"Myeongdong area has lots of shops, about half cosmetics, quarter clothing, the rest are various other shops and restaurants. Everything is very close together, so you can comparison shop. The area comes alive in the evening and at night, as street vendors setup along the streets. The merchandise is standard night market fare, cheap trinkets and such. You will probably find better prices and selection at the Namdaemun market right next door, during the day, but much more crowded, rustic, and with less English. There are also street food vendors that setup at night, if you want to sample some portable local bite sized fare. "
Myeongdong Shopping,Brilliant The food is Outstanding Local Western Street Fine Fast Food it's all hereThe Lotte Supermarket Restaurants Shop Young and Trendy Branded Bargains are All here
Over-rated,"Over-rated is how I would describes Myeongdong Shopping Street. It's very crowded at night and on weekends. Make up store employees will chase to come into their store. There are Plenty of food vendors and restaurants but not all good. Food wise, food was okay, nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong, you can find everything at the Myeongdong Shopping Street and that is it. If you want to do shopping and grab okay food, then this is your place. But you want good shopping and good food, go to GoTo Mall (Bus Terminal) which is way better. And there is another mall that is next to the GoTo Mall under the Bus terminal. Better food better shops, No make up stores to bother you. And there is a Lemon mini supermarket in the Myeongdong shopping area, STAY AWAY. Their employees are rude and horrible."
Vibrant & Fun ,Came here every night during our stay in Chongmuro. The street food at night is great and the lobster tail s a must try. Lots of shopping day and night and plenty of currency exchange shops.
Good selection of street food but more touristy and expensive,"My hotel was right here so the street food was most convenient. It seemed to be the most touristy area and thus most expensive. They seemed to have more touristy foods like the chicken skewers, meat balls, fried chicken pieces along with some of the more traditional things. I think I liked the chicken skewers the most here. Go elsewhere if you are looking for more traditional stuff or cheaper food."
Not for everyone ,"Good: Tons of skincare and cosmetics choicesRestaurants, coffee, and Street food galore. Bad:Wall to wall people at night. NoisyFree for all for both pedestrians and trafficDepending on your personality, you'll either enjoy the lively atmosphere or hate the crowds and chaos."
Make sure you visit in an empty stomach,"We stayed nearby so we visited the shopping/food street almost every night during our 5D4N stay. There are plenty of food stalls available starting noon till evening, so plenty of choices to try out.If one is not keen of street food, there are also plenty of highly recommended sit-in restaurants. Do a general search on Myeongdong best food to fish a few restaurants in the area.The place could feel like a maze and sometimes every street could get rather crowded during peak hours.Nevertheless, it's a definitely a place to check out if you are in the area. It's also easily accessible via subway.There are also volunteers stationed at certain areas to help tourists with directions. They dress in red vests with various labels on so easily identifiable."
Loads of yummy food,My favourite street to walk and snack! Lots of yummy Korean street snacks and many cosmetics stores! 
Great Place to Get Lost,"Myeondong has several shopping stores and vendors for all tastes and ages. The street food vendors offer a variety of quick, easy, and cheap eats. There are a few high end places if you're looking for a proper sit down. However, eating on the go is much more fun. A must see area if you're around."
For food explorers and beauty product lovers.,"We thought Myeondong would be a bit overrated but we still put it down to our must-try food hunting list. No regrets. I wont deny it was fairly crowded but it was one experience worth going for.As fellow Muslim travellers, my husband and I managed to find few halal stalls out of many that is available. Although there were few non halal ones (selling meat) majority were just seafood and one selling halal kebab.We went twice and took our time to try them out while some were quite delicious some were so-so. I particularly love their sweet delicacies namely the sweet peanuts with eggs hot cake. However out of the two stalls i tried, one of it tastes better than the other. So look out for the ones that has more patrons, lol. The street is full of beauty product shops as well as clothes so you may want to check it out. These beauty product shops will always include sample giveaways too. Majority clothes were quite small but I manage to find bigger baggy tops to fit."
A galore of beauty shops and street food stalls ,"Myeongdong, where the night is always young. Somehow time stops as you troll the streets and lanes of beauty shops, fashion outlets and food carts. The bright lights, the food smell, the touters' chants, the hawkers' showmanship, the heavy human traffic - the experience is multi-sensory! Landmarks don't quite work here because there are dozens of the same beauty shops at every lane that the streets all look almost the same as you turn the corner. Worth visiting for the multi sensory experience but it doesn't mean the purchases (including the food) are gentle on the pockets."
Great for ladies to shop torture for men,If you want to shop for brand nane clothes or cosmetics this is your area. Tons of shops big and small. Mix in a nice sampling of restaurants and you have it. 
Great fun ,"Very easy to walk around, has all the main shops that you would want to find in easy walkable distances and best part of it is that it simply has a great feel to it. On the weekend and many week nights the streets are filled with food vendors so it’s great fun walking around having a local snack and taking in the sights "
"More shopping, and it isn't cheap ","I'm not a big fan of shopping in the first place. It is fun to see the busy streets full of people, but for Americans, the goods are very expensive. I must say, Seoul is a beautiful and clean city. The people are respectful and very well mannered everywhere we have been. Even in the busy shopping district."
Place to purchase beauty products,This place would be a shopping heaven for ladies who are fascinated with beauty products. There are many shops selling beauty products at a price that is way cheaper than Singapore. The are also make shift street stalls selling traditional Korean food at night.
Check this market out. Yummy food ,Great food. Street food vendors Only starts at 2 pm. Good selection and speak enough English to get by. Worth waking around this market. 
Interesting ,"We go there for street photography mainly, many cosmetic shops worth going and different brands shops. There is halal restaurant offers good taste"
Shopping,"Very good bargain shopping and also branded shopping,especially clothes and shoes.Too good for street food too"
Well...,"To be honest?!? Nothing special. You see these places,shops ect hundreds of times next to each other. They have the same stuff.. so really nothing special."
It's a cosmetic heaven,"You can almost find cosmetic shop in every steps you make. Cosmetic shop from alley to alley in miles away. All the Korea local brand is here. Korea street food heavenly too. Some western brand like Zara, Guess, H&M also available."
Vibrant with many places to eat and shop!,"This is the place to visit in the evening. We first went in the morning and found the shops just opening up and not many people mingling.We returned the following day but in the evening, and wow, what a difference. The lights are flashing, the street vendors are out, and numerous people from all over the world walking and enjoying each street and alley.There are restaurants on street level, on the second floor with elevators that open directly just to one restaurant, and of course street food! You can find everything from fish cake soup to lobster with cheese topping.You can spend more than 2-3 hours just walking around, visiting shops, and eating on the streets or in restaurants.We ended up visiting twice, and found each experience different. If you're not careful you can lose sight of which street you are in.This is a definite tourist destination if you're in Seoul"
Nights at Myeongdong Street,I love to stay at Myeongdong area because I love to spend my night walking around the Myeongdong Shopping Street. Lots of street food you should try here. So many cosmetic shop to look at. Believe me you will enjoy its too. Enjoy shopping here. 
Cosmetics shopping,"Probably best place for cosmetics shopping and try some street foodI'm sure the street food is only for tourists, because I didn't see such a thing in rest of the city"
Come here in the evening to have street food,"Myeingdong is perhaps the most popular tourist area in Seoul. It can be easily accessed by metro. The market is big with a few big shopping malls (Lotte, Lotte Young Plaza, Shinsegae), Zara, Forever 21, numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, snack bars, street food vendors and more. Most of the stores sell cosmetics, clothing, electronics. The street food is the major attraction. There are food vendors on both sides of the streets selling a vast variety of food. Some of the food you probably haven't seen before.Occasionally, you see 2 people wearing red uniform with an ""i"" in front. They are the ""information center"". They are extremely helpful and speak fluent English and can answer any question about the area. I don't see any public washroom in the area but you can ask the ""information dual"" to show you the way.The place is very vibrant and always busy. Just come here to be with hundreds of people is an experience."
"Shopping, street food, atmosphere","Fantastic area to shop, loads of good price restaurants to find (try the side streets or look up to the higher levels) or just buy loads of tasty street food! Mix of international and Korean brand shops- some of them sooo cheap, lots of skincare, beauty and fashion options.Really busy and great atmosphere, worth a few visits while in Seoul- in the daytime and at night!"
Alway good ,"It’s 2nd time we came it’s still good an enjoyable this street for food and shopping , love to come back ☺️"
wonderful place,Very good for shopping and sightseeing. There are many cosmatics store that always give you special promotion as buy 1 get 1 free.
Best Place Ever ,"For people who are looking to shop for skincare and food, this is for you! This area has all the Korean make up and skincare stores, MULTIPLE of them!! As well as very delicious street food. My favorite brands include Innisfree and CosRx for Skincare, and for food you can try the fried Gyoza and rose shaped ice cream. We were lucky enough to have stayed in this area! "
Overwhelming!,This place has so many shops selling similar merchandise that it makes one wonder how they stay in business. Be prepared to walk a lot as there is much to see. 
great for food and shopping,We went on a Saturday evening and the buzz and atmosphere was amazing. Lots of street food stalls and shops. 
Buzzing Place,"Busy place with street food stalls set up by evening, selling all kinds of food from lobster tails to skewers. There are many cosmetic and fashion stores selling good quality but affordable fashion clothes. A must for anyone loves shopping."
Great market street. ,Exciting street with many varied eating options of wonderful korean food.Market priced clothing. Great atmosphere
Spend that money,"An absolute must when in Seoul. I regret not knowing a word of Korean cause I would be bargaining. Not so big but full of beautiful clothing items. If I come to Seoul next time I’ll deff come back, cause I bought so much."
Cosmetics shopping heaven for the ladies !,"If you are on Seoul and looking to do some shopping, go to Myeongdong shopping district. Especially for the ladies, there are so many cosmetics shops , local brands who set up shop here. Think innisfree, nature's republic and the lot ! Go check out the latest Korean trends and fashion.Do try to haggle tho, and collect your free face masks, for your own personal use and if you have too many, it works out great as gifts to family or friends. And if you are a guy and was dragged along by your wife or girl friend, there are many cafes around the area. Try cafe gaya, you can drink your latte or sip an expresso while she shops. Just remember to bring check in luggage :)Alternatively guys you can always try the street food around the area for some great traditional Korean food.By the way, there is a Line Shop there, so guys be prepared to drink lots (and lots) of coffee. "
Doing shopping in shopping street,"This year i've visited South Korea second time.In this review, I'm gonna write about myeondong shopping street where has lot of modern brand stores and you can buy what suits you want. In this picture, i've with my friend who study in korea. We did shopping all day until we almost straved. There were crowded people to do shopping. After shopping, we ate korean cuisene that called samgebsel. They often drink some beer and soju(korean traditional alcohol) after eating meat. Of course, we followed their culture kkk. If you are planning to visit seoul, never ignore to do shopping at Myeondong. In my experience, it's gonna make you happy that doing shopping at all new brands street. "
Just a quick trip ,"I am european, but the shops are good value ( apart from electronics) but for the larger person there are no choices. "
Evening Snacks,This street is just full of excitement for a tourist who wants to shop or nibble on some fascinating snack's that is sold by the street hawkers. The shops are open till 10pm so you got plenty time.
Lively street with many vendors and shopping options,"I love Myeongdong Shopping street because everything is so close to one another that you can shop, eat and get a nice hair cut and make up too. Compared to the prices of department stores, shopping in Myeongdong costs much less. I also like massage place in Royal hotel. I think it's called spa Element. The staff, prices, and services are really the best. I also like hair shops there. Cheap and Chick"
Interesting shopping & restaurant area...........,"Myeongdong is a maze of retail stores, restaurants, and hotels in Seoul. Well worth visiting as a tourist to wile away a few hours wandering around. Amongst the Korean stores there are many western brands including Boots, Starbucks etc., while the small restaurants offer an affordable way to taste the local cuisine."
Good place for shopping,This district is very busy with shoppers. You literally can find anything here. Street foods are also available here.
paradise for the shopaholics and foodlovers!,i went there 2 times; once in spring and then summer! better go in spring ah.. coz mosly the food are hot! but again so many cosmetic shop and local brand distro! definitely favourite place for those people who love to shopping and eat street food! once i try the crepes with my bf omg. taste like bomb with melted choco and banana as the topping
Shopping shopping shopping,"Hundreds of shops mostly cosmetics and apparels! Lots of restaurants too so easy to grab food during your shopping. At night, there are street vendors that make the area livelier. Try those street foodS from skewers to local snacks and delicacies. Subway myeongdong station or euljiro 1. "
It is like Orchard road of Singapore ,"Great place for shopping and eating out,Night time there are food carts around too. Lotsa hotels around. Convenient."
Strolling the streets of Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is actually 2 subway stations away from Seoul Station and we were told that the shopping was good there. We actually found Myeongdong Cathedral and it's bookstore even more interesting. Worth spending half a day walking the streets, it's really interesting."
Good place to shop but not eat,"There is a lot to see and buy, can't finish in a day. You can find some similar items in different shops, so compare before you buy. Avoid taking free samples from cosmetics and skincare shops as most of them will literally pull you in to their shop and take back the ""free sample"" if you did not buy anything. Food in Myeongdong streets are mostly over-priced. Ask the price before purchasing food as some sellers would raise the price if they know you are travellers."
"Good shopping area, watch out for overpriced food.","Myeongdong is great for skincare and cosmetics shopping. A variety of eateries, however pricing is higher than a normal restaurant. I paid 55000w for breakfast of 3, which I only spent 25000-30000w at Chungmoru."
Boring and expensive,"Lots to see in this area but mostly all the same - clothing, street snacks, and cosmetic shops. It all sounds fun except almost all the products being sold are basically the same. Everything is more expensive than the rest of Seoul, so that was a huge turnoff for us. I would not recommend shopping here, a quick walk-through would do it if you've got time to waste. Families with children - watch out for large crowds and loud noises."
Skincare haven,"The place to go to if you're into skincare shopping. Instant tax rebates free if you bring your your passport and buy above 30,000KRW. Nanta theatre is also located there. Very busy area. Sample some street food as well as quaint cafes. You can also find lots of currency exchange shops there. Tourist information centers can be found in several places. Many hotels as well."
Nice shopping place,Many shops and restaurants open until 10 pm. Good place to spend time and look for best deals! Branded stores are also in the area. Bargain carts on the street like night market. 
Everything is here!,"Shopping for beauty products? Well there are at least 5 from where I stand. And they all beckon. Snail cream, animal facial masks, you name it. Packed a dozen or so. And those socks. Just had to get them for my wife, daughter and granddaughter!"
Great place for foods and shopping ,"There are lots of street foods along myeongdong and many places where you can have Korean BBQ. This place is ALIVE during late afternoon to late at night. Many small stalls selling foods, clothings , bags , socks etc These are the streets full of where you can buy really good bargains of Korean masks. "
Excellent shopping,"A very busy place with every imaginable shop. Loads of name brand shops, restaurants, coffee places and skin care shops. Very safe to visit at night"
Cosmetics and skincare heaven; good street food,"FOOD: Street vendors come out in the afternoon to set up their stalls. There's a wide range of local street food here(which I noticed is more prominent in the night scene and not so much during the day) so there's bound to be something that will suit your taste. It is kinda weird how people flock to this place early in the evening and at around 11pm, this place becomes more like a ghost town. Yup, the stores close early. If you're planning to come here to drink, this is not the best place for that. Go to Itaewon. There is, however, a narrow street in this area with a strip of bars that stay open till dawn.SHOPPING: Prices here are higher. I bought some socks near Ewha University for 1,000 krw each and was surprised to see the same kind in Myeongdong which were sold at 2,000 krw. Don't fall for the free samples. Store clerks would give them away to lure you inside the stores. Trust me, they really know what they're doing. Cosmetics and skincare products are cheaper here, since this place is where they come from. Lol. Look out for incredible deals especially those 50% discount and 1+1 promotions. Overall, this place is not bad at all. As a tourist, I enjoyed the atmosphere here and would love to come back soon. "
"If you love buying cosmetics, this is the place","Great place to buy cosmetics, period, and we will come back here only for cosmetics, period. Food wise I think is a bit over-priced and not all of them are my type of food but very interesting experience. Personally I love tornado crisp."
No more a tourist attraction.,"Do you want to buy a pair of Nike shoes, a cup of Starbucks coffee, or a can of Coca Cola at a 7 Eleven? If yes, this is a perfect place full of literally all local and global brands. This place used to be the only modern place 50~60 years ago, but now it is a place with terrible restaurants who rip you off. I would rather recommend you Gangnam, Garosugil, Anguk, Hyewha, and many other places. "
Good for tourists,Here you can find local food and scene as well as an international flavor (shops). It's targeted to tourists and so it's mostly busy with people.
Great for street food and people-watching,"Definitely worth a stop if you are traveling to Seoul. I had delicious street food there and enjoyed just walking around and soaking in the ambiance, with many restaurants, shops, and bars to explore."
Carnival Atmosphere @ Night! ,"Street food Korean style! Shrimp on a stick, BBQ lobster tails, buttered scallops, saucy rice cakes, tornado potatoes, dumplings, fruit juices, Korean pancakes, and more .... so much choice, good prices, tasty food! "
Interesting shopping market in Seoul,"Famous for cosmetic shops, they are frequent and repetitive. Good street food options, look for the rose shaped ice cream and foot high cone. It seems like there are more deals than Gangnam, but not as good as Others."
Once is enough ,It's a bit of a tourist trap here however worth going to for the street food. They have a lobster tail smothered in cheese which I returned to the area another day just to get it. It was pretty busy and shopping not so great. I suggest only going if you're a foodie. 
Great time on weekend nights,Love Myeondong and street food . Although I am not a shopper type these streets have a different character and a must do in Seoul. Go there after 7 or 8 pm.
Shopping time!,"From fashion items to kpop items to cosmetic products in the morning then, street foods by late afternoon 'til the evening, you better prepare your money to fly away."
Shopping Eating Haven,"Loads of places to shop and loads of places to eat. However, travellers be forewarn of shop salesperson who try to persistently put you face mask samples to you to enter their shops. And when you refuse politely after multiple times, they become extremely rude and ask you to get lost. "
Make up shopping,"Place to buy make up (woman things), many cafes and also restaurant. For muslims you can easily found halal food.In the night there's a lot of korean street food stall."
Love the street food,"While I'm not into the shopping here, I do enjoy the street food vendors stationed at numerous locations throughout the area. You can find some great treats on sticks. "
Too crowded,The whole area caters to tourists. Most salesgirls are able to speak chinese and some can be pretty aggressive. They have repetitive brands almost at every turn of the corner. The street food are relatively more pricey too because its a touristy place. The streets get so crowded that you often have human traffic jams. I stay there so it gets quite frustrating on my way back to the hotel...
Foodie,"A street perfect for foodies and shoppers. Plenty of street stalls and even shophouses such as Yoogane and other KBBQ places. After having your lunch/dinner, you can continue to shop cheaply at innisfree etc and get your tourist tax refund. Remember to bring your passport along."
A treat for your senses,"There is so much action in this area both day and night that you cannot possibly experience all of it. From late afternoon until late in the evening, the streets are packed with food and other vendors selling unique treats. We never tired of wandering the streets and experiencing the visual and taste sensations. It would be a huge mistake to visit Seoul and miss this area."
Amazing place,The place is crowded and has plenty of food. There is also a mall nearby where you can buy groceries. It is a must-see place if you go to Seoul. 
Too crowded and a bit overpriced,"This place is really a haven for cosmetic-buff. If you intend to buy or looking for a good brand with discounts then this is the place for you. Other than that i would skip the place. Other stuff like streetfood and clothes etc are over-priced compared to other places like Insadong, namdaemun market and bukchon hanok village shops."
Best street food in Seoul,If you want street food at night this is the place to be. So much variety and choice. Bustling with energy and atmosphere. Tons of cosmetic stores too for bargain buys. Gives a good sense of Seoul at night. It's much more subdued during the day.My favourite area in the city 
Just an average shopping street,Maybe I'm missing something but i don't understand the hype? This is simply another 'high street' in a different city/country. There is nothing unique. Its is extremely busy and to be frank offers nothing in the slightest bit unique... 
Great place to eat and buy cosmetics,"It's a bit overwhelming to see several of your favorite Korean beauty stores along the area. But I guess that feeling adds to the charm of Myeongdong. Great food and shops along the way. The place is bustling but clean. The prices are generally the same in the beauty stores. But the promotions differ. So, if you see something that you think is of good value, better snatch it! The next store, although the same, may carry a different promotion!"
Superb Shopping Experience,Best place for cosmetic lovers and there is absolutely no language barrier at this place. There is at least 1 English or Mandarin speaker in the shops. Most stores give freebies to customers . A Must go!
Cosmetic Heaven For Lady,"We stayed right beside popular Myeongdong Street. Beside cosmetic products you can get local street foods, korean restaurant, apparels & some local stuffs. International brand such as Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Forever 21 also available here.This busy street still active untill 2030hrs everday. Lot of hotels along the street. However the stuffs bit pricy compare to others downtown at Seoul.No issue on safety here, you can stroll the street safely, cctv almost everywhere."
Great atmosphere!,"Great shopping atmosphere and home to Seoul' s first department store Shinsegae...beautiful store with an amazing higher end food court, market and good hall. The street good vendors lend to the atmosphere...great for people watching "
Full of people with bags,"Restaurants, cafes, street food, shoes, clothing, cosmetics and....people buying, eating, grouping... The place is lively always when I’ll be walking there."
Expensive but pic worthy,Things r expensive here but since the K Pop became famousPpl flew to this place from allover just to CHECK IN into the cafes and some shops following the trendNothing muchJust cafes and shops and expensive clothes from china
Cosmetics Haven,"If you are into Korean cosmetics, this is the place to shop. They have great deals for all your cosmetic needs. But if you're not into cosmetics, this is still a great place to visit especially at night because there are a lot of restaurants from korean bbq to street foods and ice cream."
A must,"I went there after 6 pm and there were plenty of interesting street stalls selling hats, food, clothing, mibile phone cases, socks and snacks. The side streets nearby are also good to venture. All skin care shops are in the vicinity."
Great shopping mostly cosmetics ,"Well very busy shopping high street . Lovely to see vital and a lot of street food you must see , I rated only in resturant called pane pizza great Italian food while shopping "
The food is better than the shopping,"There are many tasty things to eat here, but I think the shopping is getting overpriced. You can find better deals inside of subway stations."
Myeongdong Review,"Large shopping street with many different shops and goods, especially for clothes and cosmetics. Also there are quite many places to have something to eat. For people who have the taste of shopping in traditional way rather than shopping centers."
Same things over and over again,"Same food, gadgets and accessories, even shops are the same nearly every block. The food on the street aren't that cheap for what they are."
Good but beware of false advertisement,"Good shopping area with lots for everyone. Just beware of false advertisement. The saem shop tried selling my fiancée ""buy one get one free"" on an item at 100k won saying they were 100k each - but when it came up on the till it was just 50k won each. We walked out after them trying to back out of the story. Beware of anything in shops without price tags. "
Shopping and street food,"Plenty to eat and shop. Loaded of Korean cosmetic brand, shoes and cloth. Pricewise is very attractive but, if you have time I would recommend try and look around several shops before you buy as prices may vary even for the same products. "
Busy Place for Shopping,"This place is busy even late at night. Plenty of food carts, skin care products, clothes, shoes. You can even watch some shows here like Nanta."
Great shopping and food street foods,This is a must visit. Lots of shopping and incredible amounts of new foods to try. My wife and I really enjoyed this area. it felt very safe as well.
Something for everyone.,I enjoyed the cultural experience and work of talented artesian. Stocked up on beautiful paper and calligraphy supplies.
Shopping places for Korean cosmetics and food,Pretty crowded and full of Korean cosmetics shops and restaurants. I think some of the restaurants are overpriced since it's a tourist spot?
방문,"It is the most famous shopping street in Korea. It is also the best place to meet young people. Since it is pushed by Japanese Chinese tourists, it is no longer a korea street.한국에 가장 유명한 쇼핑거리이다 젊은이들에 만남에 최고에장소이기도하다 언제부터인가 일본 중국관광객들에 밀려서 이제는 중국인거리라고해도 손색이없다"
A lot of shopping,"There are a lot of repetitive stores like same brands down the street. Should purchase in korea as home grown brands (innisfree, the saem, etude, nature republic, thefaceshop/thebodyshop) are much cheaper here locally. Masks when bought in bulk can go as low as US$0.50 per piece so do research and have a shopping list before your visit."
shopping..........shopping............,all famous brands of cosmetics are all around. also street food at night. I bought like a luggage of cosmetics. Too cheap to be real but it's real. ^^!
Great atmosphere! My fav spot,"This place just has a great atmosphere. There are so many restaurants, local stores, clothing stores, etc. This place is just great for shopping and have a good vibe. You would feel like walking in times square without the tall buildings though. You want to make sure you have gelato ice cream."
Love the shopping and stree food vendors,Lots of shopping and lively action going on all day into the evening. We had fun trying different foods at the street vendors. We will definitely come back.
Great Shopping Center,Great shopping center with some entertaining street snack...Many skin care product with low price and good quality..
Awesome,"Street food was amazing. In this market, you can find anything in this world from the lowest price to upper-average. Even adult toys is sold here. "
Shopping to the max!,Myeongdong street shopping is the greatest. The stores staff are accomodating and very helpful. They are also corteous.
Shopping,This is the place to go if your looking for cosmetics and clothings at discounted prices.The prices offered here are significantly cheaper than elsewhere.Look out for their 1+1 offers.
Great shopping especially for make up products,"It's very crowded with tourists everyday. There are alot of make up shops everywhere. Walk a few lanes and you will see alot of repeated shops selling masks, make up etc. The line shop is pretty packed too. The food stalls are pretty expensive. I rather go in a restaurant instead. But Myeongdong is great as you can find everything there."
Great shopping but...,"The shopping is really great, but since it's a tourist area it tends to be very crowded. Try to avoid going there on the weekends, also note that the restaurants are usually a bit more expensive there, but nothing major. "
Great Place,"Street where you can find everything. Shopping, good food, and church. Must visit place when in Seoul."
Shopping while street food culinary,"This is the place where you want to shop for cosmetics or even clothes. Once you are here to have to hold yourself, or you are going to buy everything. They even have a street food stall from the corner until the other side of myeongdong. There are cheap sweater or coat between them. Try the famous Kyoja noodle while you are there. You would need your passport if you buy cosmetic more than 30000 won to get tax refund."
Great food everywhere..! ,A bit crowded but the food and shopping is well worth it... lots of streets to visit most all have street food at a good price.
Lobster from a cart?,"Higher end food venders than Namdaemoon area. Lobster, crepes, etc. Wanted to try them all.Shopping was not very impressive but that was probably a personal thing. i saw more for me at Namdaemoon mkt."
Tons of Average,"Lots and lots of stores. Lots and lots of the same stores. How many Innisfree shops can there be? People flock here for the average purchase. When I was there, food carts were set up down the main street. It was busy with all sorts of activity. I tried several of the foods, but they were all ""fast food"" and not good food.Interesting to see."
Probably Korea's best known shopping district,"We visited the area during our walkabout of the Myeong-dong area. Lots of department stores and shops that sell brand name clothes, cosmetics and accessories. If you like branded products, you will probably like this area. However, I prefer local markets like Namdaemun where prices are cheaper and I don't have a preference for brand names."
Great,Stayed in a hotel in the area. Well worth it. So many things to see and buy. Sellers are friendly. A good place for shoe lovers. 
Shopping haven ,"We stayed here in myeongdong because I've read reviews about this place and we did'nt regret it.5mins walking distance from our hostel to the shopping district.The price of their shoes is much lower and you can take the tax refund also at the airport.Every corner has lots of beauty products to choose from.I enjoyed buying lots of face mask and make up from etude,skinfood,missha.The street foods was really tempting so you don't need to eat sometimes in the restaurant.We really enjoyed our shopping here.I just wish we had a chance to shop at the lotte mart."
Must see,"Myeongdong is one of the most important shopping area in Seoul and it famous for plastic surgery and women care products. Myeongdong Shopping Street is close to my Hotel and it Always busy.There are many shops, restaurants ,cafe in the street.On theother hand the smell not good.The product not cheap,you should bargain.I enjoyed buyfrech fruit in this market/"
Shopping spree,"Lots and lots of stores. We came here around 11 am on a Thursday morning. Place is full of people, and lots of stores having items on sale. I was able to load up on my face masks! Buy 30 masks for 60,000 won and you get another 30 masks for FREE at Tony Moly. They give you tons of free stuff too. I was able to buy some colored lenses for 45,000 won (buy 1 get 1 Free). Don’t forget to bring your passport to avail of the tax free on purchases 30,000 won and above. I heard the night market is pretty awesome too. But we left around 3pm. Totally a fun place to shop! "
Don't miss it,"This market is an exciting and authentic slice of the local experience, and should not be missed if you want to get a feeling for Seoul. There are some affordable items and notable things that are good values and also interesting are the various street foods and the experience of buying eyeglasses. Optical lens in Korea are very good and can be affordable and rapidly produced, but explaining what you want and working it all out is a bit of an adventure, in a good sense."
A shopping paradise for young ladies,"There are many shops, restaurants and street food stalls. Not cheap price and the quality not good. Selling fast fashion around the area. "
Lot of food and shop,"If you want to shop without getting bored in Seoul, this is the perfect place. Tons of hotels for food. We really loved the street food. Too much crowd in the evenings."
"If not the shopping, the street food is worth it.","This area is filled with stores. There are other things going on like a Nanta theater. The main focus is all the shopping so if Korean products (makeup, clothing, jewelry, or hats with Korean words) is what you're looking for then this is the place to go. It is very crowded, but not impossible. The largest UNIQLO in Korea is also located here. If it's not shopping then go for the all the different street foods (salty type and dessert types plus fruits. yes you can just get a cup of fresh blended fruit juice). Otherwise, there are also cafes to take a break if needed from the shopping."
Super lively with more cosmetic stores than ever,"Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics! Very lively with a lot of street food vendors as well. Area is safe, easy to navigate. A lot of clothes store as well. "
Happening place to shop and eat,"Went there in the evening in search of a seafood restaurant. This market is full of lanes loaded with stalls of variety of food and shops. Walked and shopped here for two to three hours. There are many local shops as well as malls in this area. All shopping stores start closing at 9:30 pm and after that only restaurants are open. If u r a fan of bao bao bags and can't afford it , here you can buy the cheap imitations at a very reasonable price. A good place to bargain. Loved shopping here. A must visit ."
List your shopping Needs!!,"Lots of stores to choose from. Better if you focus on what to buy. Great steals are of course buying in bulk. Buuuut, might end up buying more than what you need :p Street food - expensive compared with other locations such as those near universities. Shopping - found myself buying in duty free malls for instant tax refund."
Girls Paradise,"Big area full of girls paradise, skin care, makeup, dress, all you can find, plussss food was great here, u will get confuse what do u want too eat, coz everything was tempting!"
Cosmetic paradise,"Very crowded; a lot of foodstalls, a lot of souvenir-stalls, and cosmetic shops! You can also find many restaurants. In my opinion, this place the right place to shop cosmetics, they offer many discounts, and also the price is cheaper than in my country (indonesia). I don't recommend you to shop souvenir in this place, because you can find cheaper souvenir in other place.Happy shopping!! :)Note: there's also a beautiful cathedral (chatollic church)."
Shop and eat,"A lot of street food, wide variety. Some can be pricey. But there's also Macdonalds. Many shops, mostly beauty products. "
A heaven for shopaholic!!!,"I love this place so much!!!! Everything I want is here!!! Cheap cosmetics, delicious foods and korean costumes are all around!!!! I spent all of my trip here. Thanks Myeongdong "
A place to get beauty product and korean street food at night,"A place to walk around if your are looking for beauty products. Most of all the famous korean brand of beauty products can be found here. They even have LUSH shop here! At night the street in front of the shop turns into hawkers stall selling food item. You can get to taste all sorts of korean street food there. They have grill lobster, fried baby crab, rice cake, egg bun, ice cream and even halal kebab. If you are lucky you can also get good bargain for shoe at some of the shop. For tourist you can get the immediate tax refund from the shop with certain amount of purchase made but remember to bring along your passport."
A place to see a bit of everything in Korea,"You need to have 1-2 hours to stroll down this street to see small ornaments, suveniors etc... etc.. A place where you can buy lot of things to your freinds when you go home."
Myeongdong,"I love myeongdong. It likes a cosmetic street. Halal food also available near apple shop. Face shop, nature republic every day sales. Awesome"
A place to visit whenever in Seoul,Shopping all around is how I'll sum up this place. From the many stores selling anything from shoes to clothes to facial products it's a place that one must visit when in Seoul. There's also lots of food to choose from either from the restaurants or the food cart stores. 
Cosmetics heaven,"You will be surrounded by cosmetics shops..esp face mask. its heaven for women...a few good store like nature republic, innisfree, laneige, olive & young etc..look out for their promotion for best price. They try to lure you with free mask to go inside the shop. In the night, there will be alot people selling food and taste nice as well."
Don't know about the shopping but great food!,"I'm not really a shopping person but I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of street food here. Sometimes it's a bit of a puzzle to find out what is being prepared/sold, but that's part of the fun I guess."
cosmetic heaven,"you can get cheaper price if you bargain with the seller if you talk nicely and not complaining to them. for real. and the cosmetic is everywhere. most of the shop is selling the cosmetic from hair to your toes, i suggest you to go to nature republic. you got to spend a lot of time and money there."
Great place for food and shopping!,"Highly recommended if you enjoy street food and shopping for facial products!The streets will come to life with vendors selling yummy street food at about 5pm everyday. There's a whole wide range of foods that will be sure to satisfy your taste buds. Even if you go during winter, there's foods that will warm you right up!There's also many restaurants around that you can stop for a nice warm meal in the midst of your shopping :)Myeongdong is famous also for the facial products there! There's lots of sales persons outside the shops giving you free samples of their products in hope of attracting you into their stores. If you're looking for brands like Innisfree, Etude House, and other local brands, there's lots of them around! "
"Noisy, fancy","Myeongdong is the area of fancy fashion shops, restaurants and massage services (very useful after the long flight!). Maybe the best place in the city if you are looking for a serious branded items. Fot the cheaper choice visit the neighbouring Nangdaemun Market."
Cosmetic shopping haven,"Face mask, trendy clothes and food stalls. Cheap cosmetic and face care.Stating in philstay myeongdong metro is a good recommendation as the owner gives personalized service."
Shopping ,A lot of stores and yes street food. Many people and tourists of course on a Friday . We arrived at 9 pm and we noticed before 11 pm stores are starting to close even the street vendor. I'm not amazed food are expensive and I didn't find it quite good sorry. You could really compare it to Taipei night market. But my opinion is just for me you might enjoy here because of a lot of shops and duty free.
Young,Good younger people hanging out area to find good and cheap fashion and beauty products. Also have easy and well-priced eats. 
September 2017,"A "" must do"" in Seoul simply to experience all the different food stalls from pancakes to dumplings to octopus ... favourite was the meat filled korean dumplings ... awesome And as opposed to the sights often seen in asian cities like Thailand , nothing seedy or concerning ... would recommend to do if you are Seould"
Can't get enough of the place!,"We visited Seoul during the Holy Week and stayed at T Mark Hotel Myeongdong, just a few minutes leisurely walk or one subway stop away from the busier part of Myeongdong, its shopping street. We LOVE Myeongdong shopping street! We must have gone there almost every single night for shopping, Dinner, or simply strolling the busy lanes. We Love the place particularly at night when everything is lighted up. You won't run out of options for shopping and food, and the choices all fit anyone's budget. The atmosphere is lively, and just when you feel Myeongdong can't get any livelier and busier, the weekend comes and the already busy lanes are suddenly filled with more stalls carrying food, clothes, bags, etc. This place is a must visit to any tourist in Seoul. Don't forget to get your supply of Korean skin products! "
The biggest shopping street in Seoul,"Are you love shopping? if you love shopping, yes this place is suitable for you. Because there's a lot of branded item in here like : Uniqlo,Zara,H&M,Guess,Adidas and many mores. Or do you love cosmetics? Don't worry because Myeongdong shopping street is comprehensive like : Nature republic,Tony Moly,Etude House,Innisfree and many mores. if you go here, don't forget to bring your passport to get a special discount (if there's an event). And also taste street food in here."
Nice for a one-time visit,"Myeongdong is a must-visit of korea because of its popularity but it's only worth it to pop by for just one evening. It mainly consists of korean cosmetic shops and the same shop appears every 50m or so. Great if you need some makeup and skin care or if you want to visit flagship stores like style nanda pink hotel and Aland. Otherwise, if you are looking to just busk in a chill atnosphere, Hongdae more diverse and more happening."
Shop and street foods!,"A place for u to indulge in street foods and clothings. Facial products heaven but u should go to the mall basement area, there is a small facial products shop selling cheaper then the boutiques itself. Some snacks are over priced though.. but if u are looking for more trendy k-pop feel then u should head down to hongdae on a weekend. Street shows, buskers and now trending fashions heaven."
Shopping not cheap,In Seoul I didn't go to the electronic market. All the other markets and shopping areas I visited did not have any thing that's worth while carrying back as everything except for the facemasks and other beauty products can be bought in most other countries I have visited at a cheaper price.Seoul is definitely not a shopping destination.
Shopping Paradise,"Here at Myeongdong you will also find big-name stores like Spanish fashion chain, ZARA and Forever 21. Migliore, easily accessible via Exit 4, Myeong-dong Subway Station, is a starting point to shop for many tourists coming out of the subway station.There are also many street food stalls serving traditional Korea delicacies such as fish cakes, tteokbokki (a stir-fried dish made of rice cakes with vegetables in hot sauce) as well as new food inventions like the potato tornado! So if you don’t have time for a proper sit-down dinner/lunch, just grab some food on the go, shop through a few shops/street stalls and then grab something else from the next food stall and continue on!"
interesting area to visit for local food and souvenirs,it took us 1 hour to wander thru this street as there are many nice shops. great place for tourists to buy souvenirs and to taste local food. 
Korean Shopping Market on Steroid,"This is definitely a tourist trip, but also a local trip. When you think of visiting Korea, you think of cosmetics, fashions, shoppings, etc. This shopping block is all of them on repeats. After 5-10 steps, you see another facial shop selling masks, cosmetics shops, clothing shops. There are also some good restaurants and street food options. At night, there are food vendors also selling street foods. An interesting fact about Korea is that they strongly encourage visitors to take people and upload them online. There is a big Line Friend shop that people would line up and take pictures. Overall, it is an interesting experience. "
Great shopping!,Loved walking around here and buying awesome cosmetics! So much to see and alleys to walk through! You can get lost b cause you have so much fun walking around! 
Shopping frenzy in the heaven of comestic,This is heaven of comestic. A lot of brand: Innisfree (wifi-free); Natural Repubpic; Style Nanda (only one store)Street food is expensive and It does not match my taste
All about skin care,"most of the shops are for skincare and cosmetic product like Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Laneige, Faceshop, TonyMoly , etc. Hungry..? The street is fully of food carts in the evening. also have few halal food carts."
one of the best places to stay or visit,"Myungdong is one of the best places for shopping, food with short distance benefit to connect to sightseeing places. It is in the middle of the Seoul (Northern part of river) which can be easily connected to Namsan (top hill), Gyeongbok palace and other palaces, Cheongye streams and many museums. I recommend to stay near Myundgong and visit these fantastic sightseeing places and enjou night at Myundong. You will enjoy a lot of fasion products and a full bunch of street food and restaurants~~"
Great Place to Shop,"This is one of our must-visit places in Seoul. It was as what we expected - lots of shops, restaurants, street foods, ... and people. Since our hotel was 15-minute away, we went here everyday - morning, afternoon, and every evening.Many of our must-eat restaurants are also in Myeongdong. We had pan-fried chicken, dumplings, noodles, BBQ, ice cream. There are also many great coffee shops here. If you know how to shop, you can also find bargains for stylish and trendy clothes.And ... there are lots of people here."
Nice Shopping,Different than other shopping spots in Asia - for locals but tourists are seen as well. Have a great time ion this great city
"Was ok, a bit loud, but not as good as expected","Must visit for sure, but I did not think it was great snd the shopping os only average. Lots of beauty shops which is the norm everywhere in Korea."
Fun hustling area,"It was fun to aimlessly wander in this area, with plenty of things to lay your eyes upon, to buy or to eat. It's colorful day and night, and it was an enjoyable to discover some Seoul in a short citybreak."
Shopping Mecca for Cosmetics,Cosmetics stores abound in this area where cheap but quality products are on sale.... a million won is just about 5thousand pesos so dont be discourage when buying..
Not to bad,Myeongdong is a famous shopping street.. I think it's good.. But its expensive.. Sorry but the Korean people dose not respect me and dose not respect the Korean law about smoking.. 
Street food,"We stayed at the Myeongdong area so we came everyday to enjoy the street food and shopping. Love their food specially tteokbokki, geranpang, and scallop cheese. So many things to see and to buy. And they can keep the area clean."
Bustling Street from Dawn to Dusk!,"Visiting Korea will not be complete without passing Myeongdong! Cosmetic and food lovers, young and young once, ladies and gents will find this part of Seoul quite dazzling! The fusion of Myeongdong Cathedral, hotels, shops, theater, foods makes this place a must stop in visiting Korea. The lady attendants are speaking good english already so foreigners can easily communicate. Enjoy your shopping!!"
Good shopping. ,Good shopping. Thank goodness I was here with my teenage daughter and not my husband! Loads of different types of shops. Store staff friendly and not pushy. Felt very safe working around. Loads of coffee shops that you can hop into when your arms get too tired!
Great food,"This has absolutely everything you could imagine for shopping, and incredible food stalls all along the way. Why had I never had a cheese scallop before?Incredible. "
Beauty overloan,"Great place to find all the Korean beauty products, shop! Don't miss Lotte department store food court and market. Just the best. "
Myeongdong street food,"When speaks about Myeongdong most people think about shopping for clothes, accessories, cosmetics, etc. But for me Myeongdong is a good place to eat, especially on the street. There are lots of delicious street foods you can choose and enjoy."
Shopping for cosmetics,"Basically camped out at Missha, Laneige and Innisfree. The place is full, literally full, of shops selling cosmetics. Every street has the same few names repeated. Also lots of shops selling trendy clothes. Then walked under ground to Lotte mart and got Lotte biscuits. And there is live abalone 6 for 30000 won. "
Street food at night ,"No trip to Seoul would be complete without trying the delicious street food. We saw vendors along the streets of Myeong-dong selling a variety of foods, ranging from pineapple and melon to corns, fried squid to Nutella crepes. The prices are good (around 2000-5000 won). I enjoyed the fried cheese, the hotdogs, the bun with an egg..."
Makeup Haven,Korean makeup stores everywhere I truly enjoyed shopping for my favorite makeup brands especially its much cheaper than in my home country. What makes it even more enjoyable I got to take a lot of freebies thou sometimes you have to ask from the sales lady. Some are not friendly and not accomodating not all can speak in English. There are Taiwanese and Chinese sales lady who can speak in Mandarin. Night market and street food vendors starts at 4pm onwards which I truly indulge in them. ALWAYS BRING YOUR PASSPORT if you spent Krw30000 to get tax refund and ask the store first if they would refund it outright otherwise you will need to get the tax refund at the airport
The heart of Seoul,We stayed for 5 nights in the heart of Myeongdong. It was a great choice. We are not really shoppers but there are shops everywhere including some very large department stores. Prices are comparable to those in Australia if not higher however I am sure the dedicated shopper would find better prices in some of the smaller outletsThe great attraction of this place is the market food stalls which set up everywhere after around 2pm offering all kinds of Korean delicacies freshly prepared in front of you and costing very littleThere are some good restaurants in the area as well which we managed to visit however we couldn't resist the food stalls each day even for just a quick snackGlad we stayed here and would do so again next time we visit Seoul
Myeong-dong shopping,"Myeong-dong shopping area is very conveninance near subway line 2 and line 4. Each shopping ticket amounted over 30,000 won can get tax free directly or tax refund at designated counters or kiosks at Myeong-dong Shopping Area. Get the tickets and ask the shop staff you can have clear and comprehensive information. Enjoy 10% tax refund."
Myeongdong!,Must visit when in Korea. So many stores and restaurants in the vicinity. If you have lots of budget i would suggest to stay in hotels in this area.
Paradise of cosmetics lover,"My wife spent one whole day to purchase cosmetics, and many store clerks are very generous to offer u a lot lot of samples!"
Busy and good prices!,"A huge number of shops and modern styles. You can find all you are looking for, even on the side streets."
Shopping Shopping Shopping,Bustling shopping neighborhood. Dozens of cosmetics shops - you can walk 5 minutes and find 4 different Nature Republic shops. At night they have food carts with lots of delectable eats. Great for daytime or evening exploring!
Nice neighbourhood ,"The area around the cathedral is very trendy but still very Asian. The market has this particular ambiance with all kind of local street food and tourist stuff. Lots of stores in the area too including a huge Lotte. It's central area for a stay in Seoul. Close to the metro station, the city hall, and touristic attractions."
Meant for the ladies,"Myeongdong street is huge and mainly dominated by cosmetics shops so if you have that shopping list from friends & family to fill, this would be the perfect place.You will find cosmetics shops every step of the way and the face masks are at ridiculously cheap prices in packs. You can find Zara, Adidas, Nike and a few other famous shops too. There's also street stalls selling Supreme goods (fufu or fake, obviously) and food which can be quite expensive, in my opinion. If you are looking for endless options of clothes, head over to Dongdaemun instead."
Too crazy but good experiences ,A great place to get your cosmetic but the street were too hectic and confusing. Most of the sale speaks Chinese so it was ok if you try to specific product. Most Korean can speak English and understandable but not great.
Nice to get the filling of local life,The street is very busy with many shops and restaurants. It is full most of the day and offers a nice insight into the local city life.
Night time wander ,"It's a lovely place to wander around at night, hustle and bustle of the locals and tourists makes it a lively place - full of local eats, street food and deserts!Not really a place to go and drink - but there are one or two bars in the area (unless I just completely missed them!) "
Great for skincare shopping,Loads of Koreans brands of skincare and make up in these few streets. Also lots of restaurants from bbq to noodles to street food snacks.Plenty of souvenirs and clothes to shop so there is something for everyone!
Loved shopping here,"Mostly malls close around 8pm in Seoul which is early for me as In singapore they close around 9:30pm - 10pm. This market was only place which be busting with people after 8pm also. So many shoe shops and lot of korean cosmetic shops, you could buy everything from there. great street food."
"Busy, busy","It is very busy I thing 24 hours, if you like shopping and eating you are in the right place, try street food!"
"Cosmetics, shoes, clothes, food, sneaky cat cafe","It is everything you read, it's probably more than that. For westerners that come for makeup, I'm not sure you'll like it. It's brands you don't really get (at least in Australia) on top of the possible language barrier in either shop assistant or product text. It starts waking up around 10am, it's a big area, but some brands have 2-3 shops of varying sizes in the area. At night there are night food stalls which are delicious. Or many a Korean bbq meals. "
Main shopping area in Seoul,"If you like shopping or have time to kill, this is the place for you. Hundreds of shops and restaurants are within this shopping area. If you prefer street food, you would not be disappointed to try the taste of local street food. As it is located in the city centre, it is easy to go there by taking metro; do not drive there as you would have difficulty to park your car."
"It's cool but crowded as heck, so come with a purpose if you can!","I came here just because I know this area is famous, but really and truly you should only come here if you need makeup, skin care products, or the like. There are SO many stores selling all kinds of products for skin; I think I saw over 200 different brands of face masks that day. It was also hot and very crowded, so prepare for that as I'm under the impression that it's generally like that. There were people on the streets giving out samples too in an attempt to get you to come into their stores. They'll particularly target you if you're a foreigner, so be prepared to say ""no thank you"" in Korean if you want to politely and not ""noobishly"" turn them down. Overall, it's a cool place. If you're in Seoul I definitely recommend going just to check it out, especially if you want to buy makeup or face masks or something like that. There are some restaurants there too, as well as coffee shops so you can also stop for food or a snack if you need to. Not to mention, Myeongdong is pretty central to the city - my friend and I walked to Namdaemun market from there, as well as Namsan tower in the evening, and it was a really nice walking day (so wear close toed shoes). The subway is also close, and the area where you get off the subway right next to the big Myeongdong market area is also nice and has a Lotte Mart, a Daiso, and a bunch of other stores there too. It's a very nice place to visit :)"
Beauty Product Heaven,"Went on a Sunday afternoon and the streets were packed. Just about every beauty product you can think of is available. Reasonable prices. Sunday also features a great assortment of street food including lots of fish and lobster. Price per serving is around 5,000 to 10,000 KRW. Definitely worth a visit for the experience. "
Go on a Sunday for street food and good shopping! ,"Sundays after 1:00 P.M. are a great time to come here to shop and try famous Korean street food. From lobster tail to chicken skewers to waffles, everyone is sure to find something to satisfy. Also, the shops range from H&M to Zara to Nike you will find something that you are looking for. Also find, a large Methodist and Catholic Church. Plan to spend a few hours there. "
Great Place To Hang Around For Many Days - 可以膩在這裡很多天的好地方,"We are here for three days already. We hang around the area & kind of too spoiled by this area because it is full of varieties - street vendors and all kinds of shops, famous popular shops and too many little shops await you to find out, & restaurants that you should try one by one. We buy too many things and can not stop buying. You will know the place only when you are here.我們待在這裡已經三天了，一直待在這個讓我們寵壞的區域因為這裡什麼都有～太多路邊攤和各式各樣的店、網路名店和自己找出來的一大堆個性店、還有應該一間一間吃的各種餐廳，我們買了好多東西，很可怕的是停不下來。。。請來親自體驗！"
Amazing shopping hub,Reasonable price and fair quality. Food also nice and cheap. Can have half day exploring and enjoying here.10k won for each nice hat! Good deal I think!
A place cannot be missed,"A famous shopping paradise in Seoul, you cannot miss it, otherwise you may regret. Apart from shopping, there were many street snacks like traditional Korean snacks, grilled abalone, cut fresh fruit and many more... You can't stop eating during the street exploring."
Myeong song Shopping Street,"My son and I loved strolling through the streets of the marketplace. There is lot of foot traffic and some motorcyclist, so be very keen of your surroundings."
must visit when you are in seoul!,"exit via Myeong-dong Subway Station, it is really aceessible. street local delicacies. so many starbucks around. heaven for the ladies! must visit when you are in seoul!"
For shopping ,"People go there for shopping but I prefer a big mall. This street is too busy all the time. Full of tourists. If you are curious, visit just once."
Great shopping and tasty street food!!!,"I absolutely loved Myeongdong! It offers my two favorite things: cheap eats and shopping. There is no shortage of places to purchase clothing or beauty products! All of the beauty supply stores offer amazing discounts and BOGO deals on sheet masks and other beauty products. In between shops we tried all types of delicious street food. Definitely try the fried spiral potatoes, the spicy rice cakes and the lobster tails with mozzarella."
Halal food avail,"There is halal snacks available, one near the zara and forever21. And another along the street. We prayed at the cultural centre which is located at the upper floor,.it's either 3rd or 5th floor at the entrance between Zara.And.forevrr21. Halal food at busanjip which is at one of the alleys. Ask the people in red and a red hat, information people for directions.Myeongdong street is facial products heaven. Not for clothes, clothes at dongdaemum or ehwa uni. Please compare the price against the shops down the road, there are always discounts and offers available.You should watch Nanta if you're there. Funniest live show ever. Really made me LOL"
ready for the promo's of thier beauty products!!!!,"it slocated where you can buy thier beauty products a lots a place to chooice with,the street is amazing food try to go with empty stomach so can try all the food on the street."
Busy shopping place,"If you love to shop and do not mind of the crowd then this is a place to visit. A heavy crowded and busy place. Most of the streets are narrow and watch out for the cars passing by. A lot of beauty products, retail stores, street food carts and restaurants. Foods are expensive though in this area."
Kind of a classic busy Asian shopping area,"I prefer going to Gangnam for shopping, but if you're looking for that good ol shoulder to shoulder experience, check this place out. Might be a little crazy but it's still fun! "
Great shopping and food,"Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, clothes, trinkets, food. Easy to get to by subway. Stores don't open til 10am and there is street food at night."
Very Hap place and a shopper's paradise,"Its the main down town market of Seoul and you get everything you want under the sun on the street. From food, to caps, to clothers, etc.etc.The ""Dollar Store"" across the street is located in a 7 storeyed building and is a just right store for all tourists. Keep 2 hours minimum in hand to look and buy all things."
The busiest street in South Korea,"Just be aware that there are a lot of people always on this street. The number of good restaurants is around. Samgyetang, Gomtang and Jeonju bibimbap etc... It could be a bit annoying to see people calling you for massages and some other stuff. Also have a lot of shops for cosmetics... It is really shopping heaven. "
nice,"you can never get sick shopping here, especially knowing that your own country charges you double or more for the same products "
Busy and expensive ,"The shopping area is full of shops selling face cream and masks, clothes shops and small restaurants. It is busy and expensive. You get better food and cheaper goods outside this area."
Overcrowded shopping street,"This street is always overcrowded, but particularly at night, when the street food stalls appear. It is quite atmospheric, but it gets annoying if you don't like crowded places.There's a huge Uniqlo store if you need to do some clothes shopping. If you're looking for cosmetics, there are soooo many shops you can choose from."
Shopping area with everything,"You can do all your shopping in one places. In this area, it's the super big hub for Korean drug store cosmetic brands. Many shops selling same or similar things. There are 2 big anchor department store here that you can find more upscale and quality products. "
A must ,"We went twice there, A lot of shopping in this place, there is Daiso there, we didn't see it at first ;so cheap with great stuff don't miss it"
Super busy but fun,Its mental here. So many people and so much to see. Great shopping for girls especially for skin care products but I just liked the food great street food and plenty of options. If you are in the area or headed to the seoul tower its worth checking out even if just for a feed
A place to see,"Myeongdong is more than a street is a place where you can see how Seoulians are living, shopping and entertaining. You can taste some street food, enjoy restaurants offering different cuisines, make some shopping. But at the end, you will definitely feel happy. Don't miss visiting this shopping area."
Kpop lovers,I love the beauty products and kpop stuff. You can also enjoy yummy food here. Enjoy nanta show if you have time.
Some interesting shopping,"Just off the street there are a few nice outdoor mall areas that boast an array of souvenir shops, chemists and restaurants. We could only find one bar and it was not open until late. "
Overwhelming and awesomely good,"Street food, restaurants, skincare shops, clothing shops are abundance. You can literally everything and anything (stuffs that you need and even stuffs that you didn't know you need). It can get really crowded especially on the main alley that some people might find it overwhelming. Use the smaller alleys to avoid the crowding.Make sure to visit on an empty stomach. Bear in mind, depending on the number of food items you bought from the street food (not cheap), altogether the cost would probably be enough for you to get a meal for 2 at a sitting down restaurant. Example:Meal for 2 at a jjimdak restaurant 29,000won (with refillable side dishes and you get cold water)Street Food (below are just some of the street foods but there are a ton more varieties)fresh fruit drink 5,000wonchicken skewer 3,000wonfish cake skewer 2,000wongrilled small-med lobster tail 7,000wongrilled pen shell 7,000won"
Overwhelming but if you want a bargain this is the place.,I only breezed through here but it was super overwhelming. Definitely a bargain shoppers paradise. Lots of variety. 
Skin care overload,"Everyone comes for the skincare deals and street food stalls - and there's an abundance of it.All the big korean brands have several branches every few blocks, so if one particular shop is full of people, you can walk several meters to the next corner and you'll probably see another store of the same brand. There are also loads of deals at each store. Special freebie packs that change monthly, free face masks upon entry, tons of samples at the counter, and more.For food, you'll never go hungry. For 1000-6000 won per stall, you can try everything from grilled meats to seafood to footlong ice cream to freshly squeezed juices. There are also plenty of sit down restaurants around.It's a busy area that never seems to run out of tourists and locals."
Shopping and Food Heaven,"There's not much to say about this place because it is already famous and well-documented as one of the must-visit place in South Korea. There's a lot of thing to buy here especially cosmetics and beauty products. There also a lot of fashion store, electronics, restaurants and local food stall which is very intriguing to try. Overall, it is very enjoyable place to visit."
Street Food Heaven!,"I loved that our hotel was right next to Myeongdong! It is a busy, exciting shopping/eating/entertainment area. I was surprised that almost every other store was for cosmetics and skin care items. I guess that's really big in Korea. What tickled us was the delicious street food from the vendors with their carts who came out just about when the sun went down. Fresh fruit, juices, smoothies, grilled butter lobster, octopus, conch shells, chicken, barbecue meats, egg puff pastries, 15 inch ice cream cone swirls, roasted chestnuts and sweet potatoes,and even spiral cut potatoes (and hot dogs in a spiral potato!)...We tried everything and they were all delicious and fresh. The whole area is festive and all lit up. This is a must-do while in Seoul!"
Lots of food and fun,"This is a great place during the day, but really picks up after dark. The streets are lined with shops and street food vendors. We enjoyed all the cosmetics shops and dessert options."
"Looking for makeup, this is the place.","Visited this area, much more than one street, several city blocks with many streets and side streets. The area contains make up, clothes, food, drink. At night there are food vendors and night market type vendors. This is a very busy area at night. Good place to catch dinner and pick up some items you might need ."
Great for small gifts,The area is great if your looking for small gifts. Most of the shops sell the same thing but you can find a few small odd and end things. Nice to stroll in the evening. 
Shopping and Food Paradise,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a place you MUST go to when visiting Seoul. First of all, there is an extensive range of shopping there, both cheap and high end. There are so many different stores in Myeongdong that there will definitely be a place for everyone. Shops are open until late at night, and you can shop til you drop! Literally! As a foreigner, I was worried as I have very limited korean language skills, however all shop assistance and street stall owners were very kind and helped me in finding directions. The food there is amazing, and the food stalls sell korean snacks and foods that are absolutely delicious and you must try it. There are also many restaurants there to choose from, mainly serving Korean food, and at a reasonable price. Since I lived in a hotel in the shopping street, everything was very convenient. The hotels in the area are not very expensive and I would recommend staying near or in the shopping street as it is very convenient and there is also a subway station very near, and there are many taxis too. In regards to shopping, there are Korean boutiques selling cheap but good quality and stylish clothing, as well as bigger brands. There are also many Korean cosmetic stores and MANY FREE SAMPLES ARE GIVEN. There are also more high end brands located there. Basically, everything you could possibly want is in Myeondong! It is a food and shopping paradise and not very expensive at all. It is a MUST visit destination for tourists!"
AMAZING MUST GO!,"Since I lived in a hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, I was exposed to the shopping street day and night which was fantastic, it was both busy in the morning and at night and gave off a pleasant atmosphere. Here, there were a wide variety of stores and it really is quite exciting. Here, there are mainly cosmetic stores, clothing stores and such which is perfect for the shoppers: I bought so much there. Not to mention, at 5pm the street food stalls open and let me tell you they are delicious. Normally, when I travel i feel foreign or not so welcomed but when I went here it was so warm (even though it was winter and I WAS FREEZING) and welcoming. I can't emphasise enough but this is a must go destination for those wanting good shopping and excitement. Coming at day gives one feeling but coming at night provides you with the food stalls and exciting lights and such so choose wisely! It is definitely worth it!"
Shopaholic haven ,"If you're really into Korean skincare, cute accessories or trendy clothes this is definitely a place for you to visit! The only thing is it can get quite crowded here especially towards the evening, but visiting a bit earlier before sunset around 6pm ish is still ok. There are also loads of street foods to try out and restaurants ticked away to help re-energise you for more shopping! The sales assistants are all lovely and helpful and not too pushy."
Place for Korean cosmetics and others,"Always very crowded but you can find loads of Korean cosmetics shops around. Off course there are also clothes,shoes shops and restaurants.There is also a Nanta theater. The money exchange places are open daily and the rates in my case were quite good."
shopping in bulk,"If you are in the mood for voyeurism and shopping, than this is the place to be. Masses of people from all over, navigating the beauty/fashion world in a pleasant environment. You can find everything from fresh seafood meals to kpop to bubblebath....."
A shopping meca in Seoul,"Nice place for wandering around. Plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes. A lot of vendors. A lot of opportunities for shopping around and having a delicious food. Do not miss the flowering ice-creams."
Good place for cheap shopping.,Nice place to grab some bargains. Lots of choice for souvenirs and food options good. Surrounded by larger mall type shops
Street food starts only 5PM!,"Don't do like I did and go there before 5PM. Although all shops will be open, you won't find the most important: the food stalls, which arrive at 5PM. Most of the stores are for women. A lot of cosmetics, accessories and clothing. It's a nice place to go at night."
"Shop till you drop: Beauty stores, Night food market and underground clothing stores.","A great place to shop for: -Beauty products (skincare and makeup) -Has many chain brands: Apieu, Aritaum, The Face Shop, Skinfood etc. - Behind all the beauty brands, there are great places to eat! - Beware of sales people outside of the shops, they will approach you. -Free samples upon entering all beauty shops. -Many cheap clothing stores (8000 won and up). -Stationary stores. Stroll along the various streets at night if you want to see the food stalls selling street food! They start selling at around 6pm."
Awesome ,Great place to do shopping be careful like everything is so cute and you can find all kind of stuffs so it's better to leave this place for the last day in Seoul so you will not worry about your budget and buy whatever you want. 
Nice to stroll for food or anything else!,"We walked about and forgot the time because we tried streetfood and browsed the uncountable stores around this area.Is it a combination of bars, streetfood and Korean restaurants but for streets!!! It is hatd to make a choice so we always came back for lunch and/or dinner...Some places are open all night long.You also find few places serving western food."
"Very busy, very fun!!",Great place to get street food and cheap souvenirs. People watching was also enjoyable. Very crowded area with lots to see.
Great place to get everything,"This is a great street to get anything Korean and shop till you drop. You can bargain if you want, but they will mainly give you a discount only if you buy a bit more than one or two items. Lots of nice street food available, so basically you can shop and eat your way the whole day here."
Shopping Paradise,"Always like to buy things here. With all the cosmetics brands here. You sure can find what you need and want. If you come at night, along the street there is different stalls selling food and drinks. "
Shopholic Confession,I love shopping here but (bit expensive) whenever we in Seoul and our daughter love the cat mascot too. There also halal restaurants to choose but we love trying Korean food (seafood) 
Shopping and Eating,"Myengdong Shopping is a vibrant shopping and eating extravaganza. The place to go for cosmetics, lots of cosmetics. Crowd watching is also fun. Street food vendors offer an array of local food selection but in my opinion, they are overpriced."
"Shopping, food and sights!","Great for shopping, especially cosmetics! If you are not satisfied with the discounts from a particular shop, just walk on and you will find another similar store with even better discounts.Street food carts set up around 3 plus in the afternoon and the view of the carts coming down the streets is a sight to behold. Delicious street food like baked squid and strawberry mochi are must-trys!Best place to rest your feet after shopping is at Sulbing:) Their bingsus are amazing and worth every penny! Daebak! Tried the green tea, cheesecake and summer melon special. Green tea is the best! They also have free flow buckwheat tea to quench your thirst.You'll never get tired of Myeongdong!"
Very Active Street,"A lot of Malls, Shops and Street Food in this street. I don't mind spending hours in this street because you can find in it all what you need in shopping."
Better For Women Than Men - Unless You're Looking For Food,"Great area to explore and do some shopping and food sampling. Lots of cosmetics if you're into that. Slightly better at night as more food vendors are open for business. Great variety and inexpensive way to try authentic Korean street food. Not a lot of friendly faces, but easy to point at what you want to purchase. Recommended as 'one of the top 10 things to do in Seoul'."
"Shopping, shopping, shopping!","Very touristy area with lots of shopping, street food, and of course tourists! You can find all the cosmetic stores here, athough the prices are a lot cheaper at the duty free stores inside Incheon airport. The street food are all delicious and cheap. There are some good buys from the carts selling stuff in the middle of the street (like women's clothes and sunglasses), but I would stay away from the actual stores unless they have really good deals because they're just more expensive. The place is very crowded, but it's a good place to visit in Seoul!"
You can find all brand korean cosmetics here,Its really easy to find all korean cosmetics here. If you are line lovers there also a line store. If you want to buy korean ginseng I suggest you buy in the farmacy. 
Cool night,"Anything except Myeongdong smell of Korean life!I mean, if you live out the high skyscraper and the business company, here you can find the real life of Koran.Cool also for going out for dinner with friends"
Nice shopping street,"First time visit the shopping street, a lot of things to buy, eat and drink. There are many shops selling various kinds of skin products, cosmetics. Facial masks selling at cheap prices. It's pretty crowded when we were there but we still spend a few hours shopping there. Really a shopping haven."
Street food galore,"We visited Myeongdong Street early afternoon and walked around and looked at the many shops. About 4.30 in the afternoon, all the street vendors started appearing and the smell and sights were just amazing! Lots of different foods were sampled ranging from baked potatoes to luscious seafoods curries stirfries fruit and deep fried ice cream! Many people to see as well! Highly recommend a visit and go hungry as there's lots to choose from!"
People watching ,"Myeongdong streets are perfect for shopping and watching people. We spend five days in the city and found several streets closed for traffic but open for Vendors for their merchandise. Activity starts at mid-afternoon/early evening until past midnight. Korean made products are in abundance, especially beauty and other related items. Of course Food and more food are available, very entertaining just to walk around and see the variety of food and merchandise available."
Love the shopping streets ,We visited Myeongdong shopping streets few times. So many shops and restaurants. Thoroughly Enjoyed shopping these streets. There are also many street stalls. Very vibrant and busy.
Nothing much,Less than expected! I'm that type of people who cannot survive with the smell of fried food!The stuff there are mostly can be found anywhere and the prices are quite high 
Lots of things to buy and great good place,It's full of things to buy and eat! Especially during the night time! I bought some cosmetics as it were very cheap. 
Premier Shopping Destination ,"Myeongdong is one of the busiest places in Seoul and it is considered Korea's premier shopping destination. It is a stunning shopping district with countless shops and restaurants. With Lotte and Shinsegae anchoring the area and a number of large shopping malls lie along the streets. Clothing shops or cosmetics can be seen at a very corners and streets stall for the spaces in between offering tasty street food snacks and inexpensive clothes and accessories. Can be easily reach by taking the Subway: Subway Line 2 Euljiro 1-ga Station Exit 6 and Subway Line 2 Myeongdong Station Exit 6. Myeong-dong combination of historical significance, nearby tourist attractions, and prime shopping has established it as the ultimate tourist destination in Seoul."
interesting but mostly beauty and skin care,"My teenage kids loved the excitement and vibe of the area. Alot of neat little places to eat and when the street food comes out it gets interesting. As far as shopping, it's mostly beauty and skin care. A lot of western clothing stores but we really enjoyed the excitement and vibe of the area. "
Great food and shopping for teens and young adults,"Absolutely loved the food here at 4 places here:1. Andong Jimdak (braised chicken)2. Myeongdong Dumplings3. O Sulloc cafe4. Gogung restaurantThe shopping here is catered mainly for skin care , Line teddy bear and young adult/ teen fashion."
Skin care heaven,80% Of the shops are for skincare and cosmetic product. And loads of restaurants. Best part is the street foods.
Absolutely loved it,"Ladies, this place is heaven Seven shops out of ten is a cosmetic or skin care shop. The choice is enormous. There are lots of places to eat around, some stalls with street food and just fun place to be"
You find everything ,"Good for an afternoon time. All shops are there, sellers are quite familiar with English and the range of products covers any need.Plenty of choices to eat or have a coffee break.Prepare your credit card and go! Enjoy"
Packed,"Its no doubt that this is a good place for shopping. I don't really enjoy shopping, so i don't find this place suits me. There's delicious food stall around, I enjoyed the food. However not very friendly staff, I don't feel welcomed."
interesting...busy and fun,"this is a busy shopping area heaps of diversity throngs of people,definetly not boring,especially later in the day"
Lousy and expensive street,"when I was a child, Myong Dong Street was for every body. but recently, the shop focused on Only Chinese visitor. some snack and street food are too expensive to eat. Pls Don't eat Street food and Don't buy anying in MyongDong. just eye shopping only. you had better shopping local shop in another area."
Great Shopping,"While I was living 2 hours south of Seoul in the middle of nowhere, this became my go to shopping district. It has every store imaginable. Great street food while also a great variety of restaurants. We were also able to find decent accommodation in the area."
Great Location,Busses drop PJ hotels gestures you never get bored From Myeondong Market Korean peoples too kind and Helpful
Shopping Experience ,"Very busy neighborhood, but great for shopping. Cosmetic stores are all over the place, you can shop and then relax with a great Korean massage!"
Nice place for shopping and street food~,Very crowded but so worth to visit for cosmetic shopping as the shops in Myeongdong provides the most sample products and gift! Street food also very tasty!
Nice walk,Nothing very exciting but it s convenient place for shopping. On evening there is lot of small shops to eat on the street and there is lot of souvenirs shops.This place is great to find restaurant on evening or to change money.
Full of people and shops,"Great place to do some shopping in Seoul. Tons of cosmetic shops, clothing stores, department stores, street vendors, you name it. Almost forgot, this place is packed with hotels and restaurants. Got take a look."
Crowded and hot in the summer! ,"Good shopping and yummy food, bring cash and an empty stomach! The cheesy lobster is very good and the fresh fruit juices are a treat!"
Plenty of shops and restaurants,"You can get to Myeongdong shopping street taking the subway and alighting at Myeongdong station at the south or Euljiro 1-ga up north of the area.It is almost like a huge square and you walk from north to south and then east to west. There are many exits but EXITS 1,2,3 & 4 would lead to the opposite side of the street. So better to exit at EXITS 5,6,7,8 or 9. There's also a underground shopping mall at exit 7 and 8. Exit 8 would lead you to the iconic green leaf building of Nature Republic.It's better to come in the evening till late if you want to sample their street food. There's also NANTA theatre, (not to be confused wth Myeongdong Theatre). Of course you can find shops and shops of cosmetic and skin care products, restaurants, cafes, massage parlor, fashion outlets and hair salons. Look out for their CAT cafe and DOG cafes if you are a animal lover.There are guides in distinctive uniform walking around offering help to tourist. Most shop attendance and restaurant staff speak Mandarin, so language is not really a problem. It's a must visit if you are in Seoul. "
Tourist shopping spot,Skin care and all korean local brand are all here for you in one street. Late evening also have the street local food for you to enjoy!
The street is not as busy as 2 years ago - good for shoppers!,"2 years ago there were lots of Mainland Chinese tourist, too crowded and you can't really enjoy shopping! Also the staff are more cater for Chinese tourist - they can only speak Korean and Mandarin but not English! Still lots of cosmetic shops along the street but at least this time the staff are not that pushy, and more friendly!"
Must visit place in Seoul,"Not as inexpensive as in Goto Mall, more classy stores are found here. Mnay local Korean brands (clothes and cosmetics) here, and the food stalls are very attractive too! Energetic place, love it!"
Must try street food,A lot of street food that you should try and some of them should put up a 'halal' sign if it's halal so that we don't have to always ask the same questions.The socks sold there are must buy too as I tried to buy bulk in dondaemun but don't find that kind of design.Souvenir t shirt can buy at Namdaemun for lower price.
Shop. Eat. Repeat.,"We were here on a Monday night and the main pedestrian streets were really busy. I'm glad we didn't come on a weekend! Great place to shop, people watch and eat. Plenty of street food available."
Crowded shopping street,"Staying 3 nights in this area gave me a lot of time to explore this street. A lot of Korean brand cosmetic store offer a lot of promotions, and they are giving some sample for the visitors. I also recommend to try their restaurants, spread all over the place."
Be prepared to get hustled,"Myeongdong is famous for cosmetics and skin care shopping. It certainly spans across a large area, although I did find that most stores were repetitive and so, competition among business units can be quite strong. This area sure is a visual treat at night when street food vendors and store promoters are up and about their business. You will get lost at some point. I would be careful of the promoters who can get quite aggressive when distributing their free samples (I got hustled by one and was absolutely shaken by the experience)."
Street Eats Galore while you shop,Had a great time just window shopping at the retail stores and gazing at all the street food options along this famous shopping street. Something for everyone
"If You Like To Shop, You Should Go!","I've started taking an interest in Korean skincare and makeup in the last couple of years, and Myeongdong always came up as a ""must visit"" area for that kind of thing. I didn't have as much time for shopping here as I would have liked (just one evening, that was not enough for me), but it's worth it. Every Korean cosmetic brand (and lots of Western, I think some other Asian brands too) has a shop (or five) here. Be sure to shop around and track what you're doing, as one shop to the next might have totally different promos (in the same brand - ex: one Etude House might have a huge promo on masks, but you walk down the street and a different Etude House won't have the mask promo but a promo on foundation or something). I actually liked shopping in the Ewha district a little more, because it wasn't as hectic and there were still lots of options for cosmetics and fashion (I think the prices were better too). There's tons of fashion stores too, including a nice Uniqlo. A lot of brands have flagship shops here, you can browse for hours. There was even a Samsung Fashion store. Since we were only here for one evening, I'm not sure about restaurants in the area, but there is plenty of street food to be had, and that's what we snacked on while we shopped. I definitely recommend coming here if you want to shop for branded fashion or cosmetics, but if you want more of an ""indie"" feel (and you are looking for women's fashion) I would recommend Ewha. Meyongdong is also not a good place if you can't handle large crowds."
Fantastic place for shopoholics,"This place has got everything you can ever imagine! starting from regular trade marks and luxurious brands shops to street market with fake bags and accessories to any taste. There is also sort of local pottery and souvenirs market where you can find amazing cutleries and porcelain plates, magnets, souvenirs and even fures. You should visit!"
Lots of stores,Lots of shopping if you're interested in it. However I wouldn't say this is the most impressive shopping area that I've been to.
Fashion in the Day. Fun street Food at Night.,"Excellent place. During the day you can shop in higher end boutique fashion shops. But it is best to come in the evening and eat all sorts of cheap food form the street stalls. From skewered meats, seafood on sticks, savoury rolls, to sweets cakes, fresh juice, etc. ... Wonderful variety. Fun busy atmosphere."
Just wow !,"A shopping heaven! Especially for face masks and make up and a bit of everything! It's quite easy to get lost as there are shops of the same name everywhere, it's like if u miss a shop, you will find it in the next corner! But be careful of the saleswomen, they are like bees and we are like flowers, scary sometimes! Of course one thing to be sure is that you need to find the will to resist your temptation! ( from buying goods, face masks etc) there are some snacks/ street food too in the evening.... smell wonderful! It's like causeway bay in hk, princess street in Edinburgh but crazier! There are some nice cafes too. "
Crowded but not cheap.,This area is worth visiting fur the fun of it and to taste different food But not for the prices or shopping. 
The word says it all; HYPER SHOPPING!,"One of the busiest areas in Seoul and sometimes not the most pleasant one. Thank god we had a wonderful and tranquil hotel to ease our minds and regain our sanity, because this place will make you crazy. Loud music, the same shops over and over again, everything revolves around beauty and cosmetics...it is all a bit tiresome."
Shopping heaven,"Honestly i went there just to try the street food. So many cosmetics shop. I love their LUSH store as the promoter are really nice, helpful & generous comparing to other LUSH store in Seoul. Come early as everything close down by 10pm :("
Korean cosmetic hunter,"If you are fans of korean cosmetic this is really the place..Not only that, you also can taste korean street food here in very affordable priceShoes, bags, and all fashion stuff are available here in very affordable price (in my opinion). I really can go 'crazy' to visit each store..But a bit hard to find public toilet so my tour guide ask me to use the toilet at Ibis Hotel near myeongdong street before strolling around..Can't wait to be back there!!!"
Shop 'til you drop!,"Myeongdong is known as the shopping mecca of Seoul, where you can find cosmetics, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. There are also several authentic korean restaurants and delicious street foods in Myeongdong. A must visit for tourist visitng Seoul! I Love Myeongdong!"
Can't save monry,"Too many to shop,all the Korea famous makeup shop located in,and so many good restaurants,after 5:00 pm you could find a lot of local street foods on the road ,don't forget try the traditional eggs cakes it s so Yummy.Enjoy;)"
Cosmetics stores everywhere ,"We went to Myeongdong to buy some cosmetics. We didn't have to search for the cosmetic stores, they where everywhere. Apart from that, they have alot of different food and snack stalls.Most of the stores closes at 23:00 "
A must visit,Make a note to visit this place when you are in Seoul. It's a great market with excellent vibe. We went on a Saturday and it was buzzing with a lot of people. The choice of shops is brilliant especially for the ladies as they have hundreds of cosmetic shops.
Busy street on Saturday even in train ,"Good restaurants including dessert cafe. Lots of shopping Uniqlo, Korean cosmetics etc street food. Lots of small streets, people, tourists, tax refund shop."
A very nice place to shop,"I love Myeondong shopping street. There are plenty of shops for beauty, restaurants, food stalls and all other vendors. Just go inside the shops i.e. facehops, etude etc and you will get free facial mask... It is exit 8 of Myeondong station. I just found out that Nature's Republic Building in the corner of the street is the most expensive building in Myeondong and the best noodles in SK is found in Myeondong too."
Quite fun and busy!!,"This place is teeming with shops, mostly beauty shops that have free giveaways at the entrance. Check them out! You can also get your streetfood fix here. But if you want some peace and quiet, I recommend NOT checking in here. "
"Complete selection, but really crowded.","Went here on a Friday evening. For girls, this would be a one-day stop. So many shops, especially for cosmetics and skincare. Almost all the salespeople speak Chinese too. Not too much to see for guys, maybe some street food. But even then I think they may be overpriced. They do have more variety of street food than other shopping districts though.I personally prefer Hongdae. More selection for guys, less crowded, younger vibe, slightly less touristy."
Awesome time at the shopping Myeondong Shopping Street,"My family and I spend the late morning and early afternoon walking, shopping, eating, and simply enjoying the vibe. It's located near (walking distance - literally across the major roadway) Namdameum Market, so it's easy to do both if your up for it. "
Korean cosmetic galore,"Myeongdong has two sides. Come in the morning it may just seem like your pedestrian only shopping street (bar some motorcyclists). However come after the sun sets and the vibe completely changes. Shop vendors are out in force trying to you persuade every passerby to buy what they have to offer. But unlike other countries their attitude is respectful and not forceful. Street vendors with Korean delicacies fill the walkway and is a spectacle in itself. Do wonder through the small alleyways which deviate off the main strip as there are gems to be found. For those shopping till you drop, Myeongdong is a great base for first timers in Seoul. You will always find a nice place to eat and shop at all hours. The only downside is if a bus full of tourists come along best avoid the same store.Highly recommend the strawberry juice it was so good I had to have one everyday. "
Shopping & Street food,"There are many shops everywhere, some have really good deals, others are chain stores where the price are pretty much the same. Expect most of the food are fried but you've got to try some of them. Great fun experience as I walk through the area with my family. "
Skincare shops here sold cheaper than the duty free shops!,"I bought some branded green tea cleansing foam at a duty free shop at US$6 each, yet to my surprise the same product at the branch shop of the brand at Myeongdong was only sold at W8,000 for buy one get one, i.e. W4,000 each, which is about US$3.5 only!!So good!"
Only Cosmetics,Been to this market and all the market in the city.... Myeondong is only best for cosmetics and some street food... close to metro station.... not very big... many offers on cosmetics.... There are many market in the city... you should know what to buy and visit that market accordingly.
great shopping area for cosmetics and skincare !!!,"simply too many shops ...innisfree is my favourite !no more free mask samples. they need you to enter the shop and listen to their sales talk before they give you the free sample masks. most of the time, the sales staff speak chinese. although i can speak chinese but i am not from china. i dont really feel good. wish they can just speak korean or english. besides this, the shops are simply too many to finish shopping in just one day !...the streetfood is tasty though bit expensive..."
So vibrant and pleasant,So lively and vibrant with so many pictures and songs you can hear of Kpop and kdrama actors if you are into it. Cheap buys. the giveaways for the beauty shops are not given unless you go inside. 
one stop shop for just about anything you could need or uselessly want...,"as the description states... theres alot of junk to buy, but theres also some shops off the beaten path that provide extremely cheap custom work (as compared to american pricing); for instance i got 3 full tailored suits made in 2 days with a slew of options built in with awesome materials, shoes, custom hats to match, shirts, vests, the whole nine-for 200$USD! and there are electronics, and small batch manufacturing shops in there too!"
Something for everyone ,Lot of little shops and many different street venders. Go hungry! The food was all good and the shops are reasonably priced. We went at 9 o'clock pm and left around 11 o'clock pm. A lot of the workers speak English too!!!
"A plethora of shopping, feasting, sights and sound.","Theme: Shops, eateries, hotels/guest-houses, people. A dense shopping district with all kinds of branded and local goods. There are more shops in the Myeongdong MRT/underground/subway, too. Lookout for bargains in basement supermarkets - for souvenirs and local snacks (Lotte, etc). Street food galore - must try - the variety of popular food culture/snacks from different parts of Korea will be here.I stayed at a neighbourhood guest-house (Sunshine) - economical, friendly, cozy, clean and comfortable - conveniently located just 2 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping area but a stones throw from the MRT entrances and the airport bus shuttle stop.p.s. drop in to the Cathedral right behind the shopping belt to get away from the excitement and din to rest your mind and tired feet. Also visit Namsan Park, Namsan Folk Village, Millennium Capsule and make your way to N Seoul Tower (try the funicular lift and ride the cable car) to catch a more scenic side of the city and breathtaking views from high above. Cannot miss the 'love-locks' decorations everywhere which adds such vibrant tones to the natural backdrop. I went right before dusk - gorgeous sunset scene from atop the mountain."
Lively night seen after the shops close,"You must walk up and down the streets of Myeongdong as they are akin to the night street stalls of Hong Kong. Very lively, entertaining and exciting. "
Shop until you fall,"A place that you gotta visit carefully :)) Take your time, look around shops, decide what exactly you need to buy and which shop offers something that you need. Almost every shop offers tax refund when you purchase is 30.000 won or more. So to avoid unnecessary purchases take a thorough look through the offers first ;)And of course try local street food, it is absolutely safe to eat and delicious!!!"
What to expect and other tips,"The area is filled with beauty and cosmetic shops. I went in a few of them but did not buy anything. These beauty stores IMO are aimed for younger people. The prices are much cheaper in Korea if you used these brands e.g. Innisfree, Tonymoly, Etude House, Skinfood, Nature Republic, Face Shop, Banila, Missha, etc. Print coupons from the Korea Tourism website, you either get discount or bonus face masks. Bring your passport as many of these stores offer instant store discount if you spent over a certain amount. Usually as low as $50US. There aren't a lot of clothing stores but I did find myself attracted to the supermarkets and accessories stores. Art Box has a lot of different things other than stationary like the stores in California, kinda like the Watson's in Taiwan and Hong Kong but cheaper. SPAO and Giordano were much more expensive in Korea fyi. Monologue was the only clothing store I managed to buy some decent tops without a hefty price tag or cheap materials. About $15-$20 US. The Line app store has a lot of fans taking photo with the gigantic brown bear. Lots of restaurants that I recommend trying rather than relying on street foods alone. Food at the street vendors were much more expensive than any other Asian countries I have visited. e.g. a quail egg baked on a piece of bread no bigger than the size of an egg for $6US, or $5US for a cup of pomegranate juice. They were not yummy either. Too many selling the same items, and too many spicy rice cake - garaetteok. But I am still glad I got to try them. That's what vacations are for - to explore new things. :)Money exchange is the best in Myeongdong area. We have exchanged money three times at three different stores, and the rate was always the same as or better than what we looked up on xe or oanda. And no fees! Bring your passport!!Most stores are opened by 11am. Go after 6 pm for all the food vendors but not after 1030-ish. We went searching for food after arriving at our hotel at 1030pm, the vendors were sparse and we ended up grabbing some snacks from 7-11."
Nothing other than cosmetics shops,"Won't go back unless visiting some named restaurants there. Then again, can find alternatives elsewhere. Too crowded and nothing much to shop. Go if you want to buy local made cosmetic."
Loved this area,"Great shops, amazing street food and cool little cafes and bars!! Very vibrant area and open late every night!!"
Organised chaos with lots of fun!,"The place is so happening after sunset. Everybody is looking for something. The shops are looking for customers n the shoppers are looking for good bargains. Free masks if you enter their shops. The shops tend to repeat n reappear after a few steps. Don't worry if you miss one because the same one will show up again later unless it is a unique one. Bargain is the game. Once you hit rock bottom for the price, they will try to keep you happy by giving you additional free gifts. I leave when I have enough as the shopkeepers need to sustain too. Lots of drinks n food everywhere. Niche restaurants are tugged away but if you can find them, you will enjoy good old traditional Korean meals. "
Shopping Mecca of Seoul,"If you like to shop, this is where you want to be. This area has all the major shops and a lot of vendors on the street as well. You definitely will not find a shortage of face masks or Korean bbq. This area seems to be crowded no matter what time you go. A good place to go if you're looking for a shopping spree!"
Standard shopping street,This place is no different from any shopping streets in other countries. You will see a lot of clothing and food stores along the street. If you come after 5pm you will find many food stalls on the street but it is not cheap.
Amazing,"Great shopping, great food. Recommend night time as shops are still open and food stalls and street vendors are more active."
Great If You Love MakeUp and Skin Care,Every third store front sells a form of makeup and or skin care products. There is a lot of repetition in this area. There are also several tasty restaurants and food stalls that are out at night. 
Shopping heaven,Myeongdong has everything as shopping place and open till quite late compared to other place. Its good for first timer who would like to experience korea shopping alley and foods. 
Shopping heaven,"Probably my favourite place to shop after Myeongdong! Sadly most of the cosmetic shops here are repeats of one another, so there's no need to explore the entire area. But there's lots of food and shops here regardless, great to spend an afternoon here."
Shopping and street food heaven,"Typical shopping and food district in Seoul.Was there in the early evening, very crowded but with a good atmosphere- lots of locals and tourists. Shops galore - things are expensive compared to other Asian countries. Street food looks good and delicious but no where to sit and eat. Plenty of restaurants to choose from."
Sensory overload and more beauty products that you will ever need,"This is a hectic area of Seoul which is a magnet for tourists. Narrow streets, packed with shoppers lined with food stalls and shops selling beauty products, Myeongdong is an extreme shopping experience! Not for the claustrophobic... this is an terrific area to pick up the latest in Korean cosmetics and youthful fashions (don't expect to be allowed to try everything on, some shops have a no-trying policy). Wandering the narrow streets is great fun, around every corner you see something unexpected (foot high ice cream cones anyone?) English and Chinese are widely spoken. Things to buy: glasses (lenses can be fitted in an hour or so for many prescriptions), face masks and cosmetics (look out for the sales people offering free samples as you enter the shop), K-pop products (socks featuring G-Dragon anyone?!)Things to eat: sugar dipped potato chip spirals on a stick, lobster with cheese (really!), squid, ice cream sandwiches, fried chicken. anything which is calorific, delicious and of dubious nutritional value.To avoid: weekends are really, really busy!"
FUN,It's really the best area to be especially at night. There is a festive atmosphere with all the bright lights and street food vendors . The stores close late at night which is great so you can do your sightseeing during the day and shop at night.
Great Vibe at Night,"Lots of lights, shops and food stalls in the evening. Not a huge shopper, especially make up. Heaps of make up stores.Ignore that, go for vibe and food!"
Cosmetic store..lots of it,If u are beauty freak this must be paradise..lots of tenant are beauty store..some are fashion store and snack store..its quite crowded when I visited better not losing your way haha..worth to see anyway
Wonderful!,"If you are visiting Seoul, you must stay at Myeongdong - it's close to everything; shopping, eating... "
Beutifull,"A must see.All smells of Korea.Street food, and plenty of people to mingle.Just walked around. Plenty of restraints and bars. I tried traditional only, they were great"
Many Stores and Street Vendors,We were told we should go to this area to shop and eat as it was popular. Too bad we had already eaten as there were a lot of food carts with great looking food. It is really long and you could shop for a long time. This area was much better than the Namdaemun Market area which was closer to our hotel but had more lower scale food and trinket carts. It also closed up much earlier. (To Travel Is To Live)
Crowded and full of aggressive shop workers,"the Shopping street is very crowded, which is to be expected. the biggest issue is the abundance of stores selling facial products whose staff assualt you as you walk past and get annoyed if you don't buy anything. "
Shops all around!,"Love stopping by here during my trip to Korea to visit relatives! A ton of great shopping both brand and little pop up style shops. This is a good spot for both luxury and on a budget type of shoppers. There's a range of things to shop for such as clothes, shoes, accessories, knick knacks, handbags, etc. And on top of that if you get hungry while walking around there are always cafes, street food, and restaurants in between shops on pretty much every block!"
Must do while visiting Seoul!,"Such a lively shopping area that becomes even livelier at night! I walked through this area during the day and loved it. Its full of great shops and food! Even better, as the sun sets, food vendors line the streets with so many amazing choices. Visit at night if possible. The stores stay open late and its just a fun atmosphere."
Excellent shopping street,A blend of international and local brands in glitzy shops. Clean and nice to wander through. If you like shopping you will love it here.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Shops everywhere ,"This is a must-go-to place in Seoul if you like shopping! You take the (very easy) subway to Myeongdong station and (depending on which exit you use) head down to the right and you literally get thrown into the shopping-craze! There are small shops left and right, store attendants shouting (in a nice way) at you to walk into their store pushing free samples into your hands. In the middle of the streets there are food stalls where you buy goods like Ddeokbokki and fried shrimps to-go and then you sit down on steps to a store to eat it or if you're daring you eat it on the go. "
Lively shopping area,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is the place for cosmetic- and facial-crazy shoppers. One finds stores lined-up across and beside each other trying to entice you to enter their establishment with free give-aways- even f you don't purchase anything from them. On leaving the area, you'll probably be still loaded with facial creams and the like without actually buying anything. There are also shops with named brands such as Giordano, Uniqlo, Adidas and the sort. Interspersed among the shops are eateries, restos, cafes and of course Seoul's famous street food. Prepare to stay for 3-4 hrs (perhaps even more if you're really into make-up) . Myeongdong Station Line 4. Exit 6"
Myeongdong will make you insane,"Love this place so much, I love skin care and street food and this place offer both of it, so this is a must go place to visit. I made a vblog during my trip to seoul, come and watch my video for your references to create your very own itinerary. search title :#3 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 2 JEJU - NATURE"
Fun with Lots of Street Food,This is a lively area with plenty of stores and street food. My kids loved trying all different types of food and ice cream. Definitely worth a visit. 
Food street..,Myeong dong has various kind of food street in the evening..We can enjoy shopping and delicious food street ..
cosmetic paradise,"For all those who want to buy cosmetics and facial care products, Myeondong is hard to beat. Prices are competitive too with offers which can rival the duty free shops. There are also one for one offers which can change by the day. Hence, going to the same shop can give you a better deal on a product on a different day. Only problem is that it's all by chance as we don't quite know when an offer appears until the day itself. Maybe if you can speak korean, the staff would be able to let you know although I haven't come across anyone who has had this privilege. "
Best place to shop,"This market is one of the best and largest market in Seoul. You will find all type of shops here including cosmetics, clothing, food, etc.. "
Shopping paradise,It's truly a shopping paradise not only for ladies with so many cosmetic but also for men as well.Take the sky train Myeongdong shopping street and everything could be found from here.Noted to look for shops that have promotion / discount items
One of the best places in Seoul for shopping lovers like me (and who don't have too much money to spend),"Vibrant place with narrow streets and full of light at night. Tons of shops for cosmetics and souvenirs, lots of nice food spots, subway nearby. Also advise to visit underground shopping mall with 'Made in Korea' clothes and jewelry."
Too Busy & Crowded! ,"Went here just for the novelty... Too busy & crowded. You have to push towards the people who for some reason chose to be at the middle of the street than eat beside street food stalls. Food stalls are good but pricey, tourist price. The only good point for me are the road shops, bought my fave skincare & got generous freebies! ;-)"
I loved it!,"I visited Myeong Dong, in Seoul a few days ago. It's the best place for shopping. You can see a lot of restaurants, shopping malls, street food and any other dining options. One of the busiest areas in Seoul I believe. I love the vibes in Myeong-Dong and I'll definitely come back again when I was in Seoul."
Cosmetics and more ,"Love the vibrancy there. All the popular brands of skincare congregate there. The jostling and pushing through the crowd while touters shoving free masks into our hands and coaxing us to enter their shops. Every 50 meters you will see a repeat of the same brand side by side each other. It's good to shop for better deal as each shop has different promotion and free gifts. By 4 pm the landscape change with the food carts and others setting up business there. Lots to see , eat ,shop or just people watch. "
commercial,totally commercial place..Visit here if you want to buy things with high price (only street things. except brand store).
amazing!!!!!!!!!!,"full of shops of all sorts and stalls, the food stalls are a must try and very reasonably priced, everyone speaks english and is extremely kind and accommodating"
A little bit too crowded.,"Maybe it was original at one time, but now - not so much. I hear more Chinese or English from tourists than Korean."
All Skin care products ,There are so many skin care products that all around. Street foods are mostly deep fried. It is such a busy area that girls can easily spend a day . 
"So many shops, so many delicious things to eat!!!","If you are into cosmetics, you can find anything any everything here! Plus, if you are a night owl like me, it's pumping till midnight with food vendors and all kinds of stores! There was a money exchange place that gave better exchange than at the airport. There was also a police booth for tourists who needed information. It felt very safe and comfortable!"
"Amazing!!!! Food, Culture and Fashion!!","Here you can find anything from hair salons to clothing stores and cosmetics stores galore. The Lotte department stores offer every brand from Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and the like. Street shopping is so fun and safe. "
Vibrant shopping with plentiful eateries that sell more or less Exactly the same type of food,Nice and vibrant shopping area. Night market with food stalls selling at ridiculously expensive price for poor quality stoggy street food targetting tourists starts around 6pm.
Wear comfy shoes and prepare to splurge. ,"Lots of choices, but can get a bit repetitive. Good to visit 2 or 3 times for one trip in order to get everything you want. Korean beauty products galore!"
Shopping heaven... and also great for food!,"The atmosphere is busy but relaxed. You can smell street food before you get there and hear tourists trying to bargain for a better price. No one bothers you as you walk through, they just smile and say hello. Looking at the pictures gives you a taste of what its like to shop in Myeongdong, but you really have to experience it yourself instead of relying on reviews.Grab some street food and walk around at first. If you see something you like, note where it is and how much. Then explore some more, you may find it cheaper as you go along. The food, well thats just to keep you occupied. its tastes good too!Seoul has many districts like this one but i definitely recommend visiting Myeongdong.And for the ladies... Skincare and makeup products galore! You can easily fill a bag with free samples!"
Great place for shopping,It's a heaven for people that love cosmetics. You can get a lot of cheap face mask and free sample cosmetics too. The place is also full of cafe and street food.
shopping!,"It's a great place to shop for skincare and make up. If I ever run low, I think I will make a trip to Korea to buy them. They give you one for one or free things or samples but only if you look hesitant. I was buying something for a friend and the assistant knew I was going to get it no matter what so I didn't get much. Some assistants (Chinese) are very rude and will tell you to scram if you don't buy."
Must visit for street food,The one stop location to try all Korean street food. This place comes alive only from late afternoon onwards till about 10pm. There are main shops along the streets that one can find all skincare brands you'll ever need. Start walking from Myeongdong Station Exit 6 where the Uniqlo is and go along the street stalls. 
Immerse in the atmosphere!,"I enjoyed being part of the scene which I have always read about! Can find almost every other brand of Korean skincare and cosmetic product here - most of the major brands have at least 2 outlets. It is totally a shopping heaven for me as some of the brands and products are not commonly found back home. Laneige products are definitely a great deal after tax refund and the discounts given! While most shops are not as active in giving masks or products to ""lure"" you into their shop as I had read previously, it is more about getting products I really needed and not on impulse.The street food at night is a scene to experience as well, but they are not cheap at all! The street lobster stall, I overheard, was more than 10,000 won. Quite pricey if you thinking about street food standard. But there were many other things to see and buy (socks, accessories, stationary) and many restaurants to choose from (but mostly only korean food only). There is a store selling toasted sandwich which is delicious!"
Shopping and dining,Myeongdong is crowded with tourists. Things much more expensive than other places in Seoul. A clear tourist trap. Only personal heath are products are priced fairly. Erwa woman University has better offers and prices half of that to Myeongdong.
FUN!,"We visited this area every day of our 6 day stay in Seoul… we liked it that much. It was fun to wander down the side streets also… lots of interesting places to eat. The shops all started to look the same after awhile… in fact there is a repeat of the same cosmetic shops throughout the area. The merchants that hustled us to go into their shops were sometimes persistent… and a bit annoying… but the excitement and ambiance of the entire area outweighed the pesky merchants. We especially loved all the yummy street food, and found it more exciting to walk around at night, with all the lights and action."
Tourist Spot,"Many street foods with variable prices from 3,000 won,5k won to 10k won.Because it was raining, we enter small shop local cuisine which we just found out its very expensive price.We spent 54k just for 1 portion porridge,1 portion jjangmyeon(black bean noodle) and fried chicken.Just be aware when we enter shop.Better enter the shop which have a menu with price list.but myeongdong shopping street must visit place when in Korea.So many stalls like cloth stall and socks also."
Myeongdong Street Food - Must Indulge,"Myeondong is a must-experience place when in Seoul. The best time to go there is when the street markets are already set-up (7pm - wee hours of morning). You can find established cosmetic shops all over, while in the middle of the road are street food stalls. We had street food dinner during our Day 1 in Seoul - definitely, a must-indulge experience.I also found the best US$ to KRW exchange rate in the money exchange shops in Myeongdong."
Not really special to see,All the shops are that you can see in your country easily. What you can do is just watching shops and shopping.
Many shops to buy Kieran brand makeup,"Many shops to buy Korean brand makeup, almost all the shop provide special prices for masks and tiny samples"
Worth going!,"We were there from afternoon till night. Most shops will close by 10. There is much to do if you are into shopping. Firstly the street food is interesting and well worth trying out. The number of skin care shops is amazing. Many offered discounts with freebies thrown in. The shop assistants are mostly fluent in Chinese or English, apart from Korean. This made our shopping experience a much better one.There are plenty of restaurants as well to rest and eat.We found some shops selling really value for money items. Clothes in 1 store are cheaper than Dongdaemun. Better yet they are fixed priced so no need for bargaining. Another store sold accessories at 50% off store wide. The quality of the rings and earrings is good despite the relatively low price. After all the shopping we went to do Hanbok photo taking. Also located in the area and it was really memorable.Overall it was a fun and fulfilling day."
Where you see local shopping ,"This place caters not only to tourist like me but you meet the locals. There are plenty of korean street food and lots of clothes, cosmetic , and authentic korean food. Even at night lots of people are still crossing path."
Shopper's paradise...,"Imagine a place with a labyrinth of streets lined with shops on both sides and stacked on top of each other. The outcome is an endless array of shops which an avid shopper would not be able to cover in one day. As amazing as this place is, the shops are fairly limited in its variety and mainly cater to the fashion and cosmetic shoppers. In addition, the restaurants are generally expensive, including even the street food vendors who came out in the evening."
Nice cosmetic & fashion street!,We enjoyed the time we spent in Myeongdong very much. It has a lot shops & restaurants arounded. Love it!
A must visit,"Pretty much heaven for those who like the korean skincare and makeup. Literally every single brand is here but there is also some branded clothing. If you want the cheap one, try the underground shopping. And starting 5.30 PM or so, there are lots of street foods, another must try. Recommended!"
Shop till you drop!!!,"Lots of Skin care, street vendors and apparels. From fashion to street food. Even designers like MCM! Nails, hair, aesthetic, restaurants.. etc "
Good night and day,This is a lovely market for stores and street food. Will suit any budget and has a lovely ornate theatre in the area. Walked this both day and night. Quite safe but watch out for pick pockets. Lots of health and beauty shops here.
Not a must to go,"Its a touristy place. There's good and bad about this place. Popular stores to be found ; Aland, Style nanda, The seam, Innisfree cafe, Faceshop, Gao Feng ginseng chicken restaurant etc. Push cart food not that worth to try, portion isn't big also. Thumb down for the Zha Jiang Mian store recommended by Taiwan Variety show, don't buy ; noodle not right and sauce not right too. Besides that, there's a few stores with ""Chinese speaking"" male staff who will even ""reach out"" to customer so as to persuade them to patronize their stores. ""Chinese speaking"" female staff just kept following customer, introducing one item to another. I really dislike their hard sale method."
Loads of Fun ,What are you doing in Myeondong? What else would you be doing? Shopping for fake designer underwear and socks for your friends back home! You're eating tasty Korean food at reasonable prices and buying all your girlfriends snail-extract face masks to keep their skin young! It's safe and you'll enjoy yourselves here.
Shopping area,I love myeongdong because you can buy everything here but ofcourse since its one of the tourist spot the prices here are a bit higher compared to other same stores in other areas
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Located on exit 6,7, and 8 Myeongdong station.many shops offer you t shirt,accessories,socks,restaurants,which the prize is acceptable.you can buy T Shirt in 3000₩,food street about 1000₩-5000₩,socks 1000₩,and tey offer you cosmetics from Etude,Leinage, Natur Republic etc.Myeongdong Shopping Street open from 10am till 10pm"
Really Interesting,"It's a very interesting place. I find that it's nicer than the Gangnam shopping streets because it's more geared towards tourists than locals. Mostly Chinese and Japanese tourists, but also Indian and European and North American. Many cheap hotels and motels to be found. Lots of great street food. Lots of really cheap massage places. Lots of currency exchange places. The other great thing about visiting Myeongdong, is that it's connected to Namdaemun Market, which is a gigantic indoor/outdoor market that sells food, clothes, household items, vitamins, imported goods, you name it they have it."
Must see destination ,"The most famous shipping district in Seoul. Full of people, sights (cosmetics shop people trying to lure you into by giving our free face mask) and lots of yummy street food. For cosmetics, just stick to the larger outlets of each brand as they offer better shipping experience. Must try street food include hotteok, boneless chicken feet, grilled cheese and strawberry mochi. While multiple stores sells the same stuff, standards do differ from stall to stall."
Enjoyed it,"Meyongdong shopping street is very big and located in the almost city center place. They have many different shops especially my beloved line friends. From late afternoon, the night market begins with lots of different street food. "
Good for street foods but not for cosmetics ,Loads of street stalls for delicious snacks.. U can stroll along the area and eat til full. Many cosmetic shops but not the best deal in the city. Go to shopping mall duty free levels may have a better price for the same goods. 
Fashion and Beauty,"Lots of fashion outlets and beauty outlets.The shopping belt is divided into different corners and alleys within the same vicinity. You might be spoilt for choices. Clothes, cosmetics, face masks, shoes, bags etc.Also getting lots of attention is soft ice-cream at a height of 30cm."
One of the worst shopping street I have been,"I have been to many shopping streets such as in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore... Not cheap, nothing good, and nothing extraordinary. Even for cosmetics, you probably could buy the same thing elsewhere with the same price."
Very good for shopping,There are many shops including brand name shops. Food were not very expensive and the taste were good.
A lot of fun!,"The food vendors are safe. Probably safer than the US. It is fun and reasonable to walk down the streets in the area eating as you go. There are lots of restaurants. Soup restaurants, Andong chicken restaurants, dessert cafes. The desserts were expensive, but one was more than enough for 2 people to share.We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong which was right around the corner. Great location."
Cosmetic Bargains Galore!,"After reading other reviews on shopping in this district of Seoul, I have found them to be quite accurate!I am always searching for unique and cost effective items wherever in the world I travel. I make an effort to avoid tourist trap shops so, I dove into Myeondong in the evening picking up last minute buys before I headed back to the States. I was struck by the many street food vendors, which I could not resist. After fishcake snacks on a stick, vendors were literally tossing facial masks at you to entice you into their shops. The shops duplicate themselves, at least 3-4 of the same shop can exist on one block alone. Once you accept a facial mask, of course one feels obligated to go in, browse around and pick up something. For example In one shop, I purchased 20 facial masks for 5.90 WON. At the current exchange rate, approximately less than $5.00USD. The buys are there.From cosmetics and a few scattered clothing shops, and costume jewelry, I would recommend this area for landing great cosmetic deals and a festive yummy street food scene."
Great shopping for skin care products,"It is a great shopping place for skin care and costmetics. It has most of the korea brands there. In fact for some brands, there could be more than 1 shops. Look out for sales as sale in 1 outlet might not be present in another outlet though they can just be a stone away. "
Crazy!,"I suppose I should be used to Asian shopping streets by now, but it seems I am not. Myeongdong is bright, vibrant, full of locals and foreigners alike, shopping in a range of shops that start at small and rather mysterious and move on up to big, bright, fancy, loud. Interspersed are restaurants and some street food that is mystifying, scary, and - often - smelling really good. Not that I can identify much of what's on offer. Korea has much the same attitude about shopping that Japan does (as much of the world seems to as well), treating it as an activity rather than a necessity, an event, a day or night out. I can't quite get my head around that idea, but I must say that Myeongdong is an experience. Once, however, was enough for me."
Great shopping area,"This is a great shopping area, and a must to visit if you are staying nearby. There are many shops and restaurants in the area. In the evening, the streets come alive when the night market starts. There is a good range of products being sold, from food to clothing. Many tourists throng the streets eating and buying."
A must place to go if your are a tourist.,If you are a fan of Cosmetics or you're shopa-holic then Myeongdong Shopping Street is for you. Some stores even offer 1+1 (Buy 1 Get 1) and the best thing if you buy some cosmetics here there's a freebies!!! Some stalls even selling KPOP Merch. (but a little bit pricey) There's also lot of restaurants and street food stalls around. 오뎅 (Fish Cake) and 순대 (Blood Sausage) are my favorite! :)
Very lively!,"It's one of my favorite places in Seoul. A lot of things to offer! Street food is everywhere, and mind you, it's clean! A lot of good deals from different shops too. Koreans are nice, and polite. Ask for a discount, and they'll give you. "
Place to shop,This is the place to walk around in and see the small shops where you can find almost anything. Street food galore!
Skin care shops & Street food,It's overwhelming with so many people. Go there if you have lots of energy. The skin care stores are repetitive - same brands/stores on every block or every other block. There are a lot of street food in this area too.Good Experience South Korea's skin care/cosmetic culture. 
Lots of shopping,Great area for shopping for beauty products. Lots to see. Lots of food stalls. Great place for people watching. 
Not for the faint of heart,"Myeongdong is everything the blogs say it is, and more. Imagine one district/street dedicated to just shopping. K-Beauty brands and coffee shops line every which direction. You'll never be left wanting for places to buy skincare and makeup. There's also a lot of street food in the middle of the street, so if you get hungry from all that walking, it's guaranteed that a food stall can cater to your tastes. First-timers in Seoul should definitely make plans to visit this area. (Myeongdong is also close to N. Seoul Tower and Myeongdong Cathedral) Here are the things that I wasn't so fond off in this area. First of all, if a source online tells you to nab all the free samples offered to you by the sales attendants, that information is sorely outdated. While some salesladies and gents will indeed offer you a free mask or two, taking them means you are willing to go inside the store to look at their products. You can't just take the samples and walk away from them. Some even tug the samples away from you if they notice you have no plans on coming inside. The only time I got samples was when I bought the 10+10 masks, with some extra products. The samples come with the purchase.Next, don't be pressured to hoard skincare products here in Myeongdong. I sadly discovered too late that I could have saved my Won if I had visited a Duty Free store before I went mad with masks in Myeongdong. Duty Free shops, such as Lotte, Shilla, and Doota, will probably sell more mask bundles for a cheaper price. For example, what would usually be a 10+10 deal in one branch for 30,000 won was upgraded into a 50+50 mask deal for USD 40 at the Duty Free. I even found LANEIGE products were cheaper in the Doota Duty Free mall in Dongdaemun as compared to the ones in Myeongdong (i.e. the Water Bank Essence was only 13,500 won in Doota, while it retailed for around 20,000+++ won in Myeongdong.) Bottomline: some deals will be better in Myeongdong, while some will be better in Duty Free. Be a discerning shopper and try not to panic buy just because you think you won't find a much better deal somewhere else. Korea is all about their beauty products so you'll find Tony Moly's, Etude's, and Innisfrees EVERYWHERE. Not just in Myeongdong. Lastly, I have to comment on the expensive street food. The way I did my research, I thought street food in Korea would be much, much cheaper. That was the way bloggers wrote about it too. But upon looking at what they had to offer, they were selling food items for as high as 15,000 won for just one piece! (Including the strawberry mochi cakes!) In my currency, that's around Php 660!!! Insane inflation!!! I would advise some caution when it comes to purchasing Myeongdong street food too. Some items are worth the price and are very cheap, like the freshly squeezed juice, the 32cm ice cream, and the egg cakes. But the others are too expensive for my taste. I could have used that money to buy a whole meal set in a sit down restaurant. To name a few, the 15,000 won lobster tail (though I get that lobsters must be a bit expensive), the gimbap for at least 5,000 won, and the battered shrimp that's more batter than shrimp. Tip: Go to INSADONG for cheaper and more delicious street food. The most I spent there was 2,000 won for 6 pieces of delicious taiyaki! All in all, Myeongdong is an experience first-timers should definitely go for, but don't get too lost in the moment that you forget to be smart about your money and your purchases. I'd probably go back here the next time I go to Seoul, but I'd try to avoid the suffocating crowds as much as possible (aka lean seasons are probably better for the claustrophobic!)"
Shop Shop Don't Stop,"Myeongdong is a must-not-miss shopping street. I loved all the make-up shops and you'll be happy to know most salespeople can speak English. Lots of restaurants around, but they're naturally priced for tourists. There's also the street food you must not miss. I suggest you walk through Myeongdong at night when the vibe is hip and the energy is high. Just remember to head home before the metro closes!"
Korean street restaurants ,"Korea has normal sit in restaurants, but to get the feel of authentic Korean go sit and eat at one of Koreas street restaurants, these are the hidden gems, usually mom and pop places "
Definitely a place to go in Seoul,"We stayed at the Metro Hotel right in this neighborhood and never tired of the food stalls and shops along the lively streets in the area. Restaurants, shops, street food abound. Try the shaved ice deserts, and the Maple Tree restaurant for barbecues. Unfortunately the fish shaped waffle with ice cream you get at the street food stall is not as good as it looks. "
SO SO SHOPPING PLACE,"Was here a few days ago. JUst come back to Singapore yesterday. People were talking so wonderfully to buy their cosmetic and skin care products and claims that you will get alot of free products sample from here which i don't experience it.The tax free rules is minimum purchase of 30,000.00 WON. Some can do direct tax free on the spot, some have to go to airport to claim the tax. Note that it is not 100% tax claimable. Only a certain percentage only. There are offers sometime on the cosmetic and skincare products. People are saying that free samples are given generously to any purchase, it is not true. They are NOT generously at all. Don't be fool by it. I went to Lotte Duty free mall too, do not buy from the normal cosmetic or skincare counter at the lower floor, they have a level which is for tourist direct tax free at level 12 (I think) where you can buy the skincare and cosmetic. The pice is alot different, the items there are all in US dollar. After calculation, the price is still cheaper than buying in Singapore. They don't give free samples generously too. The staff looks like you owe them alot of money. You can replanish your skincare and cosmetic products stock in Lotte Duty Free mall, Brands like History of whoo, Hera, Sulwaso and other international high end brands, but don't expect ALOTS of free samples. No such thing. They only give a few or upon request. Same as Myeongdong Shopping place. If you you want something more than the norms, you have to request it.You need to planned what you are looking for. Big brand should buy in the Mall, so that no hassle for the tax problem. You won't find high end brand such Whoo, Sulwaso, Hera in Myeongdong shopping, but IOPE, Laneigh, Etude, Skin food, etc is there. Hope this review helps if you are going there."
never tired of walking it,"so much to see and eat, and of course buy! prices are also targeted at tourists. multi lingual salespersons abound. at some points, there are also guides dressed in red who would be very pleased to help you with directions or recommendations."
Cosmetics Shopping Good Street Food,It's cosmetics paradise with all Korean brands present. We found it to be the single largest concentration of cosmetics shops in Seoul. Staff in most shops have English speakers. Daily discounts are on and they throw freebies if you buy over an amount. We didn't find the duty free shops Lotte etc great as they tend to stock the global brands. We just went berserk shopping here. And the street food options are many and varied. 
A must visit,"A must visit shopping street in Seoul. Street snack stalls were set up in the evening. The snacks were great, although the prices were on the high side. Cafes, restaurants, convenience stores and all kinds of shops were abundant. Great vibe and ambience."
Shop 'til you drop,Do not even think that you will manage seeing all the stores in a few days of stay. There are so many that I am still recovering from all the walking.
Wonderful shopping and eating,"Enjoyed the busy streets and the variety of shops around! Hawkers food carts were great, also there were many places for eating - you name it and surely you can find it!"
Good shopping place,"Good shops, but be careful of the fake items. First ask the prices and compare. Prices are different here"
Depends what you're looking for,"This seemed the shopping area for cosmetics, and food. It was always bustling, but easy to navigate to train station, department stores, etc. Many of the cosmetic stores repeated, and when you buy something they give you samples - love it!Don't forget to ask for a tax receipt if you spend over 5000Won - you can claim the tax back"
Sale sale sale,We were here last February and they had the winter sale 50-70% off on different stores and there was a street sale . Then now that its summer they have the same sale . MOstly on cosmetic products though . And oh ! Dont forget the street food ...
Overpriced tourist shopping spot.,"Lots and lots of skincare, makeup products - overrated spot with lots of tourists and the price is a rip off. Though they said its a must visit spot but actually there's lots of other places to shop off cheaper. Lots of street food but also priced higher than other places, but you'll be able to find a lot of varieties of products around. For people whom like to shop, it's a good place to get everything at one place. They even have the famous LINE Friends cafe around here."
So many Korean beauty products,"This is a great place if you want to buy good Korean beauty stuff, so many choices, street food are yummy and a lot to explore on the different Korean food. Clothes and women's accessories can also be found here. Affordable and enjoyable."
Beauty Products Paradise,"If you want to see what 3 different E-Tude House beauty shops have to offer within one block, this is the place to go. Blocks after blocks of face masks, face products, and other beauty products. This is, however, also the best place to go in Seoul for street food. "
Not a place for me ,I do not like this please very much. Whenever I am there it is because I am there in connection with something else. I only go there if I have to have a meeting or visit some friends. So not much love for the street because its noisy and not kept clean like the old days when i came to Korea first time. Lots have happened in 12 years I must say 
Skincare and make up everywhere,"This is probably one of the most crowded places I've been to in Seoul. It's a heaven for anyone who loves make-up and skincare products. There are several restaurants in this area as well, so walk around before you decide where you wanna eat at. Tip: come here with people who enjoy shopping as much as you do as it can get quite boring since that's all you'll be doing here."
Must visit in Seoul,"Very exciting area, full of shopping and eating possibilities. Excellent and tasty must try street food. If you're looking for the latest brand names for skin care and sports wear, you will certainly find it in Myeongdong. A huge choice of local food restaurants, of different cost levels, especially the wonderful Korean Barbecue"
Tourist Trap,Restros are little bit of everything but pricey. Shopping are filled with chainstore and street hawkers. Rather go to area close to Universities.
Stayed near Myeongdong Shopping Street,We went here almost every day. There's so much to discover. The street food is great & we ate at a few restaurants too. The shops will try to get you to go into their stores but they are super friendly & will understand when you say no. Nothing but great experiences here. 
AMAZING SHOPPING,If you like shopping this is the place to go with so many shops to see you won't know what to do with yourself. There is a good range of tasty street food along the pathways as well as some good market stalls selling clothes sunglasses and other items. If you like your beauty buys there are lots of shops that cater for this some expensive others cheaper. If you are from the UK you might get swamped by students asking you to do some quizzes and wanting a selfie (but they are very nice kind and polite so don't be worried). I'd say if you visit here you might want an empty suitcase to bring all the stuff you buy with you back home!
Many things to see and eat,"Great place to get your k beauty and shopping fix. So many shops. If you are nice you can get lots of free samples from the beauty stores. After 4 pm the food street vendors come out and the whole place becomes crazy crowded. To be honest, the street food is quite expensive. Many food items look good but only tasted so so. The swirly potato chips was a disappointment but do check out the honey comb vanilla ice cream served in a fish shaped pancake. Those were divine."
Love the street food!!,I felt like a local with the shopping and street food. I had the chance to enjoy Myeongdong 3 times out of our stay.
Myeoungdong Shopping Street,endless shopping. Lots of places to eat and if you're into Korean beauty products it is a must for your wives or girlfriends. satisfy your street food cravings !!
Tourist trap,"If you're up for a lot of shopping, a lot of people, a lot of street food, a lot of haggling for skin care--then this is the place for you! On my first visit to Seoul, I found this place very fun but after my 7th time to Seoul, I try to stay away from this area. Over the years, I've noticed that the haggling has gotten worse and if you don't speak Korean, they'll start assuming you're Chinese! The street food here is also more expensive than other places in Seoul. If you're looking for a more quaint area, check out Ehwa Women's University area--same skincare shops, less haggling, and less crowded. "
Delicious Street Food!,"So much shopping to do around this area, but the main attraction for me was the street food! Do your research and eat everything at least once! Korean street food tastes great, but may not be so great for the waistline."
Eating & Shopping - sooooo many cosmetic shops,"A great place to walk through mid afternoon and early evening. Lots of street food options (must check out the Myeongdong dumplings) including massive scalops, lobster, grilled beef, noodles etc etcIf you are looking for face, hand, feet masks this is the place to go. So many options I just bought a bunch of my stuff - not the expensive ones either. My wife is loving them"
Crazy busy ,What place to visit if you like shopping and food but be warned there are hundreds of people after 3pm 
Great area for shopping and foods!,"Myeongdong: Capitalism screaming in your face. It has a super high concentration of shops, neon lights, and food places. It is super lively and has good vibe until late in the evening"
Shopping place ,"We lived near Myeongdong station, and we shopping every night after finishing our plan. You can get street food, cosmetics, stationery here, and it's easy to exchange money, there are so many currency exchange stores on the street. If you wanna buy Korean brand cosmetics like innisfree, skinfood, laneige, tolymoly... here is the best place for you. It's lively at night! "
Full of night life!,"Fun street to come for tasting local foods, shopping for clothes and beauty products! Also has lots of restaurants around the area, dined here multiple times, although I must say that the restaurants around here have inflated prices."
Best area in town,Love this area. Lots of shops and restaurant and you can find street food as well at night. We were staying in myeongdong area and almost come to this area every night ❤️❤️
Worth a look,Place is full of people and shops. I was trying to find shot glasses but was unable to find what I was looking for. The place is great for cosmetics and there are various places to eat. They have tourist information people walking around in red cowboy hats that can answer any questions or help with directions.
"Food carts, cosmetics shoping","Was there in May 2017 and streets appears less busy ( this is a plus)due to China banning tour groups from going to South Korea.You can find all the Korean cosmetics sold here, there are multiple Innisfree, Etude house shops in this shopping area. Just a tip, I am normally late arriving at Incheon airport , however I was early this time and had a little time to walk around. I purchased an Iope skin care product (80,000 won) before tax refund (tax refund is only about 5%) at Aritatum Myeongdong and the airport was selling it for 60,000 won! Not sure if other Korean cosmetics are cheaper at the airport as I decided not worth comparing as I didn't want to find out I had paid more for all my other purchases!Food: lots of food being sold on carts. Drinks ( orange juice selling at 4000 won , maybe 5000 won ( can't remember exactly)... So in my opinion , not cheap. Stalls and most shops open till 11 pm."
Guaranteed to cause a shopaholic relapse,"Bright lights, hawkers shoving free samples in your hands, signs advertising huge discounts, all replicated every 50 metres in every direction, it's a recipe for credit card mayhem. Be careful if you can't resist!"
Crowded and great if you're looking for cosmetics,"Walked around this area around lunchtime on a Sunday just to browse at the collection of shops, which were mostly cosmetic boutiques and some clothing shops. Not a lot to interest most men :)"
Olive Young a teen paradise ,"On my family trip to visit my brother we spent some time here. My 17 year old daughter's favorite store was Olive Young as it had so many items she has seen but had to order on line. It was fun walking around looking at things, and not too crowded."
Girls skincare and cosmetic ,All the famous Korean skincare and cosmetic stores are all located in here. I went there for a one person Korean BBQ which was awesome. I like the crane machine there because I got 5 dolls in total. 
Full of life,We had several evening walk in this area which was really bursting with life. A lot of interesting street food to taste and purchase.
A bit too crowded for me,There were too many options and too many people. Most of the shops and products can be obtained at other places I think. But I did like the street food experience.
The Lively Street,"We had intentionally booked a hotel in this street as we know that it is a shopping district and lively by night. True enough, it is! The street is filled with cosmetic shops with different brands and clothing shops. There is also lots of eateries, coffee shops, convenient stores and even a bank. It is like a street mall with everything inside! At night, it is livelier with food vendors in the street and lots of people outside. You will never got tired in walking in Myeongdong."
nice but nothing special!,"hello, nice to see, walk through but nothing special when you already visited classic Asian cities .. plenty of shops and small food vendors ... guess a nice spot for cosmetic purchase."
Busy,"Huge bustling streets filled with all kinds of goods. Clothes, designer apparel, handbags and shoes. Was very fun browsing through this all. "
Become very commercial,"Myeongdong was all girls favourite shopping area, I came back after serval years, the street was kind of dirty cause there were lots of street vendor, fast food......! Comestic shop are the major business in this area, you will see young Korean man giving out free facemask sample to attrack customer. They all can speak muti languages but I found they were not too honest after I shop in serveral shop . Resturants were so crowd, food was just ok,staff wasn't friendly ! There are many other shopping option in Seoul, Myeongdong will not be on my shopping list in future visit."
ScrumptiousStreetfood and Make-up Galore,"We stayed at Royal Hotel Meongdong and went window shopping every night. Myeongdong presents a wide assortment of restaurants, fashion retail shops and make-up galore. Nanta Theater with the long running Cooking Nanta Show is here as well as the Meongdong Theater which has free weekend cultural performances. Prices here are reasonable and cheaper than at Korean department stores. But this is no place for haggling. There is a wide variety of street food from salmon to octopi to honeycomb ice cream to lobster(!) to eomuk (fish) cakes. Korean street food is by no means cheap and when we chose to have them for dinner, we ended up spending more than we would have had at a regular restaurant. By the way, the honey butter almonds and the yogurt almonds sold at a side street parallel to the famous Milky Bee Ice Cream are absolutely delicious!"
Cosmetics + Street food!,"Korean skincare is all the rage nowadays and once you step onto Myeongdong, you will be overwhelmed by all the brands, promotions and sales! Music is constantly playing, there is delicious street food you can enjoy while checking out all the stores. Plus every time you buy, you get a bunch of freebies too!"
A must see,"It is a Mecca for shoppers, especially if you love cosmetics, sneakers, sunglasses.After a bit product selection is always the same.The place is fast pacing, full of light and young."
Crowded shopping area,"I went there thrice and it was really crowded. Many people were looking things to buy like souvenirs, beauty products and different street food. It was really an interesting place for shopping and food tripping. The only thing I didn't like was the long queue at every shop I entered. There were items expensive and inexpensive and sometimes it was hard for me to choose because of varied choices. I also noticed couples outside having pictorials and a sort of romantic area for them :)"
Great Place to Eat and Shop,"Shopping and Markets close by, but the best thing here is the Street Food, great range to pick from."
Eat and Shop ,Great place to try street food. The street vendors don't come out until 2pm. Please make sure you try everything!! 
Fun street with lots of food cart,"Not sure what time the food carts are wheeled onto the street, I simply loved the variety of street food that are being sold on the street. There are spicy rice cakes, potato tornado, chestnut, noodles, banana chocolate crepes, cheese lobster etc. There are many shops selling clothes, shoes, accessories and even optical n contact lens shops besides beauty shops. Nice place to hang out for a taste of Korean street food especially evening time, besides shopping."
Really Nice places ,Nice place. Good Street food. Lots of beauty Products. Its a must-visit if you are in Seoul! Easy to take metro to myeongdong and come hungry. I fint like Street food normally but this is something else...new tastes and fin experience 
Make up haul! ,"Gosh! We were amazed by the large lines of make-up stores here. From BB creams, foundations, skin care, and other beauty products. Wow! We bought so much stuff to complete our wardrobe too. Shoes, bags, and clothes for summer. Street food is best here! Love them! "
Sights and sounds of Seoul,Pretty crowded but can still move around easily - there are many delightful offerings in the way of street food both savoury and sweet - my favourite is the spiral potato on a stick 
"Enjoy the multiple street food, shops, crowd and shopping",Best time to visit is when the streets shop are all set up by evening sunset. Try all the delicacy and thats dinner completed. Depends on your taste to buy the food or souveniers or whatever you choose. Take your time to walk and don't rush. Look for tallest icecream and local delicacies. Location near Myeongdong train station or take a cab to be here.
"Walk, Look, Try, Buy.....","Myeongdong....best visited at night... lively and bright with stalls and shops. Great street food and various goods on sale....something for everyone. The mood is casual and fun-like. If you're into Korean cosmetics, the street is lined with all of the familiar Korean cosmetic brands...you'll be spoilt for choice. I was so thrilled to fine a 'Line Friends' flagship shop there too. We visited Myeongdong a few times during my stay in Seoul and it was always a new experience..... go see yourself. Dress according to the weather as it's open-air shopping. But all's not lost as you can also hop into the shops and malls or sit in the coffeeshops and dessert shops for a short rest while enjoying a cup of coffee or slurping up a Korean ice dessert.... Do give yourself sufficient time as it's not a place to rush through or you may regret it forever...or till your next visit to Seoul..:)"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"This is the fun, vibrant place to shop with an affordable price. Must-visit. We enjoyed the time to shop. "
Fun evening,This street is great fun. Loads of really cool street food. Try cake with a fried egg or tasty fried king prawn. Plenty of shops but just stayed on the street soaking up the vibe!
First visit to seoul,First time being in Seoul and was taken to these fantastic streets. A must see and plenty of shops to by things to take home.
Brilliant day or night,"We visited late afternoon and into the evening. Fabulous choice of shops and restaurants and excellent Street food vendors. This is the place to be, it's buzzing !"
Great fun,"This street is great fun for visitors to Seoul, it starts late morning and runs through to about 10.00pm. It is actually a complex of lots of cross streets and easy at first to get a bit lost. The shops are mostly make up, cosmetics, cheap clothes, phone accessories, jewellery, stationery, toys and cafes. (Unexpectedly no hi fi, cameras and electronics that markets usually have) Many shops are repeated multiple times. The stalls are mostly fresh cooked foods, fruit, drinks and other snacks. Struck me as high quality and inexpensive. Note that it is also hygienic, with my partner we eat at lots of stalls without a worry. Honestly although it was all very casual we loved it and walked round for at least a couple of hours every day. The friendly atmosphere and friendly stall holders made the whole place a pleasure. Every major city should have a corner like this. One of the best tourist attractions in Seoul."
Looking ahead for the next visit to Myeongdong . . . .,"Came for a visit with wife, daughter and friend mid-Jan 2017 to Seoul for a week and we all loved and enjoyed Myeongdong's amazing long hours of shopping treat. You'll find ladies and men's wear collection, beauty and skin care products for women (btw also for guys), delicious bbqs and grills, plenty of tempting street food, souvenir items and the sweetest tasting Korean strawberries. Seoul experience will not be complete without spending time in Myeongdong - for items well worth your money and visit. You also get to wear your sleek winter apparel with single digit temp if not below zero degree centigrade all day long."
Street food and cosmetic shopping paradise !!!,If you like street side food this is paradise for you. The place is full of food and it looks yum . The other speciality of this place appears to be cosmetics shopping and naturals clearly appears to be the latest trend ..There were more than 500 shops all selling cosmetics and giving some excellent deals. Must visit as part of the Seoul itinerary. 
Seoul experience,"At first it seemed a bit overwhelming but after about the 3rd day into our vacation, getting through the crowd and going from store to store became second nature. Lots of food venues and stores. Also you will find lots of beauty stores. Overall a good experience."
Street of mainstream K-skincare brands,"Every major K-skincare brand has a boutique store on this street, in fact more than one. The same brand has at least two stores on the same block, and then you see them again as you keep walking. Laneige, InnisFree, Nature Republic, Holika Holika, Etude House, My Face Shop, they are all here."
Window shopping ,"The mecca of beauty products in Seoul. I suggest coming here just for the experience, but I don’t suggest here to come for shopping. I think it’s too touristy that even sidewalk vendors sell pricey items. If you want to go shopping for cheaper beauty products without getting overwhelmed with the crowd and array of beauty products shop, then you should go to Ewha Womans University. But aside from beauty products which this place is known for, this market is also known for its copious number of Korean streetfood. But mind you, trying all the streetfoods here at this market can actually make a big dent in your pocket because the cheapest food that I saw was 1,000 Won. So be wary as you go indulge yourself on Korean streetfood because you might actually have used up all your money without you knowing."
NIce place to spent your money,Is a must visit place for those ladies who love shopping very much.I went there 3 times in a week.Cosmetic is so so cheap compare to my country.I wish i can bring more back.Street foods is delicious especially eat during winter season.
"Shopping, street food and animals! ","This shopping street/area is huge! There are so many shops off the main street and endless side streets with shop after shop. Some of them are very expensive but you can find good deals and sales and also find some cheap good quality items. I got some pants, dresses and shirts. We also bought several souvenirs for friends and family members. We also went to a dog cafe one day and a cat cafe on another. We had some street food and it was really good. This is a must see shopping area in Seoul. I would definitely recommend going here to do some shopping, grab some delicious street food and maybe grab some drinks and pet some animals (if you are an animal lover like I am!)"
Shopping,"Great shopping district, especially for cosmetic, great bargain and good quality, English speaking wasn't very useful in most of the shops, watched out some restaurants, checked menu price first, socks and toys were cheap but for XL clothes will be impossible, myself unable to find any, not even in Uniquo."
So much shopping on one street...,"If you're looking for shopping, this is the street that I recommend. It had every store that I could think of and more. All in all, prices were alright. There are also currency exchanges in the area which was very handy. "
Great shopping area!,Great shopping area with lots to see and experience. The place has lots of restaurants as well! And ladies can get most if not all the cosmetic brands there.
Shopping paradise ,Anyone who loves to shop should be at Myeongdong. Also there are street food at every corner to satisfy those hungry stomach. 
Shopping heaven and cheap,You can buy cosmetic here and it very cheap. The street food is also so yummy. Try as many food items you can find. 
Shop till you drop,"A must go and see, of course. Lots of shopping, lots to eat, either road side stalls, or restaurants. The choice is unlimited. Could easily spend half a day there, and back the second day!"
Lots of food!,All of the things you know about street food can be found here. The bazaar starts around 4pm till 10pm. It is also a giant shooping center. Everything from Korean products to Americans' can be found. 
Best cosmetic shopping mecca ,Try to split your item into a little bit more than KRW 30000. So you will get instant tax refund and free gift. Than you can move to another store and do the same. Try their snack along the alleys it's delicious
"Shopping for ladies, food for gentlemen!","That's a really great experience - to come in the evening to have a couple of bites of a local food. And to watch locals, who are so different and bright. "
Getting Lost and Finding Treasures,"Myeondong is one of those places, like many in the world, in any city, where the buildings, shops, alleys form a natural myriad of organically developed hustle and bustle of trade, residence and worship. A visitor cannot feel but overwhelmed by the closeness of these alleys which the senses are slathered with music, drooling smells of food, lovely retail assistants in many types of attire to entice you to walk into the shops. Where you have small but well stocked shops on both sides of the alleys and in some broader ones, have another two rows of carts selling everything from BBQ corn to children's socks. The residents who used to live here must have had close intimate relationships because of the proximity of one type of shop, food and service. Of course, there is some gentrification where more retail shops have popped up. Yet you find quaint shops from a Pet Cafe ( yes literally pay for time with different dogs to lie on your lap) to BBQ skewered meats, to strawberries dipped with chocolate, buns covered with pigeon eggs to famous Korean seafood cuisine and fine dining. And mind you, this is what you see at eye level. Most buildings have hidden gems of restaurants and retail in the upper levels. Your sight must rise above the usual man's height and look up, look around, look down to basements to find , explore and enjoy. And Myeondong continues to sparkle throughout the 4 seasons yet it has within this district, connected by major train lines, hotels surrounding it a most famous Catholic Church. When the Pope visited Seoul, this was the church he conduct mass at. Trip Advisor does not have enough space for me to continue with the many woven stories of good food, cute things to buy, fun people to watch. The thing is, one gets immersed into Myeondong ( Literally meaning Bright Cave) and need only emerge out of this district to fly home. Discover your own story."
Enjoy the market,"A very crowded place but good enough to shop some beauty products and snacks! Wow, when you just passed about 10/15 steps of your foot from entrance of the market (from myeongdong subway), theres a guy who sells the eggbuns. And it was the delicious one i have ever eaten. And also the fishcake is a must to try! "
Underground shopping ,"Nice choices, excellent service and high quality goods sold in the underground shops. The shops sell Korea made goods the demand for which is low with tourists. "
"Fashion, Cosmetics, Food Galore!!!","Place to find anything and everything a lady will like, plus tons of food around everywhere. Street food prices are a little steep though, but still taste great nevertheless. Most Street vendors operates during the evening time, morning and noon is usually just shops."
Great Food and Shopping ,"Great place to do shopping and eating lots of delicious food. Living in Hong Kong I thought it would be similarly busy but to my surprise it wasn't at all. There is plenty of place to walk around calmly, browse, eat, all day and night long. "
"walk, eat & shop",best time to visit this place is during night time. Many stores offers low price and lots of freebies during late night or almost closing time. Street foods are also a must try!
Everything in one place,"If you have limited time in Seoul, Myeongdong might be the best bet. Skincare, clothes, sport shoes, street food, café and restaurant all in 1 place. It is not necessary the cheapest but you can get almost all that I mentioned earlier. We stay near Myeongdong which was easy for food since there are a lot of restaurant and street food available. Bought great bargain sport shoes which we wont able to get back home, so that was good trip for us. Bought beautiful and nice accessories, some are more expansive than others, so do look out for those with great bargains. Bought ladies top which usually are free size and no fitting allowed. Typically they are a size M/L or the materials are stretchable, likewise some design are more than $50 which others bargain price so depends on your taste."
Buzzing.,Very busy and buzzing shopping area. Many eating places to choose from and lots of coffee shops. All the top brands and many other shops where you can shop at. Clean and even has smoking huts so people do not smoke in the streets.
Busy and fun!,"Lots of hustle, bustle and fun. Bargains for sure but mostly a good people watching option. Bought bits and pieces. Nothing amazing though. "
Tourist trap,"A lot of shops, mainly skincare. But the salespeople where almost aggressive when they wanted you to come into the shops. Basically it's the exact same shops as everywhere, but more frantic. I seriously don't recommend it for shopping. Choose one of the biggest malls instead."
Control your urge to spend money ,"My wife and I heard a lot about myeongdong, how the shops give away freebies like nothing, how attractive the sales are. We walked alone street away from the main street of myeongdong searching for face mask with heavy discount, and attracted by the discount signs outside one shop. Guess what? We didn't get freebies. The shopkeeper tried to talk us into buying face mask which are more "" premium"". And when I ask if there is tax free since I hit the 30k won, the answer was NO because the items were at discount. We were very disappointed. Where are the freebies that everyone talked about? When we went to Lotte Duty free shop, we saw the same items sold at same price, but can claim the tax. We are disappointed. Next time we will see where the crowd go, and stay in main street of myeongdong."
"Love it! Food, makeup, shopping!! ","A must if you're visiting Seoul! From knock offs and food carts to high end name brand stores, you won't be disappointed!! "
Great Shopping District,So many interesting shops and street food to try! A must buy is the facial masks and Korean cosmetics
It's a place for everything about shopping,"It open at 9 or 8 am. Our guesthouse was just a few steps from this shopping street. So many things that you could shop, from clothes, beauty cosmetics to food. But the food street usually opens in the afternoon until midnight."
Very Nice shopping street,"Very lively , different variety of stores in each street. There's balance - one street are full of eateries , another dresses and dry goods and another street sells diff brand of skincare and another street of variety of Korean souvenirs. Along the main alley a lot of street treats and Korean specialties. Fun place to be for a tourist. "
enjoy walking street food! ,"a great way to snack around and shopping in myeongdong with many free wifi hotspot. however, do shop around for the lowest prices, and find shops with Tax Refund for tourist! Only issue is, it is not quite easy to find restroom around the area. "
"Crowded, hyped-up shopping strip","Was very crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Reminded me of Ximending in Taipei in terms of scale, type of shopping available, food, and crowd.You can find local and foreign brands here, and local snacks and push carts selling cheaper goods and clothes.Can be too crowded to be child/stroller-friendly though."
Lots of animation in the evening under the illumination,Full of animated atmosphere and full of happy mood in the street. Lots of exotic street food in every ally. It is a MUST place to visit.
Heaven for cosmetics and food lovers!,"This place is amazing for people who love to look after their skin, cosmetics are nearly in every shop, feels like you're in heaven as I love make up, recommended for people who loves to look good. Traditional exotic food stalls all over the street, hard to choose they all look delicious and fresh as they are cooked on the spot."
Shopper's paradise,Here shoppers and food addicts will not be disappointed by the vast variety of products and eateries lining its streets and alleys.Special interest is street food at night.Must visit place in Seoul.
Expensive,"Very pushy sales people. Expensive prices compared to outside. Don't be too tempted by the ""freebies"" as they jerk up prices, then give freebies. I saw the exact same items, elsewhere for 20,000KRW and sold here for 30,000KRW "
"Foods,foods,shoping,shoping","Great place to have treats on South Koreans streets food. Mouth watering food with wide variety from fried,grilled,stuffed,soups and the list goes on."
Fun and Safe,"Day or night, the Myeongdong shopping street is a fun place to go. Lots of street food in the evenings and as early as noon on weekends. Really fun and safe. Full of life and positive vibes. Store assistants shout out their offers but no hassling. They even have volunteer tourist guides, dressed in bright red, mingling with the crowd offering assistance in various languages. I consulted with some of them and their information were spot on!There are lots of interesting shops too. What I found interesting is that the currency exchange outlets on the street offer hugely better rates than the money changers at airports in Singapore or Incheon."
Shop and Dine in Korea,"This place is the go to place when you want to shop and dine in Korea. It has all the brands, local and foreign. As Korea is known for its cosmetics, this place is about 50% cosmetics.Besides shopping, there are a lot of food stalls in the middle of the streets where you can eat to your hearts content."
Busy street,Enjoyed shopping at there and there are a lot of street food. Shame that we were too full and could not try all the food. 
Foodie delight,"Lots of great small restaurants and nightly street foods. Good way to try very a lot of different dishes. Vendors are usually younger folks, so very patient and courteous. Don't hesitate to ask"
"Cosmetic shops, good value for money exchange rate, street food","Going on weekends or friday night is exciting that going on weekdays. There are a lot of sellers when you go during weekends. Make sure to canvas prices first before buying as it is a big place to walk around and even has more than 1 shop for a single brand. Canvas exchange rates in different shops as the ones farthest has a good deal and value when you need to have your money changed to Korean won. Some shops doesnt accept credit cards especially stalls so make sure to bring korean won with you.From myeongdong station take EXIT 5 or 6. Streetfood is good here and usually starts at 3,000 korean won."
Highlight of the trip,"You can never miss this street if you are in Seoul.. along with lots of shopping , street food is so yummy .... after six in evening , food stalls will set up and you must relish on the street food sold there.. we stayed right in mid of myeongdong , so we had lots of street food. the place is really happening and you will feel hyped .. "
Vacation,Very interesting how they have there shoppong malls setup on each building the have stores inside stores.
Shopping,There wasn't too much of variety stores. Mainly a lots of cosmetic stores. I liked olive and young where you could get all kinds of beauty related stuff. I did not have my passport with me so they gave me bar coded receipt and I got my tax back at the airport. There were a lot restaurants and street foods late afternoon.
Fun bit crazy and over priced. ,We stayed in this area and were on this street daily. The food stalls are delicious but really over priced. $4 for orange juice $5 for a pastry. The skin care stores that surround the streets are full of over zealous hustlers who will try to sell you everything under the sun and be very demanding about it Found it like a very less classy shinjuku 
Love this place!,"Great for shopping with many kinds of shop from clothes to cosmetics, etc... many great street food for you to try."
A very 'lifely' Shopping -,"In this and the adjacent streets, you will find something for everybody, both in terms of shopping and dining. "
Exciting ,"A heaven of cosmetic Korea. I love here. It's not the first time I come here. But whenever I come, I always find the exciting things. If you can, look for a local friends, you can try soju, tokpoki, maekoli,.. in a small tent together. Not many Koreans speak English but I'm sure they are so friendly.Don't forget to enjoy street food here"
great place for shopping and eating,amazing place on the evening for some fun shopping and great street vendors foodfrom pasta to lobster and some nice chicken sticks its a fun place to have a cheap easy and quite nice diner in Seoul
"very vibrant, live with activities","Sensory overload for people who like quiet places. For people who likes shopping, people gazing and lively place, this is it. Many foreigners are there. Many great restaurants are available as well as cosmetics, clothes, and souvenir shops. Day and night is different. would consider visiting during the day and during the night to see the difference. Few negatives: cars/trucks/motorcycles driving through streets where people walk around so need to watch where you are going. Also, many sales people are around."
Makeup Mecca!!,"This is Korean makeup heaven, guys! Literally makeup shops for miles on end. And for each purchase they give you lots of freebies to try. Although there's a language barrier to a certain degree, the salespersons try their best to communicate even through gestures, haha. Shops are open til late in the evening specially on weekends. I stayed for 6 nights and went to Myeongdong every single night for my shopping fix. :) My happy place in Seoul!"
Fantastic ! ,Had a few hours to kill. Heard about the legendary Korean skin care and face masks which one has to buy as they make great gifts. This area was teaming with shops selling face masks and skin care products. Some shops have In-House VAT refund counters. But what I absolutely loved was the street food ! Tonnes of stalls selling mouth-watering food. Had the best freshly squeezed pomegranate juice. Great way to spend a few hours. 
Worth a visit,"Very nice shops, full of life. Looks like it is always beasy. Restaurants, coffee shops and lots of people in the streets during the weekend"
Good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need,This area is a good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need. It is filed with so many vendors and stores selling anything and everything a tourist and local may want and need. Allow yourself a couple hours here as you can get lost in the alleys that make up this shopping area.
This is a street maze you'd like to visit!,The Myeong Dong shopping streets offering a veriety of trending fashion as well as street food.It has a young atmosphere but elderly people will enjoy it as well.
busy myeongdong,"the very first thing i remember about myeongdong shopping street is the free gift :) when you walk on or walk in a shop some sales promotion girl/boys will gave you free gift (usually a masker or face lotion) at noon this street is full of shop and shopper only so many beauty shop you can find here from etude, face shop, laneige, etc. for fashion there also some known brand like uniqlo, H & M, etc. at night it changes to become centre of street culinary at myeong dong (oh my god!!) this place become so crowded and surrounded by delicious and mouth watering smell of street foodsfor the foodi recommend oden, toppoki, and some satay (pork, beef, chicken and seafood) the best time to go here is from 4 pm until 9 pmi visit here on jan 17 :)"
Shopping and Food tripping at Myeongdong😜,"It has been said that if u are in Korea, one must visit this place for cosmetics and food street. And yes, it was really true and we enjoyed the food too much and bought some Korean cosmetic products. Its quite pricey but worth it coz Korean beauty peoducts is one of the best and effective products for face and body care."
Everything you can think about,Its the place that you can find everything you can think about. It is a place you go to spend money. Dont miss it. 
Buy everything ,"Lot of shop and tourists, you can by everything. But pay attention on your wallet, you can buy street food."
Overwhelming exciting!,"This place is overwhelmingly great! Lots of shopping and eats. If you walk further to the Myeondong theatre there are shows being performed outside. A lot of street vendors selling food, clothes, hats, socks."
Pure fun!,"Come here in the evening, it is a pure fun. Music from all over, hundreds of people roaming, dozens of cosmetic shops on every street are inviting you to come inside. Really strange for Europeans and something you imagine to be really Asian. Really worth a visit right after you arrive to Seoul. "
The 'place to be' in Seoul,"Visited Myeongdong and loved the area so much that we came back to it everyday during my trip to Seoul. The street food is the bomb, particularly the japchae, flame grilled lobsters, and chicken skewers. It has a great nightlife, lots of shopping, restaurants, and a youth culture."
Excellent for skincare products and make-up!,Myeongdong is famous for the immense number of skincare products and make up shops! At almost every street you can find an Etude House or Innisfree shop. The prices are the same as most places elsewhere in Korea but they are relatively cheap compared to most other countries!
"modern face of South Korea, Seoul",one of the place you must visit in Seoul. Full with beauty shop and shopping centers and a lot of street foods which are delicious.
Shopping shopping ,This is haven for shopping junkies and food addict. All put it on your list when going to Seoul. Also prepare your budget ready for bargains!
Scratch beneath the surface,"A very vibrant district of Seoul, seemingly super famed for its shopping and food.Its easy to see why this is the case and when we arrived it was an exciting area to explore and we eagerly anticipated hitting the shops.When we did so I can only describe the experience as disappointing. There is lots of repetition and no standout identity to what was on offer (make up aside of course). "
Great street food,"The shopping in the Myeondong area is great, particularly for skin care products.There are many clothes shops too but the best part is the street food at night.This is definitely somewhere you should visit during your trip to Seoul, and I'd recommend staying in Myeongdong for your stay.Great atmosphere."
One of my favourites in Seoul,"My favourite place to stay in Seoul is around this shopping street in Myeongdong. It's perfect because you can drop all your shopping off to your room, and head down to get something to eat at any time. At night time it's a little more crazy and you'll be shoulder to shoulder with other people but you get used to it. Lots of food to choose from but most of it is the same stuff. Can get a little expensive if you get lots of food. Lots of restaurants around and plenty of stores to shop at, and the staff at the beauty stores can be pushy to get you to come in (one forced me to come in once - I just walked in then out). Goes on until usually around 11pm. Very easy to get to by public transport."
Holidays in Seoul,"Nice place to go for shopping. There are many shops at the basement as well as on the roadside. Many varieties of goods, clothes , facial products & food along the street . Advisable to bring more cash as some vendors don't accept credit card. You can go on shopping without realising that you have spend so much."
Nice Myeongdong Street and surrounding area,"I did not imagine I will enjoy Myeongdong. Such a nice experience esp. for street food lovers! There are lots of restos also, plus beauty products stores."
Overwhealming,"If you go at night, the lights here are similar to what you would experience in downtown Tokyo. Plenty of reasonably priced eateries around. If you can choose again between day or night, for sure go at not."
Best Place For Shopping ,Myeongdong was a great shopping place in Seoul. There were many shops & restaurants on both sides of the street. There were many pushcarts in the middle of the street sellingfood and all kind of items. The street was crowded with people and it's a very vibrant shopping place when compared to elsewhere. A must go place when in Seoul !! Love it ! 
Your average shopping street,"The best bit about it is the street food outside of the shops. The shopping is mostly beauty products, but still worth a visit."
Shopping Paradise,"I managed to find all the K-pop & K-drama actors merchandise and lots of skin care product here. Also it is a walk to the Namsan Tower. For shopaholic, this is your paradise and to find a hotel which is located in the heart of Myeongdong "
Upscale Shopping ,"Unlike the other market streets, this is upper scale shopping and restaurants. Most if the shopping is cosmetics and clothing. Very clean. Some street food. "
Sales could be really pushy,"LikeThey are generous with samples. They will offer you free sample, mostly face mask to have you enter their shop. Lots of eateries stall in the areaConsI dislike that mostly the cosmetic shop sell in bulk. For example, you will have to buy like 2 to 3 bottles instead of 1.And the sales could be really pushy, especially to foreigner. I was pushed to buy a eye cream at one of the shop (The S#e#). The seller told me that the price is 100.000 KRW and buy one get one. Since she was that pushy, I ended buy. But later on, I was pissed when I check on the receipt that it was actually only 50.000 KRW per bottle. So, basically I bought both those so called 'buy one get one'. I paid 100.000 for 2 bottles assuming that I got good deals, which apparently, it was 50.000 each. Stupid me. So, shall you wish to buy there... Don't get to excited with all the buy one get one promotion or others.... "
Full of life and lots and lots of shopping!,This place is amazing for shopping. A great place to visit in the evenings when all the street food stalls are open. There are soo many shops and I got lost numerous times!
Fantastic Shopping!,"Exit 6 of Myeongdong station is the nearest to this shopping haven. We went in early May and they were having sale. We bought more than KRW500,000 of skincare from Sea N Tree. They were having 1 for 1 promotion on their Vit C Capsule Ampoule and Snail Serum which cost KRW45,000 per bottle and KRW39,000 for Hyaluron Ampoule 100ml. We received lots of free samples and 4 boxes of masks free. MCM also offered KRW30,000 off any purchase with registration of a new passport as member. For purchases below KRW300,000, you can get immediate tax refund in the shop. Above that amount, you have to claim from the airport upon departure. You can find Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, Teeny Weenie, Laneige and many other Korean brands here. After 6pm, stalls start sprouting out of nowhere on the streets selling street food. Shops open daily from 11am to 10pm."
Fun for free time,Great street to stroll around when you have some free time. You can buy a lost of reasonably priced items and delicious street food. I don't think anyone should PAY to go on a tour here- just do it yourself.
Lovely place ,"My favourite part of Seoul ^^ full of life <3 lot of restaurants, fashion shops, shops with music products (kpop), also magnificent cathedral :) "
Crowded and noisy,"If you want to get feeling for shopping, you have to go here. Hundreds of shops and street venors. Very interesting!"
Nice Place,"Restaurants and shopping centers has its wide variety of options. Very crowded that you cannot take a good photo alone, especially during Sundays and night time. But overall we enjoy wandering around. Enjoying the different street foods! So good! Next time we come back to Seoul we will absolutely visit this place again."
Shopping and more shopping,"Place for cosmetics and beauty products, cheapest place for beauty products as compared to namdaemun and dongdaemum. Place is filled with food stalls and restaurants and is extremely safe. Shopping for clothes is fine too. In short, higher end shopping at dongdaemun and lower end whole sale clothing at namdaemun."
The Heart and Soul .... of SEOUL !,"This is the shopping and youth capital of Korea. You can buy just about anything here - food, kit, makeup, every brand name under the sun. You name it, its here. You can get lots of cheap stuff here also, and girls - this is a COSMETICS PARADISE !! You can be young, wild and free here. There is something here for pretty much everyone."
Finally get to walk on this famous street,"Bring enough money or be disciplined not to spend at all the street food is not that affordable but I guess this is meant for tourists anyway. It all start from 3000 krw and a skewer of sausages cost 4000 krw or SGD5. There were plenty of cosmetic products and sales persons were aggressive. They could come close to you, handed you some samples and attempt to pull you in to the shop for shopping. So just shake your head if you're not interested. I'm pretty good at that towards the end of my first night "
Soooo much fun!!,This is one of my favorite thing we did on this trip to Seoul...the streets you can literally get lost in!!! Sooo much to eat and see and shop!! You need to do this!!! Koreans are excellent people very kind.
Full of Night Life,"The streets at night are full of people shopping, eating and simply strolling, Great street food which all looks tasty all be it mostly deep fried, but clean, "
Its not your imagination there are multiple shops of the same brand,"Great place to get lost and wonder if you have been there or not. There are multiple shops in each alleyways of the same brand so If you didn't buy what you wanted in the other shop, rest easy your chance to buy it will come up in the next alleyway. Oh and samples are great, they will give it to you as long as you go in the shop, but be strong they are really good at selling, otherwise you'll end up buying 200 piece of face mask (while in korea get their beauty products). If you get hungry the street stalls is great place to snack. try the dragon beard candy and if you can their KFC (korean fried chicken) it's to die for!!!"
Great Shopping and People Watching,Lots of shoes and clothingstores. Very close to an abundance of street food in the afternoon/evening. Seemed to be busy day and night.
Crowds and makeup ,"Myeongdong is great for buying makeup as there are literally hundreds of makeup stores. The street food is overpriced compared to other areas but still good. It gets very busy later in the day. Shop assistants will stand infront of their store handing out beauty face masks, but only take it if you actually want to go inside their shop and buy something. If you walk in and don't buy anything they will take the mask back from you. It's like a ticket to see their products. One visit to Myeongdong is enough if you're not into shopping for beauty products."
Wow,What a shopping experience.In terms of the array and diversity truly amazing.Local food offerings looked most interesting too.
nice shopping street with great food,The street is fully of food carts in the evening. Selling Korea traditional dim sum and also popular street food. 
Place to go if you have little time to shop ,"A very convenient place to go shopping and eating if you have only little time to stay at Seoul. You can find almost every cosmetic brands here and the staff are all friendly. They are experienced and speak fluent Mandarin and English, a lot of small gifts will be given along with your bought items. Clothes and accessories sold here are trendy. Many Korean restaurants and cafe and you can rest whenever tired. One point to mention is wifi is extremely convenient because almost all cafe provide free wifi service which is very caring to tourists. "
Shopping Block - Buy those cosmetics!,"Very busy block of shopping center which sale alot of cosmetics, foods and full of pub/bar at night. You named it, Face shop, Etude house, Innisfree, nature republic, skin 79, skin foods. The price can be 50% cheaper than what your country offer you. "
"Busy, loud, sensory overload ... but FUN!","We stayed in the Pacific Hotel, which is just across the street. After Dinner we made it our daily routine to stroll around the streets of Myeongdong. It's a real fun area, ok in daytime, but much better in the evening / at night. It is quite a compact area with a good number of side streets. Even in size it is not huge, we always discovered a shop we haven't seen yet...or even a whole lane we didn't walk yet.The streets are full with street vendors selling food, clothes, cheap jewelry and lots more. A good spot to stock up on your socks. The street food here is not that cheap, but good in quality. Besides the street food there are countless restaurants, many hiding in upper floors without english signs. And of course a huge array of stores. Mostly fashion, clothing and beauty products. If you are not interested in the latest trend of beauty masks, just avoid eye contact with the guys and girls trying to give you a free sample.In the evening the streets are packed. Full with people, lots of tourists, but also lots of Koreans. It's bright, it's loud....but it has charm, we loved it and couldn't get enough of it.Be aware that most shops and food stalls close around 10.30 - 11.00pm. Also many restaurants do not open longer than 10pm.Some restaurants I recommend:Myeongdong Jungil Hoegwan - just across the main street, next to the Pacific Hotel; good Korean BBQ (there are two similar restaurants next to each other....choose the one on the right)Kyoja - Dumplings, Gyoza and Noodle Soup; cheap and cheerful, great flavoursJogaewa Seafood Bar & Restaurant - great grilled seafood; easy to spot with the electric clam above the entraceAll in all not to be missed. We did prefer this area to Insadong, which was a bit too artsy for our taste (good restaurants though). If you do not have much time in Seoul, this should be on top of your list.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
touristic area of seoul,a bit too touristic with repetition of cosmetic shops. Recommend if you only have few days' time in Seoul. Recommend other commercial area if you stay for more days.
Favorite shopping area,"Myeong dong is so cool! Cat cafes, street food paradise, shopping both cheap & upscale. We loved it so much we went back a second time in a week."
Shopping and Eating!,"Enjoyed Myeongdong, no matter how crowded it was! The spiral potato on a stick tasted like fresh potato chips, we opted for plain salt over dipping on cheese or onion powder. We didn't try the other street foods but went to seafood and bbq restaurants instead. "
Great shopping and Korean Street Foods,"We visited Myeongdong twice. Once in the afteroon and once in the evening. We had lunch, dinner and street foods in between. The Korean BBQ lunch was ok, the dinner with Korean Tofu soup and stew pork was great and the street foods were even greater with variety and creativity.There were a lot of band name shops with good prices as well. Highly recommended."
A labyrinth full of surprises,"Been there many times and got lost every single times! what seems like a square is actually a labyrinth with multiple junctions, hidden treasures, vibrant energy and amazing street food! Primary aim to visit Myeongdong village is hunt for cosmetics and there are plenty plenty plenty!!! Despite this need, street food is umbelievable! from fresh juice stands (pomegranate juice recommended), fried delicacies, spatial ice creams and many more, great seafoos, noodles, korean barbecue joints are to be found! Bottom line is as soon as you step in you will be teleported in one of the most dynamic experience of your life! Garanteed (except if you don't feel confortable in the crowd):)"
Happening place for shopping cosmetics and eating,"The minute you exit from exit 6 from the Seoul metro you see rows of street food it is such a huge place selling all different kinds of Korean cosmetics such a wide variety of choices,many branches of Nature Republic,Tony Moly,Etude House,Skinfood,etc etc. If you purchase something they give you lots of free samples like face masks,skin lotions,emulsions,toners.There are also shops selling the latest in Korean fashions which are very pretty usually in pastel colours. It is not so cheap compared to the street stalls which are cheaper.There are also many good Korean restaurants here.We had Korean BBQ which was so good.Myeondong is usually crowded especially weekends and in the evenings."
Shop and eat,It is a shopping huge area with lots of streat food.I used to go there in the evening after sightseeing.You can do shopping and taste foodIt is safe and you find cafes as well 
Shopper's paradise ,"This is a must visit for shopaholics. You can find literally every thing from almost every brand, be it luxury or local. You cannot finish strolling all the streets in just ine day. I have been there for several times and every time I discovered something new. Even if you don't love shopping, you have to go there for the wide array of street foods it has to offer. You can also find some halal street foods there. Honey garlic shrimp and barbecue chicken has been my favourites. These shops are usually open till late so I suggest visiting at night. This place has something for everyone."
Hot spot for cosmetic lovers ,"If you don't know what to choose from hundreds of different korean cosmetic brands, myeongdong is the best choice to come. Why? Because all brand clustered together in this one area. They also usually have different promotion than stores outside myeongdong. If you're hungry, you can go to the famous myeongdong gyoza to have some noodles and dumplings. Or for K-pop lovers, you can go to YG republique for some BBQ. The restaurant is privately own by YG entertainment. You can ezpext to see handsome servers there"
Good eats,"Good variety of street food and shops. You can find things like mochi stuffed with red bean and fresh strawberry, fried prawns, baked lobster, egg bread, fish cakes, many things on skewers, and ice cream. It's crowded but manageable."
Beauty Products,"An entire area dedicated to beauty products, with all the major beauty brands located here (innisfree, nature republic, skinfood, face shop, balina co., etc). This is the place to buy all your facial products and makeup. There is a Line theme shop in here too that is a must-go place for absolute cuteness.Food and clothing stalls are set up at the centre of the street every night. Food is pretty overpriced but they offer a good variety.This is also the place for good food if you know how to find it. There is a famous dumpling shop here and there are great bbq and seafood places hiding in the lanes."
Shopping at its best,We went here and since its a weekend its a bit crowded. Good thing the deals from the stores are worth for grabbing especially the cosmetics.
A must in Seoul,"It's a wonderful shopping area with lots of shops selling fashion and cosmetics. There are restaurants, both indoor and outdoor, every here and there. Stalls are along the streets starting from late afternoon to late at night, selling wonderful snacks mostly. You can also find very good quality strawberries at very affordable prices. "
Good Street Food,Myeongdong Street Food is the best i have tasted in Asia. They even have cheese baked live scallop and lobster! The promegenate juice is delicious and healthy too!
Great food and shopping ,Go after 4pm and be hungry. Great choices for food and fun environment. Plenty of places to shop for mainstream and tourist stuff. Went back multiple times. 
Food food food!!! ,Went to this food street on our first night in Seoul! There were so many food choices. From salty to sweet myeongdong street will not disappoint. Fairly priced you can find many snacks to munch on as you explore. 
Lots of food,Great selection of street food. Reasonable prices. Some of the street vendors move from day to day so may look different the next day.
A fun food and street market,"The first street market I've ever seen that is set in the middle of high end shopping stores. But also the best street food I've ever had, and I'm a picky eater. They sell lobster, scallops(cooked with a blow torch!), steaks, chocolate covered strawberries, honey ice cream stuffed into a fish shaped pastry, the famous 32 cm high ice cream cones, fresh squeezed juices. The stalls go on for block after block in all directions. You can also get lots of souvenirs. I bought a nice souvenir t-shirt for only $6. Lots of restaurants, skin care shops, massages. We went here 3 times and had a blast every time."
Just another touristy shopping street,"Pricey street food, cheaper food elsewhere. Shopping is good as many streets and shops available. Beware of taking free masks as price is being pulled into shops for sales talk to buy more masks! "
Meongdong,"This is good for shopping and dining , but too crowded bec of the street food lining up the center of the main street! If only this could be placed on another street, will be less crowded, and much cleaner. The mask and skin care shops are too much like one brand can be seen every 500 meter walk; the store sellers speak good mandarin but poor english sad to say. "
Great place for shopping & food,There are so many brands of skin care and cosmetic products that you will be spoilt for choice. It's also a great place for food like the famous Korean fried chicken and BBQ meals.
Korea adventure ,"I love this place! Myeongdong is the fashion capital of Korea. If only I have enough space in my luggage I would have loved to do more shopping in this area. You can buy everything in myeongdong, from clothes to accessories to skin care and so on and so forth. It's simply amazing! "
Brand names and logos rule,"I really didn't see the ""so called bargains"" people spoke of. You either had over priced designer labels being purchased by people who were more concerned about the label than the quality or cheap stuff being sold in stalls that will fall apart after ne use. The primary shops are for skin creams and cosmetics. "
Shopping galore,A lot of information from all different directions. Shop all you want and eat street food as well. Prices can be quite expensive since its an obvious tourist trap but convenience is definitely there. 
Worth to visit but price will be cheaper elsewhere,Good time to kill time as a lot of things to buy though more expensive than other places.Have a lot of different food/snacks and also good place to exchange your monies at great exchange rate (can negotiate as well). 
Great range of shops,"Range of shops is the most interesting out of all the shopping areas. However, street food is more expensive. So for items that are pretty common, such as the egg bread and rice cakes, it's better to buy them at other areas like Hongdae instead where it's 500 won cheaper. However, Myeongdong offers other street food that other areas do not have to cater to tourists, such as seafood. And not forgetting, there's an innisfree / skinfood / nature republic / faceshop almost every corner you turn, so it's a great one-stop place to get all your beauty products."
Senior Deputy clerk,"This is a fantastic place. Endless shopping stores. We are on our 5th day and still many more shops to visit. No problem with not understanding the language a lot of local speak and understand English. A variety of everything you can imagine to shop for. Our Hotel 28 is in the very center of all the shopping stores. Jin, Jessi are excellent staff at Hotel 28 - Very helpful with providing directions and room service. Adien from Hotel 28 recommended lots of other attractions to tour as well. You also will not be hungry lots of food carts. An amazing place to tour and have your feel of the culture and the locals. The boutique shops are decorated very well and are inviting. Your feet walks right into the boutique without you realizing. Totally recommend the Myeongdong shopping street.Toni C."
Street food! ,"Went there twice in my 3 days there. Lots of street food, toiletries, small local restaurants and shopping."
Great shopping ,"Great for people watching as well as shopping! Lots of quaint tea houses and coffee shops! Many art galleries and street food vendors as well! Popular with young and old, families and singles! A must do while visiting Seoul!"
So much fun to do,Great to go around and just get lost in the midst of the vendors and tourists.Don't come too late though as Koreans are early birds so when we arrive here at 20:00 most of the vendors are already getting ready to close.
Vibrant exposure,"The travelled date was actually end March/ early April 2016. I was in Seoul for 12 days and stayed in Myeongdong area because it was convenient for transport to sightsee. The hotel I stayed in was only 10 minute walk from Myeongdeong street area where the real buzz starts from 5.00 pm till late. Bargains galore for quick souvenirs.....scarves, caps, pins/brooches, ........I love the socks, at AUD 1.00 per pair, great for souvenirs and they're quite good quality ( popular among locals too). Because this area is closed to traffic, many shops operate during the day too. Every other shop sells Korean beauty products. Clothing wise....don't bother if you're above size 12 ( I think that's Euro size 36 ??).However, it's the street stalls which draw the crowds. Grilled, fried, baked.....from ever favourite octopus/squids, pancakes, rice cakes in hot sauce ( I love the cheese ones) , sticks of fish cakes, etc. They're not as cheap as you think but prepare to pay around Aud 5 a 10 for any single serve. The large scallop, cooked in shell with toppings of corn, cheese...was imo most expensive at nearly AUD15. It was strawberry season and they're sweeter than sweet....must try (I ate about 2kgs over the entire stay). Boxes of dried peaches/persimmons were a little too marked up in price. Plenty of other outlets serving Korean, Japanese and some western. Money changers are aplenty here."
Better markets in Seoul,"Myeongdong is a busy but not so great shopping area in Seoul. Most of the shops are high end cosmetics shops and the rest are typical mall-type stores. There is street food, yes, but there is street food everywhere in Seoul and is better elsewhere. Check out Insadong, Bukchon Hanok, Dongdaemon, or the Hongik University area if you want to shop and eat among the crowds. Myeongdong, to me, feels more like a tourist invention."
Traditional shopping ,This area has a lot of gift shops and great selection of street food. Lots of things that catch young children's attention.
A great experience especially at night,With so much going on this is certainly an attack on the senses! Shopping and ratting galore! I even found a cat cafe here! 
street market ,"it was a nice street , nice cafe, nice market, every things was beautiful..don't miss visit this street..i love seoul"
Love love Myeongdong 💘,"A place with ambience and so many great choices for food whether it's morning or night. Great place to get the best rates for exchanging currency. Beauty products, clothes, street food, desserts, street entertainment and to get a feel of seoul! "
Love it,"I just love this street. It is full of life and everything you need and don't need. This trip was my 6th time to Korea and my second time to this street. First time was 7 years ago. Not that much have changed however I remember mostly the cosmetic shops from back then and that my suitcase was full off free samples from all the cosmetic shops that they give you when you enter and they let you keep it even if you don't buy anything. This time I felt there were clothes stores and everything of the latest fashion. I went in the morning and the streets were not so crowded as I had expected so that was nice. I was also impressed by seeing a 24 hour adidas shops. A real gem is a shop called Å. I forgot the full name but it has 4 floors with different things like clothes, bags, shoes and accessories. And even one vintage floor. Just love this shop and was glad to find it again. Myeongdong can easily be reached by subway. From there I used goodly map and walked to insadong. It was not far."
Shopping spot with so many street food,"In our last day in seoul, we visited this shopping area. This place famous for shopping, cafe and street food.We arrived at 5.30, intended to shop till you drop :) but my stomach wasn't so cooperative. After a few meter from the subway station, we met some food street outstretched the road. They sell traditional to modern food, from bbq to dessert with reasonable price.After happy tummy, we stroll along the area. In every 50 meter we found cosmetic store with a lot of brand. Korea is famous for that. You name it, they have it. Etude, faceshop, belif etc.If you want to see the nanta show, they have a theater there.But if you want to search for fashion, i suggest better shopping in hongik (young fashion) or dongdaemun market.This street open till pass midnite."
Get ready for the same stores everywhere!,"Unless you've been living under a rock, get ready for the same standard department stores/fast fashion store, and numerous beauty products stores around every corner, in between corners, and the same exact three on the next corner!It was fun to eat the street food (fresh Promogranite juice, so many different sweets, etc , and try out some of the cafes (Hello Kitty, Cat Cafe, etc). But, most of the department stores can be seen anywhere, and the beauty shop prices are very similar to most places in town. We got slightly better deals at innisfree, faceshop, etc at dongdaemun square"
Favorite Place to Shop,"You can find everything here at Meyongdong! From the latest fashion clothes, cosmetics, contact lens and international brand like Nike and Adidas. And don't forget to have some Korea famous street food while walking around the area! "
"Repetitive shops, highly crowded area","What to see:-make up and skincare products (some have 2 branches in the same area)-street food (most start early evening)- restaurants and coffee shops (mostly on the higher floors)-hotels in the area (but would you really like to stay in a crowded area?)-clothes, coats, jackets which are slightly expensive than the ones in Ewha Women's Fashion Street-tourists (like me. Hahaha!)"
Popular street,"It's a very popular with street food,and kosmetik store.It's not open 24 hour.when i go there,there start to close at 10.00pm"
Just ok ..,We have been to better market in terms of choices as well as bargaining with the vendors compared to this place. My personal view is that it was just average. Literally average!
Great for shopping and street food,"This is the place to visit if you're after Korean beauty and skincare. Definitely walk around a bit first before committing to buying in the first store you see as there's at least 3-4 of the same shop in that area. If you can't find a certain LE item in one place, go to another as you might find it there. There's also tons of other retail stores, plus it's worth exploring the little side streets as there's heaps of big brand knock-offs and fakes that are decent quality and inexpensive. My favourite store was the stationery brand Jetoy's Choo Choo cat. If you're into cats, you're going to love this store! The designs are amazing, and there's so much stationery and other adorable things to choose from! The street food vendors start popping up closer to late afternoon, just before evening if that's what you're interested in doing."
Heaven ,"Myeongdong is shopping heaven, either for the street food or skincare.. almost every night we had myeongdong streed food for dinner... variety of Halal food can be found such as egg bun, octopus, lobster, oemok or fish cake and daebokki to name a few... other vendor are selling souvenirs, t-shirt, bag to name a few... for the skin care... just name it all u can find here at myeongdong... they will gv free gift such as mask or sample size of product to allure u to enter their shop...just take the free gift n stroll along their shop, even u dont buy anything u can take the free gift... and if u buy they will give u more free gift... "
Amazing!,"We stayed at Hotel Shin Shin which was a 10 minute walk from the Myeongdong Shopping Street. We frequently visited the Myeongdong markets, which came alive at night time with the many food trucks. There's a lot of food to choose from and the shops were good too. "
Best place to shop!,Had to admit we kept coming back here to shop. Really nice place to shop till you drop. Definitely a must go if you want to do a lot of shopping. You can also buy delicious delicacies at the stalls along the shopping street when you are hungry. There are also halal food around. 
Shop til you drop...,We spent an afternoon here mainly for my wife. The place focuses mainly on skincare and makeup products but if you from a western country - you will find that it's probably cheaper to buy foreign brands at home than here. It's probably better value to get Korean brands that are both cheaper and not available in your country.Lately the crowds here have thinned due to Chinese sanctions on tour groups but its still fairly huddle and bussle.There are many street food carts lining the streets. The variety is good but prices are much higher than in the markets nearby (nandamen)Most stores you just need to buy 30k won and you will get immediate tax refund. Save the hassle at the airport!
Nothing Special,"First time there. However, nothing special. Is the same like in any country. Selling lots of local delicacies. Clothing is more expensive than those selling in any outlets."
Good to visit,Myeongdong is a very nice place to visit however there are not many things to buy. A visit is enough.
Perfect for shopping and eating,"Myeongdong street is your go-to place if you want to try their street food and if you wanna go shopping. There are a lot of stores that you can visit and buy stuff. Further, there are different restaurants you can indulge yourself with Korean food. As for me, this is my fave spot. You can encounter different nationality in this place."
Just Perfect!,"Its an every Woman's dream to be in one place for all their beauty, skin care and the what not. This place is like heaven on earth for Women. For the street food fanatics this street also will not disappoint. It has everything in one single place, its like a complete package."
Shopping and eating!,Myeongdong shopping street was a great place to spend a couple of hours to taste Korean street food and do some light shopping. The streets are very clean and a ton options on food. If your not into street food there are even more restaurants to choose from.
Shopping wonderland,"This place is known for their cosmetic shopping! Many options and duplicate vendors all over. Just make sure you bring your passport or a copy of it so you could get a Tax Refund Receipt at the airport. Try out their cat cafe too, the fuzzy creatures are adorable."
Heaven on earth - Myeongdong shopping street,Many many cosmetic stores which offer best price. Best products. And best brands. Heaven on earth for ladies.. prepare your wallet.. 
Shopping heaven for women,"Yes, it is a place to shop till you drop. Well, if you have much money then you can try shopping in Myeongdong. There are cosmetics, clothes, and others you can buy. Because there are so many cosmetics stores, then they offer various discounts for their products. Too bad, I do not wear cosmetics, so I am not interested in them."
The most touristic in Seoul,"It is across the street from our hotel, i loved it and visited nearly every day special at evening. Lots of shops cloths and lots lots of skin care shops i think all the Korean cosmetics brands have more than branch there. At 10:00 pm most shops close but the street food start from afternoon till after 12:00 am different kind of food snack seafood dessert and juices. Really It fun experience and it is must for anyone visiting Seoul. "
Best place to shop in Seoul,"We visit few recommended shopping areas and found Myeongdong to be it for us. It is a bit more expensive but it has a lot more shop and offer wider range. Having said that if you expect cheap it, this is not the place. Here you can shop till you dropped and that is what we did for few nights."
Make up Haven,The best place to get big big big discounts on all Korean beauty products!!! A true must visit especially for ladies and make up enthusiasts. They give away free samples too!
Massive shopping...,"...yet nothing I really wanted to buy. I was told ""if it's not in Myeongdong, it's not in Korea"". It gets a bit repetitive tending towards boring if you don't want to buy bags, hats, womens clothing or jewelery"
My fav !,You can find so many korean cosmetics stores here and actually korean food streets !! Soooo deliciousss !!But when in adidas store I can't found NMD shoes :(( thats happening now right ?!
the best makeup area,"i stay at seoul for 11days and i went there for 6times its heaven for makeup lovers. There are halal food. kebabs, bun & nutella crepe. "
Looked like a food street more than a shopping street,"Myeongdong was actually the most favourite shopping street of our family in Seoul! There was a lot of nice shops and restaurants around the area. The whole area, also, turned into vibrant and lively at night with hundreds of food stalls along the streets, so it might be looked like a food street rather than a shopping one."
Paradise ,I have never seen such a busy place ever. There are streets of shopping and crowds everywhere. There's restaurants and a variety of local and international brands of cosmetics and clothes . Many many skin care products to be found here. Shoppers paradise.
MyeongDong,The snacks in food stall are great though it is a bit expensive when compared to other places in Korea as being told by my friend. A place for shopping especially when you would like to have a walk on all the cosmetic shop of Korea! However you have to prepare there are many same brand shops. It may be a bored place for male travellers and boyfriends.I believe there are many restaurants with delicious food but too many people so I could not have a look on most of them. You could put this place at night and the last activity as many shops here closed late
I absolutely love this place!!,"I was only here a short time, what a pity!! It has amazing restaurants, stores, and shops. I didn't get to visit any, but I did try the street food and ohhh it was amazing!! Also, i went to the underground shopping area and I barely had time to stop by a huge kpop store where the CDs were cheaper than I had ever seen before while staying in chuncheon or in America. I am definitely going to explore this area more when I come back. I did visit the Myeongdong in Chuncheon so i imagine it is similar and I seriously love that Myeongdong!!"
Craziness!,"I loved this area! Lots of shops (many cosmetics shops), street Food and action. The Place to be in the evening in Seoul!"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Shopping district perfect for make up addicts and bargain hunters! You'll find a 5 story Uniqlo across the Pacific Hotel. Lots of shoe stores, ice cream trucks and food trucks. For bargain hunters there are many stalls selling different bargain items such as clothes, gadgets, souvenir items and much more. Vanity items are everywhere, coffee shops are all around too and when you feel hungry there are different restaurants from Korean to American and even Japanese food. "
The place for skincare products!,"Shops after shops of skincare products! We could also shop for other stuff such as apparel and souvenir too. A wide array of restaurants and cafes around each corner. In the evening the street transforms into a night market with lots of street food and stalls selling socks, bags, etc. "
Cheap buys,"Loved this shopping street. All sorts of things is here. Skin care, bags, shoes, dress. Everything! And its cheap too. ❤️"
Great for Tourist - Lots of Street Food,"What is good in this place is that beginning after lunch, the street becomes a pedestrian street which plenty of food stalls set ups. Great Street food!!! Good place to do window shop."
Shop Watching,"We wandered down this shopping area on our way back from Easter Mass @ The Cathedral on Easter Sunday Morning.Lots of little shops,bars,cafes & small service entities adorn Myeongdong Shopping Street.Sadly there were very few sales on,making a lot of goods quite expensive even by our standards in Australia.Myeongdong has its own Metro Station & is an enjoyable place to go shop watching & leave your purse/wallet in your pocket or purse.Interesting place,albeit would not go there by choice "
Oxford street of South Korea,This place is really hectic at all times of the day.Great for buying beauty products and has some nice restaurants near by.
Iconic street,"We stayed in Myeongdong area. It's a crowded and vibrant area, restaurants and street food cater to different needs, however, it does have a 'go-to-rest' time. Most shops, restaurants and all street food carts will closed for the day around 10-11pm. Most staff in shops and waitresses in restaurants can speak Mandarin & English. Expect street food to be tourist price. "
Discovery walks,"This was across the street from our hotel. We had so much fun trying the food. You could get lost around the streets but its easy to navigate. And in anycase, you can do a lot of people watching and make up shopping while waiting"
Quintessential tourist stop,Great place to sample local korean snacks although not super cheap street food prices. Pretty good vibes in the evening with the tourist & local crowds. 
Shopping Street in the old part of Seoul,"It is a busy shopping street for tourists and locals. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, and at night time there is also street food available."
The place to go for all comestics stuff... some street vendors were quite rude though.,"We drop by this place 3 times in our trip mainly because it opens til later at night. Surprisingly... not beyond 9pm... as vendors and shops start to close their businesses. Crowded and can be overwhelming at times, and some vendors can be rather rude. Overall, still a must visit place when you are in Seoul."
The crowd!!,"It's rarely quiet in this famous street. Cosmetics lovers, fashion, shoes, to bags and everything in between will love this shopping paradise as it offers so many varieties, brands, and style. And those foodies also will enjoy the delicasies. The trends could be changing from time to time but you'll be sured to have fun and getting the tummy filled. During our visit, cheese lobster, scallop, prawns, chickens, candies, crepes are a huge thing. Around 7 yeard ago it's more like fear factor with crickets, worms, and all those critters. cosmetics wise, Korean brand are on the rise, their lipsticks are pigmented, their skincare has wide variety and they are creating their own line that are leading. Walking in this street could be challenging with the crowds and sellers offering people to buy or go to the stores, so embrace yourself. Carry only what's needed and always pays attention. We never experience crime like pickpockets or stuff like that but still, do be careful. Do visit the place around night as the food stalls comes by during that time. Or if you only wants to shops, day time is best as the streets is not yet flooded with those delicious stalls. "
Shopping Mecca,"Best place if you wanna hurdle for BB creams and other cosmetics! Plus, it has a gamut of food choices, international brands, street food, and anything you could ever wanna find in a shopping street,"
Lots of fun.,We spent hours strolling around the quaint little streets filled with lots of interesting people. Worth a visit.
Nice perestrian area,"Alot of shops, restaurants and street food. Most of the street food quite pricey, though. Very crowded. Quite a few cars coming to the pedestrian areas, very annoying."
Shop and eat!,"one of the interesting shopping places in Seoul.. Cosmetics being the highlight.. lot of street food, clean , loud but fun to walk.."
Best place in Seoul!,"All you need is here!!!!! Food, masks, massage, fashion stuffs. It's a total heaven but your wallets might suffer as there's too much temptations around. There's lots of legit massage parlours around (all located at 3/4th floors above the shops) with really good service too! A foot massage costs about 18,000 wons for 40minutes. Highly recommended to relieve your muscles. "
Always Something there to Buy,"We love shopping @ Myeongdong Street. The place is always alive. Very accessible and cheap. So many shoppers in and out of stores. And food stalls and carts lined up the street so you'll never get hungry. There are a lot of stuff to buy specially cosmetics at discounted prices. And there are always freebies given away.Every time we go to Seoul, we make sure to allot 1 day of shopping in Myeongdong."
Less Than Anticipated,Not much variety in shops. Mostly cater to skin and hair care and personal grooming products. Crowded with tourists. 
Shopping!,"Busy but fun place to check out and pick up some required Korean beauty products! And of course, check out the street food -- lobster, scallops, juices, yum!"
Shop Till U Drop... Then Eat.... Shopping Continue,"So many facial shop here.... Value for money.Of course with others too...Many eating place with wide choices.Street Foods start @ 4pm till 10 pm (Just a bit on the high side the price).Wow, can see mostly tourist from all countries.When in Korea, must visit here"
cosmetic heaven,"Myeongdong offers you everything!!! Delicious street food, super cheap quality cosmetic product, fine korean restaurant, trendy fashion store, to foot massages when you fell your foot is killing you but you still need those pairs of eye mask. Came here 3 times in my 6 days visit to south korea but havent managed to explore all areas and still hugely want to come back. Do ask for a tax return form because it was surprisingly easy to process my tax return at the airport. "
window shopping,"wasn't able to look around , everything lack of time & our korean friends have hard time parking and we can't let them wait so long coz they don't like shopping"
Shopping at its best,We went at this area weekend so it was a bit crowded with all the shoppers looking and buying assorted goods from cosmetics to other available stuff on the street.
Vast amount of shopping and street food,"The street has many many many ... shops (most of them ""make up"") you can find a lot of people around and shopping with good variety of restaurants and cafes. La calle tiene muchiiiiiisimas tiendas (la mayoría de maquillaje) puedes encontrar una zona con mucha gente y gran cantidad de opciones para comer y tomar café. "
Shop and Dine,"Tourist spot for Korean cosmetics and apparels. Nothing to worry about if you're tired from walking, hopping from one store to another as food stalls are everywhere at the middle of the road. Restaurants and fine dining are also abound. I always come back here for the Dakgalbi rice at Yoogane; great way to restore your energy after walking around the streets of Myeongdong. You can also choose to relax at Lotte mall and even watch a movie if you want to; they play english movies too!"
Shop till you drop ,This is the place you need to go to buy cosmetics and beauty products. It has the best brand of cosmetics. There's also good street food.
Beauty Products Haven,Myeongdong is a place not to miss. You can get everything and anything you need. Korean cosmetics brand easily accessible in just one street/area. From high end Korean cosmetics to pocket friendly ones. Things you need before buying is more arm power and deeper pockets. 
Shop shop shop ,"A famous area full of shops and restaurants. Nice to roam around. Most shops are cosmetics though that are all the same with different brands. At night, more food and stuff stalls are added on the street that made the area livelier. One visit is enough to explore this area. Subway stations are Myeongdong and Euljiro 1."
Crazy busy but fun! ,"This is the area if you want to shop till you drop. I was looking for gift ideas for all my family members and manage to get them all something. Lots of small gift shops, plenty of different food items, coffee shops, etc in this area. The crowds are plentiful but you can manage to get around. "
Local Eatery & Convenient,"It is great seeing typical localised shops with their localised merchandise, its even better when the money-changer exchange rate is higher than SG.Lots of buses that leads to places like Namsan Park, Palace and Square. Some parts of the streets are lined with white cherry blossom; its gorgeous and within reach from the bus-ride."
"Eat, Shop, Walk and Explore","Our hotel was right here and there were rarely any dull moments. From the shops, the food carts that are out as soon as the afternoon to late at night, the droves of people and the whole culture in itself is an experience. Try to book a hotel in the area, you wont be disappointed."
Happening and good to shop,"We stayed at Jhill Hotel just in front of the Main Street of Myeongdong.Everyone knows that this is a shopping street, and there are lots of food hawkers around.Once you arrive myeongdong, the first thing u should do is find the information center or the person who wearing red hat and red clothes standing in the middle of the street to get a myeongdong map! (You will feel easy to and manage to plan which direction to first and next).Here got lots of women's things, like clothes, accessory, cosmetic and facial shop.This is the third time I visit myeongdong, there is one thing difference if compare to last visited, the hawkers now not willing to bargain(not even one cent), I don't know what happen to them. Seems they earn a lot and doesn't bother. But still some will discount abit, for those who not willing to bargain we will just skip them. Everyone do know those hawker mark up margin for sure over 100%, and they have not willing to give us just little discount.For dinner, we are having Korean style all you can eat! Very cheap, you should look around the sign board, once you visit there you should try their BBQ all you can eat.(I'm sorry to Muslim friends, for those all you can eat restaurant, they do serve pork, Because the cost for pork more cheaper than beef)My sister do like their grill cheese and rice cake(food hawker), you should try it when u see it, and they also have fresh juice blended on the spot(strawberry) and so on, make sure you bring enough Korean Won to enjoy their local food. ^^The local fast food named: Mom's Touch is so delicious if compare to our home country KFC fast food. You can have cheese onion flavour or curry spicy flavour friend chicken(yummy).Myeongdong street connected with two subway station, Eurolji1ga station and Myeongdong station, its very convenience to come or go to other places.Wish you enjoy your holidays in Seoul."
beauty stuff galore,"there are several pedestrianised streets and alleyways selling all sorts of beauty products. some of the smaller ones will have their staff give away product samples (mostly face mask) to entice you to look around inside their store. take note that the more popular ones (innisfree, laneige, etc) do not give free samples. "
Korean pop culture,"This is the ultimate place to be for shopping, dining and just immersing to the Korean pop culture. It tends to be very crowded at night especially on Friday nights. "
Fun experience!,"Beauty shops galore! This is a fun experience while in Seoul, just walking around and seeing the madness of shops (mostly beauty/skincare). If you want to buy stuff make sure you do a bit of research beforehand and most sales people don't speak any English and all the packaging is in Korean! I enjoyed banila and co, tonymoly, and nature republic. Have fun! "
Shopping Heaven for the ladies.,Most amazing shopping place ever. It's not a joke when they said you can lost your way here. Place is big with many cafes and cosmetic shops.Remarks - Bring a leash for your girlfriend. 
Busy shopping area,"Myeongdong is very packed with people. It is the place to look for Korean skincare and cosmetic products. Shop assistants will always try to lure you into their shops by giving away free sheet masks. This is also the place to buy the famous Korean socks. You can find a variety of street food here as well. My personal favourite is the deep fried twisted potato. Overall, this is a great place for shopaholics."
Highly Recommended!,"Myeongdong Shopping Street market is the place you can find everything 'under one roof' sans The Roof :). As an avid traveller, it is a good sign to know that even the locals shop there. Food-stalls, restaurants (burgers, Thai, steamboat, etc), fashion, cosmetics, shoes, the list goes on. The ambience at night got me excited, even if you are not a keen shopper, you can just have coffee and people-watch. "
Perfect ,The street food and shopping are amazing. Would recommend people to check this place out. I have really enjoyed the street food. 
Affordable price,"Very happening starting from 5 till morning, love ❤️ them street food , & affordable price, for sure we will be back"
Very Korean (in both a good and bad way),"This district is THE shopping area of Seoul. There are many different shops with different price ranges. You can mainly find a lot of (Korean) cosmetic shops here. I personally loved shopping here. The only real downside is that the helpers in the shops keep walking up to you and they don't leave you alone. I felt quite uncomfortable a few times. Despite the awkwardness, I will come back when I visit Seoul. "
City with life,"From apparels, makeup to food, this part of Seoul is not to be missed. It is always bustling with life and full of surprises. The MCM boutique is a must visit if you don't want to be disappointed by the lack of items in the latest collection. Stylenanda's Pink Hotel boutique offers a different view of shopping experience with different theme on each floor, and mostly clad in pink! The street comes alive in the evening with food stalls on carts. if you run out of luggage space, there are shops readily available to see to your needs. Tired legs? The streets are clad with cafeterias and restaurants perfect to rest your feet and fill your hungry stomach. "
My first time in Myeongdong shopping streets,"First time in Myeongdong....lots of face, body and hair products. Enjoy the street food....but it's surely more pricey than local food market. Nice cool weather today for walk along shops in Myeongdong "
Heaven for beauty shoppers,There is really no other place quite like this! Its def worth checking out during the day and the evening. As its very different. Lots of great korean beauty products on offer. 
Night Shopping,"The street shopping starts at 5pm. You can reach there early to shop on the front shop and follow up with the street shopping. As usual, the shop are usually cosmetics and street stalls are more on foods. "
Meongdong!!!!,"Meongdong is one of the most visited streets in korea. I see many foreigners here, and everyone seems to be enjoying this place. This is one of the must visit places in korea!!!! Highly recomend it!!!!!!"
Shopping street for girls who like facial products,This is a shopping streets for girls. 80% of the retail shops are meant for girls. Alot of restaurants and street food stalls around. So you wont feel hungry. It is very packed in the night time. 1 to 2 days should be good enough unless you want see every single shop products. Alot of repeated stores in this shopping streets. 
FUN!!!!,The street food were awesome!!! Freebies are good too!! It was fun to go to Myeongdong. It was like Hong Kong!
Very busy and people like directing you to their shops.,"Been here many times, the street food are good and many options. There are lots of cosmetic shops and the sales like directing you inside. The street is packed all the time and very touristic. It's worthy to visit for first time tourists coz you can find all the Korean cosmetic shops there, plus some fashion brands, a good place for shopping."
Fun shopping street,"My daughter and I had a great time shopping here. She loves Korean cosmetics and they have it all. Late in the afternoon , all of the food vendors come out . Lots of delicious snacks and drinks. "
Who can resists Myeongdong Shopping Street??,"I stayed nearby Myeongdong station exit 4 and every night this is my favourite spot. It is very lively but not as crowded, you can still enjoy the lovely atmosphere here. There are plenty of shops/ stalls where you can shop and eat. You can try all sort of famous korean street food here. Famous cosmetic brands are available every corner in myeongdong street."
Everything ,Huge shopping mall with every designer label you can think of. Food court on lower floor and food was good with huge selection. Just point if you think know they don't understand but I ordered spicy prawns with rice and it was excellent. If you go at the weekend though be warned it is very busy 
"Free Hanbok Experience,,great","At Seoul Global Center,they offer free hanbok get ups, plus interesting workshops .Next visit,will check their schedules as it is not only shopping but learning new arts and crafts ..."
Myeongdong by night,"This is the place to sample street food, the ones you don't normally find in your hometown, its not cheap but what the heck, you're on holiday & you want to give it a try. Shopping is the other magnet here, you'll find all the international brands plus some local ones, especially in cosmetics. Its something akin to Osaka's Dotonburi. Overall well worth a visit."
The most lively place in Seoul,"Just like what you have read or heard. It is the busiest district, filled with shops, stalls and restaurants. Go there hungry and try all the Korean famous street foods for average of KWR 30/dish. Probably too squishy for little children. Not so stroller friendly as the place is often packed with tourists. "
Shopping galore,"Myeongsont Shopping Street is a good place for, well, shopping. There is a hotel that sits around the district & what our Filipino community recommends is to stay there, we opted not to because we knew that there will be a lot of people.I gave it a 4 star is because we were able to go to a place were there is less people & have the same shops so to me, it's just the hype."
Cosmetic/shopping haven,Truly a cosmetic and shopping haven. :) interesting finds at discounted prices with freebies. I look forward to going to Seoul because of Myeongdong experience
Shopping and eating for all,"Well known for their beauty shops, in fact a bit too much of in your face selling. Shoving masks in your hand , left right and.center. Apart from that, plenty of delicious food, cafe's of all types and night street food. Must go and stay place."
Great vibes!!,"This is a great place for shopoholics and for people who savour street food. Most of the food vendors put up there stalls post 5 pm , so if you are visiting the street post 5pm you will find great food options with amazing vibe all over the area. Its definitely worth visiting once for shopping and interesting food vendors."
A must-do experience,"So much shops, and street food. One can collect face masks by just going inside beauty shops. Although prices are not really that cheap as buying them online, it is still one of the highlights of our Seoul trip."
Bargain hunters paradise,"This is a great place to experience a real ""open market"". Endless vendors for clothing, souvenirs and food. Shop where the locals shop!"
Huge,"A branded shopping area.. very commercialized and full of tourist.Many branded products and a sea of beauty shops. you can get good street food here too,A must place to go if your are a tourist."
A place for street food,My 2nd visit and yes lesser Chinese but more Indonesian and Vietnam people. Otherwise lesser crowded now and thus easier to shop
Shooooooping,"Shopping, shopping and shopping. The main street is crowded with food stalls and each corner leads to yet another shop. Recommend a walk around even if you're not up for shopping just to get a feel of the shopping craziness."
"Shop, Walk, Eat, Happy","Thriving shopping street in Seoul. Lots to see, lots to buy, lots to eat. My personal favorite shops are Stylenanda a boutique fashioned in the style of hotel, Aland a boutique selling fashionable clothes by local designers - but the decor is interesting - with worn & torn leather chairs, old luggages, really old radios & more. Go see for yourself if you are in Myeondong"
Shopping place for young people,"Young people would like this place as it has lots of shops catered for them. Food is readily available too. It feels like Ximending of Taipei. There are many restaurants and street food but the street food aren't cheap. Clothes are also not the cheapest here. I personally feel clothes are cheaper in subway basements where most things go for 10000won. Here they may cost about 20 to 50% more.Still, a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul for the first time."
So much to do!!!! ,"One of the highlights of my trip. Myeongdong is packed with stores, stalls, and delicious street food!!! It has a lot of alleys with stunning neon lights at night. Make sure to allot at least 3-4 here because there's just so much to do!! "
Hub of shopping,"This is a must see when traveling in Korea. So many stores foreign and local with a great feel to the Korean culture around beauty, shopping, and kitchy little Korean glam. "
Don't miss it!,"You can find everything here, cosmetics, clothes, footwears, CD store, Daiso, money exchange, Korean spa, a lot of restaurants. If you come in the evening, there are a lot of street stalls selling food, bags, scarves, mobile phone cases, etc. that attract a lot of people."
Shopping and food!!!,For cosmetics lovers this is the place for you!! There are also a lot of nice delicious street foods!!! The push carts will start around 5pm till late. The foods are a MUST TRY!!! There are plenty choices of halal foods too!! 
Bustling with energy!,"Interesting market. Has good shops on both sides of the streets, and vendors in the middle of the streets. Very energetic. Vendors range from those selling socks and battery operated children's toys to food carts with the preparation of foods in full view, be it pomegranate juice or potato chip skewer. One particular attraction was a lady adding simple sugar in a small bowl and stirring it over a bunsen burner and converting it to candy..a big hit with children. Another area with long lines was a soft icecream vendor. His attraction was a cone of icecream that was 32 cm. high. No kidding! Lots of interesting vendors and lots of crowds and high energy. Loved it! A must visit market!"
Everything you want,"You can buy everything here, cosmetics, great street food, clothes, exchange your money. It's crowdy, specially during weekends, but worth visiting."
You have to go,"If you like shopping or not, just go. you will end up buying something even if it is street food which is awesome!"
Family Shopping,My family and I visited this shopping district and we had a wonderful time out. We found great deals and hidden gems.
croweded with people......,"for those ""shopperholic"", this is the place for you........there are too many facial/mask or Korean brands shops at this location......"
Shopping Paradise,"Great place for shoppers whereby you can shop till you drop!! Plenty of cosmetics, clothings, shoes etc to choose. However, most brand shops are duplicate. Restaurants are also pretty easy to find."
Great shopping streets,U can spend the whole day here shopping and eating.. whole stretch of beauty product shops as well as restaurants to go to n not forgetting start food.. 
Excellent Place for Shopping and Street Food,"We had fun shopping at Myeongdong Shopping street, especially the street food. Excellent choices from Angus Beef Slices, Cheesy Butter Scallop, Chicken Korean Style, to Fresh Fruit Juices. Enjoyed every minute of the tour. Well recommended esp to foodies"
crowded and average service,"This is my second time to be here and i will be here again because my friends never been to Seoul before.This place is full of clothes-selling shops, eateries and massage shop. I dislike to be here because it is so crowded and the average service attitudes.It is easy to get lost here, since many alley and not much public toilets available"
On the list,"Nice to visit and experience locals, food and items that can be brought home. Recommended stop after visiting serious stuff "
My first time in Seoul,"Very crowded, a lot of street food, a lot of vendors, and a lot of stores for clothing and cosmetics. It is a great tourist spot for shopping and food, a little to crowded for my liking but still a good and seems to be a safe spot to visit. "
"Eat, Eat, Eat","If you looking for street food, this is the right place to go because street food everywhere in here and not just street food u can buy cosmetics in here too."
Staffs know mandarin but not friendly,"I like to shop in myeongdong but most of the staffs were not friendly. They know how to speak in multi languages like mandarin, Japanese, english etc. They are very aggressive but they didn't listen to what you need. However there are few shops with nice staffs too but can be counted using one hand."
 Very commercial,Busy part of town and ok if you like chain stores/ high end shopping. Plenty of food available usually at inflated prices. I lived Seoul but this was not my favourite part. 
Mix of high end shops and bargains ,"Arrived at 9pm on a Friday and it was packed. Vast area with brand name stores that you see on 5th Ave, but also small bargain shops and street vendors. "
5th Avenue in Korea,"We enjoyed window shopping in this area, but really didn't too high end for us. We did enjoy a nice lunch in the food court in the basement of the Lotte Department store. Lot's of good items to choose from."
Shopping while in Seoul,"Taking a break from work, we decided to go shopping. Lots of nice local stuff and some traditional retailers. But, it would help to speak Korean to get the real deals. We felt like being American was a disadvantage. The jewelry was nice and there was some negotiating starting at 30% off and going as far as 35, but it still seemed high."
My day trip to Seoul,"This was one of the best parts of my trip. I took the blue line Subway and changed to the 4 line and went shopping. This place has many many makeup stores and discounted prices. In the evening or late after noon there are food vendors set up all along the streets. There are also great restaurants on the side streets. There are department stores as well as boutiques. I am large compared to the locals but I found a sweater coat, a shirt as well as face masks, eyebrow pencils, lipsticks that would go well with my dark skin color also. It was just great. I went back three times during my time in South Korea. "
COSMETIC HEAVEN,"Out of four days in Seoul, we spent two straight days here. And I mean all day. Save yourself some time by doing some homework of which products or at least brands you want to try or purchase. If not, you'll be spending hours here just walking in and out of every store. Each major brand will have at least 5-8 branches within a few block radius so don't sweat if you changed your mind. Feel free to go in and try and ask questions. The staff are quite incredible almost everywhere. Multi lingual and really helpful. The street vendors sell great stuff too at incredible cheap prices. However. Don't forget to haggle! (Not with the food vendors) "
expensive stores good street food,"Myeongdong Street market is a lot like an outdoor mall. It had all the big, brand name stores like Forever 21 and Zara. In my opinion, it was a little bit of a let down to learn that the street vendors, including the street food, didn't come out until night time. But it's certainly a good area to walk through, though I would not say its cheaper in Korea if you're shopping at the brand name stores."
"Hustle and bustle, but delicious!","Visited the street with two young (and fussy) eaters at around 7pm at night and must have gained 4lb in weight!?Gorged ourselves on dumplings, Korean fried chicken, grilled steak, spiral potatoes, cheesey hash brown type things, strawberries and honey goldfish ice creams.Fresh, affordable and delicious.The subway is nearby, taxis are cheap and easy to find and if you need help there is a tourist police office in the middle and at the end of the street"
Myeongdong items were too pricey,"It's a shopping haven for shopaholic like Me. But I've been to nandaemun and got the chance to compare it with the items sold here. Imagine 1 pack of strawberries in namdaemun costs only 2,000KRW while in Myeongdong they were selling it for 5,000KRW. Some of the vendors don't even give you discounts. My sister wanted to buy those Korean Hats that were sold along the streets of Myeongdong. The vendor said its 50,000KRW. We were in awe because the original Baseball caps were only sold 39,000KRW at Lotte World Mall. Anyways, this place is fantastic for those picture perfect areas.. But if you want to save than splurge more than what you're budget then I suggest you consider Namdaemun instead of Myeongdong. "
Wow. what a place,you can shop for anything over here. Best known for make up things .A few big Shopping Mall caters for all need
"interesting place to shop, especially for the ladies.","A very big place to shop, dine and drink coffee to relax. Especially for the ladies. Alot of cosmetic shop to get all your facial and bodies needs. Basically, i like the street food compare to the restaurant."
"Great Street Food, Tons of Shopping","Came here for the Nanta Show and loved all the great street food! My favorites were the mandoo (dumplings) and spicy beef meatballs. Lots of shopping, especially of beauty products. Easy to get disoriented since the same shop will be in 3 or more locations, so you may want to stop by the tourist information area to get a map that shows the names of all the stores on it. There are also 3 movie theaters in this area."
Favorite food area!,"I LOVED walking in this area and checking out the numerous food vendors. I enjoyed it so much I returned for a second visit! It is fun to slowly browse and scope out the available foods. There were guides there to answer tourists' questions. I was not interested in shopping for other items, but there were numerous stores for those that are looking to make some purchases."
awesome!,"so much fun here, ate to much, drink to much!, bought to much!.....lobsters, abalones, hot dogs, juices, etc etc"
Excellent for crazy cosmetic shoppers,"The cosmetics there doesn't stick in one price and the prices are negotiable. They even gave us free gifts and extra samples. Tax rebate is up to certain amount. Besides shopping, there are nice street food everywhere too! Don't forget to try the caramel sugar! "
Super packed & fun,"Can be overwhelming but is a must see - great for shopping, especially for skin products. At night the food stalls start selling all kinds of street food. "
"Its all about street food, skincare, cosmetics, and buy 1 get 1","Its SUPERB and PERFECT for both men and women. While your ladies are going crazy to shop their buy 1 get 1 sheet mask and stuff, you can just go grab a baked cheese scallop or tteokpokki and etc. Its just crazy in Myeongdong. The street food taste sooooo amazing, and so many unique and tempting snack too..ahh.. i would love to go back to korea soon..very soon hopefully.."
Shop till you drop,"You can probably find everything in Myeongdong area, we had lunch, shopping, dinner and more shopping there! You will definitely need to bargain for price with Street vendors!! We got ripped off on those seaweed snacks and found much cheaper ones in supermarket nearby! But it was a lot of fun trying street foods from those vendor stores! "
Touristy,"It's a very touristy place and I can understand why as it has it all! I can say that 90% of K beauty products has their store at Myeongdong, the only difference is the promotion might be different from store to store at different location and the samples they are giving are lesser. I still don't think is a major issue since I'm not paying for the samples but for the product I purchase so not a problem to the later. The food stall is a little overrated and it's not cheap but for first timer I still think you should try.Now, for stalls on the street selling bags, socks, etc. I don't recommend you buy at myeongdong, it is so much cheaper to get it from Underground shopping, the one that I found it good is Gangnam Underground shopping. E.g. I bought laptop bag for KRW10k at Gangnam underground shopping but Myeongdong selling at KRW15K."
Good street food,Yes this street is renowned for its shops that sell beauty products but we really have to talk about the great street food available on the weekends. Go around late afternoon when all the stalls have set up for the evening.
"Like Black Friday, if it didn't suck","Myeongdong was an absolute madhouse and I enjoyed every second of it. We did very little actual shopping here but visited three times just for the fun of it. At night, the main street had a couple dozen food stalls. I tried about five of them one night and they were all delicious. If nothing else, you've got to come here to experience the mass of humanity and light and sound."
Paradise for Beauty Product Lovers,I super love the place! We came here three times during our stay at Seoul. If you love beauty products this is the place to go. There also a lot of street food to try and also boutique shops and all. We also got our souvenirs bought here. A must go place in Seoul.
Must visit shopping area and street food,"Lots of things are happening on this street. Will take you more than 3 hours, luckily I chose this neighborhood to stay. You can get any kind of Korean cosmetic and make-up products, international fashion brands, local fashion brands, local mom and pop shops, street food (only in evening) and duty-free shops. I found the best food gem to be the local places upstairs or in the basement. I had the best Korean fried chicken there. During christmas time, tons of christmas lights on the buildings and nearby parks."
Always my favourite place in Seoul,"Myeongdong is THE place to be when one visits Seoul. You cannot leave Seoul without coming here for the shopping and the food. We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong so we had access to Myeongdong shopping street right at our doorstep. The street is very vibrant and filled with pushcarts selling typical Korean street foods, tons of cosmetic shops and connects people to many shopping malls and shops that especially appeal to shoppers who wants to buy fashionable and trendy goods. It is a very self-contained street where there are activities for everyone - shops for shopaholics, nice eateries and restaurants for foodies and massage/spas and cafes for the people who wait around for their shopaholic/foodie friends. If you can find the time, you can even take a break from shopping to watch the famous highly popular Nanta show at the Myeongdong Theatre just next to the Myeongdong police station. Serious shoppers will be glad to know that there are many Tax Refunds kiosks and counters located within Myeongdong street so you can conveniently settle your tax refund for all your shopping without doing this at the airport. "
TRADITIONAL KOREAN MARKET,"A nice walk in market for buying traditional Korean stuff from Ginseng, cosmetics, traditional bags and a lot of other typical stuff."
crowded but nice,"a must place for you to shop a nice, cheap things in Seoul..there are hundreds of shop and few shopping malls around myengdong..we enjoyed the street snack there..for moslems.. don""t bother to ask before you buy..."
Happening street. Must visit. ,A lot of street food in the evening and shops to visit. Very convenient as it is located near a lot other places of attractions. 
Shopping & food haven,"This street is alive 24 hours a day ,different delicious food stalls , offering all kinds of food, prices are a bit expensive which is understandable Shopping is every whereThis street is the place to be"
Great prices for local products!,"A must visit for souvenirs, local food and entertainment! Products are fairly priced and some vendors encourage a lower price from competitive rivals! A haggler's haven!"
A lot of good deals ,Whole street is full of Korean cosmetics. Sales people are friendly and always give out free goods. Opens til midnight. 
"Good Street Food, Nothing More. ","For one of the most visited destinations in Seoul, I found this place to be pretty disappointing. The street food and carts are what carry it, any other kind if shopping is the same as you would get anywhere else... "
Fun place to shop around,"Lots of cosmetic stores, Korean brand stores and some fun malls. I recommend going in the later afternoon when the food vendors set up and you can snack your way around as you shop. "
Hussle and a bussle for your next bargain,"The buzz of this place esp. in the afternoon when the street food vendors bring their offers, is electrifying. Shop assistants will give you free samples to get you in their shops and spend your money on face mask, fancy clothes and shoes or bags. When you're hungry you simply stop halfway of the street width at nearest vendor for variety of treats or get a green tea latte from a regular coffeshop snd you are good to continue. Shop, shop, shop. "
12000 steps easy.!!!,"If your a shopper it's great ! First time visitors is a must, good products and famous shopping district.Good to explore if your into these kinda things but as you walk around the streets a bit more the shops get repetitive - same shop same brands same products, probably each shop you will see more than 15 times..You might even see the same people hahaTruman Show alike.For the Bloggers it is not similar to Orchard, Pitt Street, Bourke Street or even KLCC - it's original in its own sense.( sorry read too many blogs and it kept saying it's Orchard and CWB)"
Crowds and Shops,"If you are looking for a traditional Korean market, this isn't it. This is a very commercialised area, very, very crowded, with many chain stores. No low prices. It's fun to look around, but is you want deals, go elsewhere. If crowds, loud noises and rude, pushy people bother you, don't go here!Best thing about this place is the street food, and there are some very good local and western restaurants."
Not too much fun.,"Very busy shopping area. Lots of small inexpensive stores. Dirty, noise, overcrowded. Not much fun, don't lose your time"
best for Indian people looking for winter jackets,"this place is like Tank Road market in delhi india, you can shop so much that it would be difficult to take it back to india, i have purchased 12 winter jackets for family/friends from this market and nearby spots"
Nice food,Food is good. But people behave like from the Middle Ages. Korean ladies pushing their way through and even manhandle passerby just to get through
Very touristy place,"I heard from a local that Koreans don't go there anymore since it has become very touristy place and prices had gone up dramatically.Still I went there, only to find he was right. The street feels like a show for tourist with shops and food street but not a real local place like Hongdae for example. It is very crowded and big but with not soul. Only places which are interesting are the Lotte department store, the Lotte young plaza and the big Uniqlo branch (which doesn't have XXL for men at all, so if you're a big guy, forget about it)"
Myeongdong!,Alive and bustling. Truly a visual treat for the senses. Cosmetics and skincare mecca for anyone who is looking to stock up. Plenty of shopping and eating places as well as hotels. Gets very crowded on weekends but all is good. People/vendors are polite and making their way to places they want to go without pushing or shoving despite it being crowded.
Thousands of shops!,"This is the place for beauty product lovers! My wife had a blast at Myeongdong, and our hotel was strategically located here as well. Shopping all day and lots of restaurants around for sustenance in between. If you are a foreigner, bring your passport for duty free discount."
Shop for Beauty Products,"If shopping is your thing, then this is a good place for you. Rows and rows of shop selling beauty products and a lot of street food around as well. Some brands are repetitive though. Definitely recommend for those who loves cosmetic and beauty product ,you will be spoil with so many choices."
Lots of the same stuff repeated,"Was excited to see all the street food stands until I walked around for awhile and saw that they were all repeated several times. Same with the street vendors for like hats, etc. Otherwise, it's mainly cosmetics and some clothing stores and not that exciting."
Myeongdong shopping,This is a great place to buy Korean cosmetics as all of the shops are in one place and they seem to repeat on every block. There is also some great street food and restaurants to eat at along the way. Lots of great shops and interesting things to buy.It gets very busy so be prepare for some crowds.Try the Hotteok! :)
Have Fun Shopping,"Felt like they have thousands of shops just selling cosmetic...plenty of restaurant to choose from...if you are not a shopper, just go there and look at the foot traffic - can see all kinds of people..."
Shopping beauty products ,"Wow! If your intention is to shop beauty products, this is the place. All along the street, it's difficult to decide in which one to buy. Walk also through the little streets on the corners, you might find some different things."
You feel the city's life,In this street you will find finger food restaurants bars and lots of stores playing k-pop music You feel like you share this special culture in this street which get animated at the sundown No need to spend too much time though if you don't like crowded places 
Shop and then shop some more,"So many shops for make up, cosmetics, accessories, eateries (at night), restaurants during the day, shoes, etc. "
Heart of Seoul,If you are in Seoul try to take a stroll through the thoroughfares of Myeongdong. This part of Seoul is bustling with life and is busy throughout the day. Main attractions are it's shops and the array of different restaurant and open air food stalls
South Korea on one street,"All of South Korea's major retailers and products are found in and around this bustling street. With clean hawker street food and clean brightly lit shops, the street almost feels akin to a theme park with an lively ambience. "
A must to see in Seoul ,This place has many shops and many food street stalls.. the food is very delicious and the variety is very good.Highly recommended. . I think islts the heart of Seoul. .Ps. Take cash with u as all stalls dont have credit card machines.. Many things are irresistible to buy.. Most of those shops close by 10 30 PM .. so plan well .
Shoppingggg for young generation,"Just prepare your Korean won and walk along the street. If you have nothing to buy ,just enjoy the food. From Halal Kebab right up to the lobster cooked with cheese. Oh man...it is soo delicious. "
Bussy bussy bussy,This place is busy all the time. But it is really worth the walk an experience. They have all type of shops and restaurants at night time they havr food venders. 
Beauty products and food street,"I have heard about this place from so many people and finally i make it here myself. There were lots of China tourist filled up most of the shops.... prices are no longer as attractive due to all these over demand, We can now buy the products online from the Korean retailer at cheaper price and send right to your door step."
This is where you'll feel alive!,"Clothes, souvenirs, cafes, restaurants, cosmetic and skin care products (endless of them), this place is always bustling from the moment the shutters are up all the way till 11pm when most of the street hawkers retire the night! The things to look at and the temptation to empty your money pouch is endless, so please bring enough cash (or a credit card) if you want to take a stroll down Myeongdong!You will see all sort of people and all sort of stores opened in this stretch and it reminds me of Taipei's very own Ximending shopping street but Myeongdong is in my opinion twice bigger, cleaner and very much more vibrant.Take the exit 6 or 7 at Myeongdong station and you'll be here in no time!This place is also friendly to muslim travellers with abundance of Halal food establishments - so eating in Seoul is really not a problem!"
Fun wandering,"I simply adore outdoor market. Whether you are a big shopper at heart or you just want to window shop, this is a place to experience. I ended up with more stuff than I intended to get, but it was so fun. The Asian side of me enjoyed bargaining; and teasing of the vendors. One shop owner ended up giving me lots of extra 'samples'; and sent me off with ""I love you"" after I bit him farewell with 'Happy New Year'. On the eating side, I watched two guys made a fresh fish cake stick a size of my arm; and resolved to try one. I would say that if my stomach is tribble size in capacity, I probably would be eating all evening walking around there. It is simply entertaining just to see all the different street food. If you are a foodie, go nuts!"
Good atmosphere to soak in!,"Many many brands (mostly cosmetics) along the street and many interesting street food. As a muslim traveller, I was very happy to have found a few halal stalls and 1 restaurant which provided halal dishes. The duty free mall and underground shopping centre are also worth visiting!"
Shopping Street with everything,Nice shopping streets and side lanes offered good bargin beauty products and delicious street food and good restaurants. At the end of the main shopping street are Lotte Departmental Store and plenty of Duty Free Shops that you could spend whole day there.IT is a MUST visit when you go to Seoul.Highly recommended !
Shop and eat,"You can buy clothes, toys, souvenirs, food, perfumes, cosmetics beauty products (very popular) and have very good moments.Don't forget to try fried seafood."
Night walk in a typical modern Asian outdoor market,I took my family to Seoul for a long weekend and I wanted them to experience a outdoor market. Considering my daughter isn't quite ready to go native we went to the Myeongdong market. The kids enjoyed the banana crunch crape and they were exited to experience the energy.Getting around Seoul by subway is easy. We let our daughter figure out how to get there and she did very well. Being outside in March is a little cool temperature wise so dress warm.
Brimming w street foods n pushcarts,"A must see!!! U get to taste the different street foods all in one straight lane. Pushcarts selling all sorts of Korean touristy snacks like seaweeds, flavored almonds, Korean strawberries etc n socks that are selling for KRW1000 = SGD1.25!! Really good quality. Shops lining the sides are usually cosmetic shops, fashion apparels n restaurants. We stayed in myeongdong n were super happy that these conveniences are within arms reach to our hotel. We were never hungry "
Shopping and dining ,Shopping paradise for ladies. Lot of cosmetic shops with offers. Lot of must try street food stalls. Also other restaurants like cat-cafe and dog-cafe are there. Interesting visit. 
Beauty product and street food,"You can get different type of face mask in this area. Go for the better one like innisfree, natural republic etc... tourist can ask for tax refund. All sorts of street food available if you are hungry after a long day walk. Range from 2,000 won for egg bread to 15,000 won for lobster bbq. "
Fantastic area to base yourself in or visit,"I chose to stay in Myeongdong due to the night markets, which were fantastic. A huge variety of food available to try in small portions, all between 300-500Won. No one hassles you for anything, its not like thailand or china, all very polite and civilised. "
"Nice food, a loooott make up store, crowded street","a lot of street food can be chosen, from sweet to saviour. A lot of make up store is available. Try to avoid this street when peak time (i think when people got back home from work)."
Your Shopping and Food Paradise!,"Plenty of Cosmetic Shops, but some branded keep repeat be themselves along the streets. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants as well, price is on the high side if compare to other places.Well, enjoy the environment, would be back if bringing first timer."
Shop some local cosmetics ,"As KOREANS are well kwonn with their pristine face skins, here is to find out how they make that.A chic place to do shoppings or even just to spend some time enjoying the environement.The street foods are great. Try and share 2 or 3 foods with your travelling mates"
must visit when in seoul,"crowded in most evening and shopping heaven for the ladies. As for me, i cant get enough of the street food and that is why i keep going back to myeongdong."
Very crowded,"Very crowded place. You can easily get lost. Tourissm information bureau, in middle of Namdaemun street, is helpful. Difficult to find English speaking Koreans. But worth to visit and watch people and enjoy atmosphere. Visited alpha store nearby. It is a real heaven for handcrafters."
"Fun, busy intense",Loved it all especially the street food and cute stuff! Overload of cuteness I. Korea. Lots of coffe shops made it a great place to wander and rest in no particular order.
Korean cosmetic mecca!,"This street is full of Korean cosmetic leading brands. Several shops fir the same brand in a row. I don't use make up; but I am fond of skin care products. On purchase of 35,000 Wong the shipping becomes tax free. Innisfree and Lotte duty free refund tax in the store. All other stores provide a coupon that can be claimed at the airport. I could find all korean brand outlets. Tonymoly was only available in Lotte duty free 11F. Nature republic had but 1 get one free offer so was a good buy!"
A bite of everything ,"This is a good place to have different types of street food,expensive but worth it. The one I loved was the cheese lobster, but some other were also good.If you want to have your lunch here, be prepared to expend a lot of cash, but if you just try it as some snacks is ok."
Seoul searching: A solo traveler's diary,"I was staying near Myeongdong streets so every night it was always my last stop from wherever i was before going back to my hotel. The busy streets of Myeongdong will definitely lift everyone's spirits. Tourists and locals were busy walking, shopping, window shopping and eating. Skin care products were all over these streets and freebies were just about the same. My favorite skin care brand Skinfood was on sale, and i was able to score 10 pcs of sheet masks plus another 10 for only ₩10,000, about P350.00 here in Manila. If you'll purchase it here 1 mask costs P75.00. It was a huge sale in my opinion. Needless to say, i bought a lot and a lot more of their products at Lotte Duty Free where everything was also on sale and way cheaper. Once i got tired of too much browsing, an array of yummy street foods were just a few steps away. I tried almost everything, gimbap, tteokbokki, octopus bbq and sandwich, pomegranate juice, shrimp, crabs, crablets, lobster all of which were breaded and fried and came with a special sauce, odeng, hotteok, kimchi pancake and bunggeopang. I was there for 5 straight nights, no wonder i was able to taste a lot for dinner. Shopping in Myeongdong was 24/7 but my legs can't cope up anymore with the city's business not to mention the places i visited during day time. When i come back to Seoul, i will definitely go back here every night. I'm in love with Myeongdong.❤❤❤"
Heaven for make-up shoppers,"This place is a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul. Even if you are not planning to buy any makeups, I think it is worth visiting to feel the atmosphere. A lot of nice and unique street food sold in the area too. Moreover, because the place is very touristy, most sellers and waiters in restaurants can speak English."
Myeongdond shopping street,"My hotel is only 10 minutes walk to the main shopping streets, there must be 4 or 500 shops in that area, mainly cosmetic and fashion , lots of local restaurants , you can spend hours or days , also good bargain prices."
Exciting gift shops and street food,"There are plenty of different choices in this district to buy the souvenir or gift from authentic Korean artifacts to fridge magnets, fun to wander around the many streets and window shop, and every opportunity to eat the many street vendor food, form ice-cream to seafood"
cosmetic heaven,"if you are a woman and love make up, this is the place to go. with affordable price, you can spend hours in this place just for make-up shopping."
"Shopping, Dinning, Experiencing ","Exciting hotspot for days and nights. Attractive and creative side street food stalls, such as fresh grill cheese mini lobster, steamed egg bread, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, rose shape icecream........"
Shopping ,"Myeongdong is a 'must' visit place for visitors to Seoul . The place opens around 10am and closes around 11.30pm.This shopping belt is world reknown for its shops and stores selling branded cosmetics. Other items sold include clothes and footwear.For the more adventurous, do try the hawker fare selling baked scallops, baby lobsters, croissants. As they are freshly baked, the risk of developing a bad tummy is very minimal, I should think. There are also numerous small and mid size restaurants offering Korean bar-b-q of grilled fish, beef , pork and chicken. For those who like to taste local Korean cuisine, visitors will be spoilt for choices. All orders come with a serving of kim chee , bean sprouts and vegetables . Rice is an optional order . I was there twice , and tonight I enjoyed being there just soaking up the atmosphere to see the huge crowds streaming in and the neon lightings similar to what you can see in Times Square though not as magnificent.The place is highly recommended."
Best shopping area in Seoul,"My favorite thing on my Korea trip was definitely shopping in Myeongdong. Excellent street food, restaurants, beauty stores, and right by the subway station. The employees in the stores were nice and also spoke English. You can also ask for discounts and samples and they will usually give them to you which was great! Loved Myeongdong and I wish I could go there again!"
A must go!,"Best place in Seoul.Best place for shopping and other things.There are many restaurants, cafes, etc.There are even theme cafes here, I visited many cat cafes, dog cafes..My hotel was here, I never regretted the location, best location ever.Visited in Summer of 2015"
Shoppers and foodie heaven,This place really wakes up later in the day. If you're looking for somewhere to go early in the day this isn't the place. The range of shops and street food available is plenty and very affordable too. You'll end up eating at every stall!
Winter Time,Nothing much to see there - maybe it's winter season? Went to a few malls and mostly selling same clothes too.
Best places in Korea for shopping and eating ,"I like myeong dong the best in Korea, a lot of street food along the way with the shopping mall , and good food restaurant is all around. You can explore a lot of stuff in here , I went here during January and is the coldest winters time month. I will come here again "
Sun,Love the shopping area!! Lots of great restaurant and name brand stores. Very crowded. Walking distance from our hotel. The Hotel offer shuttle bus but walking is only 10 min. away. Very safe area. 
Heaven for girls,"Best to come night timeNear train stationA long street of korean skin care and make up, affordable shoes (les more shop) and local foodYou may find non korean brands in Olive Young (e.g Nuxe)Lotte young dept store is across the street, you may find april skin there, if you are looking for one. I recognized only h&m, uniqlo, forever 21 and zara for clothing boutiques, others maybe i dont know the brandTheres a mcdonalds near the center intersection Theyre also offering tax refund slip if you buy more than 30k wonMoney changer is presentInnisfree, Missha, etude house, tony moly and the saem are the common brands along the myeongdong street, you can find more than one storeSome stores were giving away free masks No japanese brands like shisheido, hada laboI cannot find perfume boutiques maybe not enough for me to see thoseYou may also see the subway with cheaper clothing line up, if youre a kpop fan youll definitely should consider it, you can also see posters of popular kpop artists being sold there"
The place to be!,"Well this is the place to be when in Seoul , lot is of tourist destination close by, for shoppers it's heaven. Must Exchange your money here cause it gives you the best exchange rates and in Seoul."
Visited 3x on our 7 day trip!,Lots and lots of shops! The street food at night are not to be missed! Nearby Lotte mall also has good food choices in the basement food court. 
A must do!,"Street food, shopping for dayyyz and dog cafes! Exciting and nothing like anything you could ever imagine!"
Food and shopping paradise,"Myeongdong shopping street is full of cosmetic shops; fashion stores; restaurants; cafe (even cat cafe; dog cafe!) and of course the night market with all the street vendors' stalls along the whole street. Quite fun going from stall to stall to see how they cook the various food. The variety is enormous from giant clams, lobster, various kinds of pancakes, grill meat, to candy floss, roasted chestnuts & sweet potato and freshly pressed juices. Just amazing!"
Fabulous energy at night! ,"Wow, this place was amazing! Crazy busy with shop after shop of skin care, face masks, shoes, food etc.etc. Lots of street food & market style stalls too. Nighttime is definitely the time to come as the lights & people really make it exciting! Open most nights till 10pm, it's a shopping Mecca! Must visit if you are in Seoul, just to feel the craziness! "
Cuteness Overload,"Streets and streets of cheap Korean makeup, fashion, food, and so much more! Could spend a full day here shopping and eating, and you still probably won't see all of it. It's a literal maze! The street food is delicious and cheap! Wouldn't recommend for those claustrophobic and don't like big crowds."
Shop and eat till you drop!,"So many shops that you just have to be aware of which way you have turned so you don't get lost!If you are hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants and street food around. Wear good shoes as you will be walking heaps!"
Too many people ,"Been there several time, it is a good place for money exchange, and the foreigner friendly show and restaurants. Big chain stores that often occupies whole building floors. But, just way too many people walking on the street and a lot of repeated food vendors."
Good and nice place for shopping and walking,"One of the famous place for tourist in Seoul. The place is good for relax or even just for walking.There are many mini market, store, restaurant, cafe and coffee bar.Open time start at 4:00PM until 11:00PM. More better at night while the LED with full color is everywhere"
"If you love shopping and want lots of shops and street food, this is your place","Walking distance from Naemdaemun shopping, this area is full of fun street foods, little trendy skin-care and fashion shops, and lots of trendy, interesting, foreign foods. Personally, I tend to prefer places like Namdaemun and Gwangjang, but for people who LOVE Harajuku and that trendy collegiate-youth-ish vibe, they'll dig this area, too. There's a lot of fun stuff here to check out, so don't be shy. "
Night Shopping And Snacking Place Bursting With Energy,"The whole area is filled with street vendors peddling local snacks and shops selling not expensive stuff. Very touristy feel. If you are looking for good fine dining and branded items, this is not the place for you. "
Crazily busy with lots of food selection from street food to proper restaurants,"A deffo great place for cosmetics shopping and relaxing at nice cafe or having a meal here. Personally, I found their street food interesting and worth a try. The only tip is when buying cosmetics, select the shop carefully, even under the same brand, the extra gifts could be different."
Shop....eat....shop some more!,"The Myeongdong underground subway shopping is already exciting but once you get out of Exits 6 or 7, you've stepped into a shopper's paradise! The streets are closed to vehicular traffic which makes it easier to ""navigate"" this shopping district of streets and alleyways. Not only will you find skin care and make up stores one after another, but there are also clothing, shoes, jewelry, hats, etc. and the food stalls....you can have a feast of specialty seafood -- lobsters, crabs, clams, scallops, along with the usual Korean food plus fresh fruit juices, ""foot high"" ice-cream cones, etc. Restaurants of various cuisines are all over if you prefer to dine-in. Lotte Department store is in the area also where the food court offers a good variety of mostly Asian food. Their bakeries are not too be missed. Plan to spend at least two days in this area."
Just go see the place,Even if you aren't going to shop (because Seoul is quite pricy) just go walk through the street. Its a great experience and feel. Has all these lovely fresh fruit juice stalls.
Street Food,I didn't really do any shopping during my time at myeongdong.. I mostly went to the different stalls at night to get street food. My favorite stall is the tteokbokki at the corner with the guy serving it.. 
Beauty Haven,"This is my wife's favorite place as of now, of course just next to Heaven. All of her beauty needs in just one place. A must go destination for ladies for all their beauty needs."
Everything you need is in here,"You can buy any cosmetic your wife, friend or even your mother would like, try many kinds of delicious food, watch korean traditional performances, and all thing you want to shop is here.Only a few minutes by walking to reach Nam Dae Moon market, where I always by camera and accessories with very good price, wide range of product.Nice place to visit."
Crazy shopping experience,"This is my first visit to Seoul and my hotel is just minutes walking distance from this famous shopping street. I was bombarded by many salesgirls from endless skin care shops like Nature Republic, Face Shop, Innisfree, etc. They were giving out free masks but you're required to go in and shop something. Well, I 'accidentally' bought about 100 pieces of masks on my first day as I was just overwhelmed with all the options. Anyhow, it was quite an interesting experience but I'll suggest you do some research as to what products you like. I'm just giving the masks as souvenirs. "
Shopping galore ,This place is literally filled and jammed packed with cosmetic products. Rows after rows of them. As a bloke I found the street food amazing and was stuffing my face while the girls shopped for the latest placental face cream etc... Few restaurants and cafes to stop and have a quick drink/ bite. May get crowded at times but all in good fun right? 
Street food heaven.,"This is the best place to try south korea's street food. Be there early around 3 pm until 11 pm to experience food trip. Food price ranges from 1,500 Korean won to 15,000 won just for street food. Always share the food with your friend / companion is order to taste a little bit of everything. "
Day of Shopping,A very big shopping area with many shops in the many lanes. We spent half a day there and got lost in the big area.
Busy but clean & safe .,"Busy during the day , but clean and feels safe to wander round. Plenty of street food the day we visited , which was interesting & good to try.Plenty of shops ( a lot of cosmetic ones ) , cafes easy to get there either walking or via the Metro."
Nice shopping at pure Korean style,It is probably one of the most representative places for shopping. It is extremely crowded so I won't recommend to visit with kids. There are all kind of stores from local to international brands. Not luxury shopping at all. 
Shops shops shops,Jees there are a lot of shops there. You can buy many things (be ready.. them pokemons are everywhere). Lot's of street food places too.. Over priced if you ask me.. You can try one or two things but for food Seoul has many much better places.And crowded fur sure. So if you just want to have a relaxing walk this might not be the place for you.
Should go,Was there in the afternoon but the stores are mostly makeup and women's clothingLots of shops and eating placeWent for coffee very late afternoon and on way to subway after coffee wandered bat into shopping district which had exploded into a vibrant assortment of shops vendors and food standsWhat a welcomed change had dinner at a variety of food stands try as many as you canGo here it is well worth it
Shopping and eating ,"In my opinion Myeongdong is the best Seoul has to offer! From the moment you step onto the street the sounds and scents assaults your senses! The hustle and bustle of persons looking for food, clothes, South Korea's famous face products, specialty cafes is an everyday thing. Never a dull moment here, you could visit everyday for a week and still not experience all it has to offer.It is upscale and Morden with that certain street flair. A must visit if you go to Seoul, if you can live near here, like within walking distance you won't regret it! "
Depends what you looking for,To be honest..nothing really special here..the street food here is actually quite on the high side compare to a meal elswhere..i only came here for a mask shopping which is really cheap depending on the brand you choose..other than that i find item quite pricey here..
Shopping Paradise,"Korea's best known shopping district, many department stores, shops that sell cosmetics, clothes, shoes and accessories. Also, food paradise too!!! Many restaurant choices. If you love Korea beauty product, this is definitely the place to do one stop shopping. Because of the competition, you can always snap good deals too!!Subway Line 2, Euljiro 1-ga Station, Exit 6Subway Line 4, Myeong-dong Station, Exit 6"
Good Place to shop,"This area is a wonderful place to shop for cheap and good stuff especially cosmetic and skin care products, it is also a good place to try their street food "
My favourite place in Seoul,This is definitely the place to stock up on your cosmetics and skincare products. But please do up a shopping list beforehand or else you will be lost in all the different brands and stores. I wouldn't recommend getting clothes from Myeongdong because it is more pricey than Ewha and Hongdae. But the street food is a must-try.
Cosmetic heaven,"If you're looking for Korean cosmetic, any brands, you could find it here. Rows and rows of shops selling cosmetic and trendy clothes with affordable price. "
So crowded and easily get lost. ,"Myeongdong has everything you need in terms of shopping and eating. Thousands of shops, restaurants and kiosks await you there. Since I could not see the sign or the name of the street clearly, and with the crowd walking toward me, I got lost for 4-5 times. If you find what you want to buy, just buy it because it is difficult to find the way back there again. If you want to meet someone, consider the subway station or the post office located outside Myeongdong and then walk to Myeongdong together. Some brands offer you cheap price and it is better to stay there more than 1 hour, depending on your walking and shopping ability. "
Best place to shop!,Hi there. A must visit place here as you can see there are such a paradise for the girls haha. See you again myeongdong!
"Almost impossible to move around freely, too many people","We met with friends here to spend some time together. After the sun went down, the streets were packed, we did not walk...we were moving in waves as people shoved and pushed. We were packed in like sardines in every corner of MyeongDong. I would recommend visiting during the day unless you enjoy this kind of crowd. There are lots of fun street foods to try and great souvenirs to buy here. "
shipping shopping !,"heaven for woman, u can get all sorts of Korean cosmetics from this place, most shops offer in-shop tax refund. the downside will be that it's very touristy, and restaurants around the area is comparatively pricy."
"Lots of Shopping, but tons of crowds","Myeongdong is a very popular tourist shopping area in Seoul - if you want to avoid the crowds and the craziness, there are definitely other more remote but great shopping areas (like the bus terminal/subway districts/Insadong/Itaewon/Dongdaemun, etc). Lots of things to do here though so you won't get bored if you do check it out."
great shopping areas,"Lots of cosmetics store, restaurants, etc around the streets. We never gets enough of this place. We always come back here for eating, strolling around, do some shopping when we visit Seoul. We love this place hohohoho"
Major shopping area - great shopping and great food,"For those who use Korean facial products, Myeongdong is definitely the place to be. As a first timer to Seoul, the streets that are lined with so many shops and brand names was mind boggling. Lots of eateries and cafes too. Our best discovery was a corner stall Great king of castella - Long queue but must try! Overall, a great place, with lots of exciting street food in the evening, eat and walk at the same time!"
Recommended destination,"One of the primary shopping district in seoul. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Myeongdong also has family restaurants, fast food, plus korean, western and japanese dining options. So many place to go in here. You must be here guys.. Dont miss it "
Shopping and street food craze!,"This impressive area is a must-see in Seoul! At first it takes some time to understand the area and market, because it is very very crowded, and with time you get your orientation right.There are many street food vendors with a huge variety of choices - from egg-buns to many different kinds of skewers, from corn to oysters... The price is between 5,000 to 10,000 won per serving, which is quite reasonable - but I have to admit, I could not stop myself from trying almost everything!There is a huge number of cosmetics shops on the street and they are full of people. You can find many kinds of cosmetics from mass brands to quite premium ones. As the street gets more active towards the night, it may be better to walk around Namdaemun Market first, and come to Myeongdong afterwards, because I tried to do the opposite, and all the shops in Namdaemun were closed by 7pm."
Shopping!,"All about shopping for skin care and make-up. Crowded and not so enjoyable to shop. Some of the sales person are not friendly but not all. It is a nice to shop when it’s less crowded, I guess during weekdays or when it’s very cold. Repeated shops but the deals are slightly different. Many restaurants in this area too."
Women's Heaven,"This is the right place to find all kinds of cosmetics...Ladies never leave Seoul without visiting this place. Lots of free samples and very affordable items. also, lots of street food to satisfy your hunger after shopping...a must visit...."
Halal food choice,No problem for Muslim to find foods because there's bunch of choices in Myeongdong from street food to fried rice in Yoogane. 
wow great place in seoul to shop and eat,lots of hotels in the areagreat nightlifelots of shopping areaslots of street foods toovery easy to navigate
Urban Lifestyle + Culture,"Myeongdong didnt fail to impress me. This place is my most favorite spot in Seoul because it offered me heaven as a tourist and as a backpacker. It offered a variety of goods from beauty/hygiene products, clothings, food and experience. This place is so youthful to the extend that Korean Hallyu is really noticeable. I must mention that street foods in Myeongdong are to die for. Swear!"
Great shopping,Great experience but the salespeople are very pushy in the cosmetic stores. Cute socks and very good vendor cart food.
Shoppers Heaven!!,"The food!! The shopping!!! Just beware the clerks. They way oversell everything. But overall..wonderful!! Get a fried potato spiral and green tea/strawberry ice cream ""rose."" Lots of great street food!!"
Place to Shop for Facial Products,"Like what others have commented, this is heaven for people who are looking for Korean facial products. Within a street, you can find 3 to 4 innersfree stores. Ask for discount if you are buying more and they will also throw in a couple of their new products."
Cosmetic Heaven,"Many korean brand cosmetic here. You can find more than 2 same brand in this street. The crowd was happening. in the evening, street food vendor start to set up their table. You will go crazy here ladies. Watchout!!"
Wow ,Wow almost says it all. There is literally something for everyone here. The sights and sounds are amazing. The food the people everything is so different. No matter what your looking for you can find it here.
cheap and crowded place to look around,"We went to Myeongdong on February 2017, the place is full of people, the goods mostly Korean brand but you can find Uniqlo, Zara, Adidas, etc. They have a lot of cosmetics shop, every corner of Myeongdong. Their streetfood stalls are awesome, but lil bit expensive, i think because tourist area. Its hard to find bathroom, i walk into Uniqlo store, and go downstairs twice to find toilet for women. "
Tour as many skincare shops for the free masks!,"This was my first trip to Myeongdong, and upon arriving, instantly realized why it is such an iconic hot spot for tourists and locals alike. From the outstanding and diverse street food offerings such as grilled lobster tail, Havana sweet corn, to the so-highly-raved Dr. Fish pedicures, Hello Kitty Cafe, coveted skin care stores galore, and even a Cat cafe- where you pay to spend time petting cats while you sip your afternoon milk tea! The staff is pretty helpful throughout the stores you visit. Make sure to visit as many skin care stores as possible, as each one you pass, an associate will try to lure you in by giving you a complimentary face mask for visiting their store (which you get to keep even if you don't purchase anything). I don't speak Korean, so the shopping process wasn't really a hassle, as the associates just informed me whether a product was a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, etc. The shops here have everything from Forever 21 and H&M, to high end stores such as Boy, a London based high-end clothing store with edgy fashions. Myeongdong has something for everyone and is easily accessible by Metro, so make sure you create some time to check it out on your next visit to Seoul!"
Shopping area,Good places for food and shopping. They have lots of street food stalls at night and also plenty of korean brand cosmetics shops
good place to shop,"it is cosmetic center in Seoul, located in center of Seoul city. it provides ranges of cosmetic brands"
Never fails to entertain and lift your spirits,"A must do visit for everything. Korean modern culture, shopping, dining, entertainment. It is a regular destination for our family. Get lost in the friendly mayhem"
Shopping Galore,"Myeongdong is a great place to go shopping when you visit Seoul. There are lots of street foods, beauty products with discounts and promotional items and for Catholics you can go and visit the Myeongdong Cathedral."
Best street food and shopping ,"This is a very busy street. I haven't seen so many people in one place before. It is a very nice place for shopping. Shoes, clothing, cosmetics, you name it, you can find anything in here. Don't forget to taste every dish they offer. It's the best street food in the world! "
Nothing Great,"This is purely for cosmetics all around, however there are street food which is nice but expensive. Recommend for girls "
Makeup shopping galore!!,I'm 3 shades darker than any of the makeup products for face offered in ALL of myeongdong but nonetheless i had a great time window shopping. The eats around there and the roadside entertainment can keep you busy ALL day!
Nothing much other then cosmetics,"It's rows and rows of shops selling cosmetics and face masks. Be wary of those touting free samples, as taking a sample will mean you have to pay a visit into the store, and not buying anything could result in them snatching the sample back from you. All a very ride experience. Nonetheless, if you are looking for cosmetics and beauty masks of all sorts, check out the street.During winter months, night market for street food opens after 3pm.."
A MUST see!,"You cannot go to Seoul without roaming down this street! Be sure to eat the street food, it's all delicious! "
Love the Vibe,Eat while you shop! One of the best places to shop in Seoul is Myeongdong Street. Prices are reasonable and cheaper compared to other shopping districts in Seoul. I just loved trying out the street food while hopping from one store to the next. 
Heaven for shopaholic!,"Myeongdong has everything you possibly needs. From over 100 make up counters to boutiques, to a wide range of clothing stores to accessories store. Surrounding the shopping street is street food!! Everything that you see in Korean dramas are all there! "
Must go!,All the yummy street food! Start at 4pm till late night! Lots of restaurants as well. Lots of choices. Lots of shopping though not the cheapest. 
lovely,my hostel is in myeongdong..i was able to try nd eat the street food everyday hahaha..tasted them ..yummy! stir fried rice is burning my mouth to much spicy..i love it.. but too bad got allergy to dried squid..souvenirs are good and i love those socks they are selling..colorful..its a nice place to explore especially on cosmetics nd malls
Good,I went there for the street food at night rather than shopping. You can find cheaper products(from the same brand) in other places.
Seoul,Food. Be sure to try the amazing Korean beef. Melts in your mouth. Street food. Go for the piping hot pancakes. Keeps u comfortably warm. Music. Nanta musical is one class act. 
Cheap place to shop for souvenirs!,"Great place to visit and splurge your money on souvenirs! But must be great in negotiating skills hahaha. Also lots of street food. The place is literally next to the subway station. Safe for female solo travelers. Be careful though, you might overspend your budget because of the cheap prices and fancy souvenirs available here. I spent a good 2 hours here. Food, cosmetics, clothings, and kitchenware are the most common stuff you can have here. Definitely a worthwhile stop when in Seoul, Korea."
Very lively at night. A fun way to end the day.,"Lots of food and shops. Very fun to walk around after a long day. Lots of tourist so food prices are like for tourists too but they are all good,"
The best ever 💕💕,All the food is so good and the shopping was super super nice .. myeongdong street is a MUST .. when I went Korea everything was on sale and serious I spent a lot of money cause all the clothes are very nice and comfortable .. 
Very interesting..!!!,"1) very nice food to try!! But not all of them are nice..but most of them are so good!! Its expensive than other street food but its worth it if u stay nearby myeondong street. 2) nice vibes to hang out for youngsters at night3) theres also halal food available4) clean street.. please throw your rubbish at the food stall where u bought the food and dont litter it on the street. Every stall has their plastic for leftovers and rubbish. 5) there was people wearing red clothes with hat that says information for anyone who needs help with directions so dont worry much if u are lost 6) so much beauty products for u to try with good price and discounts. Skin care and body care, face , foot mask so much cheaper here..!!!7) reach this place by train and bus. "
A street with wide variety of dining options ,"For first timers, Myeongdong is a relatively big shopping street with wide variety of dining options and comestic shops.Street food in Myeongdong is slightly expensive but tasty."
Interesting street and much cheaper,"There're so many attractive shops. And they provide customer with cheaper price than Japanese counterparts. When you are tired of shopping, you can take a rest at a caffe shop. There are also many fascinating caffe shops."
Crowded and lots of shopping ,"If you like makeup and beauty products this is the place to go. They sell so much of it here. Even if your not a fan, check it out for the atmosphere. At night, street food is also available. "
Shopping paradise,"Myeongdong is without a doubt the paradise for shopping lovers. Hardly could you find the difference between day time and night time here as this place is full of people all day long. There're numerous cosmetics, fashion, restaurants in the area, from budget to high-end. You surely can find the suitable ones with your budget.You can't immagine how fast time flies when you're in Myeongdong. You might think you spend 15' in each store, but actually you will end up with leaving it 1 hour later haha. The thing I like the best when shopping in Korea is that shops are very generous in giving customers samples and gifts. Uggghhhh greatttt!And don't forget to tried street food. So yummy. And buying strawberry too. Strawberry are extremely delicious and much cheaper compared with those in Japan (price might differ according to buyers and how big the fruit is)."
Fashion and street food,"A nice walking street market with lots of cloths and cosmetics. Face masks are everywhere and people are buying in bulk.What caught my interest are food stalls(50-60 in total the day I went there). I recommend grilled lobster with cheese. (15,000 krw)Catching taxi on the way back to hotel late at night is a bit of a problem because the taxis refuse to use the meter and charge 3x normal rate."
Must Visit when in Seoul,"Great food selection. Shopping! Shopping! Shopping! Visit the visitor's information center so you won't miss a thing. My niece enjoyed her time at the Dog Cafe. Since you will be seeing the same stores almost every 2 blocks, you might want to plan what to buy in each store so you can get tax refund (30,000 W single receipt purchase). If you don't want to line up for the refund at the airport (took my sister less than 5 minutes to do though), you also might want to ask if they deduct refund right away before you buy. Some of the food stalls start closing around 11 pm. "
Myeongdong,Lively. Diverse. Crowded. Lovely street food. Excellent Korean shops. Interesting clothes & shoes to buy at reasonable prices.
"If you liked to get hustled, stuck and waste tons of time, this is the place to be.","I must tell everyone that Myeongdong is marketed as a place with vibrant cultural experience and whatever, but most people from Seoul and who live here will never go to this area more than once a year. The reason im demoting this place is because the whole area overcharges tourists and visitors with ridiculous products that you can literally buy much cheaper anywhere. The streetfood is filthy and I am dead serious as there is barely any health concerns for most of these stalls, I have never seen these vendors never clean their pans in between intervals. They are seriously a health hazard, Myeongdong is over-rated as all the resturaunts are subpar franchises or franchise-wannabes branding themselves as authentic traditional food but they are prepackaged food that are usually reheated in stone pots or microwaves.. Just a ridiculous neighborhood. There are so many better places people should be heading to, rather than this ridiculous trap. Try your luck at GwangJang Market, Mu Gyo Dong, Suh Chon and GyeongRiDan Road, better food and a more friendly vibe for family and couples."
Great Shopping streets,"I would say Myeongdong is the best shopping place in Seoul, or even in South Korea. There are so many shops especially skin care and cosmetics. Line Store is very interesting. Clean public bathroom is available at the subway station."
If you are a tourist...it's a must experience,"I have to say it's always interesting to come to Myeongdong. It's always changing. Most visitors are tourists but locals come here too. You can find most of the shops and stores in Myeongdong in other malls or areas in the city. But the experience of shopping outside with street food and merchant vendors make this area an interesting place to come. I recommend coming here at night time with some appetite and roam the alleys and try various foods. Bring cash (Korean won) to make things more easier. You will easily get full trying many types of foods. The food vendors are general clean and nothing crazy or weird food. Also there's many restaurants as well but too many to pick from! Finding a public restroom could be difficult but if you go into large shopping centers or coffee shops, you will be fine. It's family friendly but it gets crowded. I would say myeondong is more for shopping at known brands such as makeups and shoes while dongnaemun is more for local merchants and clothes. There's definitely a different feel. I think you can give yourself about 1-2 hours to go through myeondong streets/alleys. "
Great night street food market,"This is a very busy shopping strret ' filled with all the local and other internationa brands but the main attraction is the night market, so many food stands offering such a huge variety of Korean strret food - lots of fun !"
Great place to shop,You can buy pretty much anything here. Gets very busy though as you could expect. Like orchard road Singapore or Oxford Street London.
"If you like crowd, this is the place","I must warn that I am biased in this review because i simply do not like crowded area and this place is super crowded. To add to the crowdedness, we were all wearing winter clothings. So imagine the squeezing and pushing. If you don't mind all that then it is a great place to find street food. Lot of them! All nice and cheap. "
Shopping heaven,"Dont get lost here, got many fashion clothes, beauty product ,eating streets food at all reasonable prices, i lost here around Rm300 one day shopping here at my 3rd days when i was stay at korea about a month.,nice places"
Not my favorite area in Seoul,"I guess people would have varying views but I personally don't find Myeong dong all that great. It's usually crowded with people (mostly young tourists) especially on weekends. Shops are mostly just franchises which you can find anywhere else. There are many street food stalls which you might find interesting at first but again, not my kind of thing. 늘 사람이 붐비고 길거리 음식 부스 때문에 조금 지저분한 느낌의 거리들이 많습니다. 젊은 외국인들은 흥미로울지 모르나 제 취향과는 별로맞지 않네요. "
Shopping,Excellent place to shop and eat! You can find make-up store all over Myeongdong and most of the staffs can speak in English Chinese and/or Japanese.. 
Attractingly crazy ....,"Anything you want , anything you think you can imagine , its on the streets. Because we were here winter time , can you imagine coats , scarves , gloves , shoes, cardigans on sale in the streets ??? oh ! and dont forget to try the street food ,1. stir fry beef with monggo sprouts , 2. Scallops with melted cheese ( super yummy) and 3. Fish andSweet Potato paste / cake....4. theres even lobster..."
"""shopping haven""",""" this place is really a must palce to visit, my family really enjoyed looking for great bargains, especially my daughter she bought a lot of cd's & we bought a lot of beauty products not just for us but for our friends & relativers as well."
Cosmetic shops! ,"I love the street! The food street and the cosmetic shops! 4 times when there in 2 weeks. But it also not enough for me since I'm a makeup lover LOL! Body shops nature republic, thefaceshop, april skin, iope, anything is here! Dont forget to try the food street along the street and also the ice cream."
shopping paradise,"you can find everything in Myeongdong which is including trendy fashion,cloths,jewelry,shoes,skincare,delicious foods"
The Best Shopping,"Myeongdong is a huge shopping district, you can littearlly spend an entire day there. There are tons of shops, resturants and bars. If you go at night everything is bright and lite up, it's quite a sight if night life is your thing. I gets a bit crowded at night, so if your not into big crowds definitely visit during the day. At night the food vendors set up and you can eat some really good street food while you walk around. This is one of my favorite hangout spots in Seoul."
Literally can buy every cosmetic-related products,"You can literally find almost all well-known cosmetic shops here in Myeongdong. There's like 2-3 branches of the same brand in every different corner of myeongdong. The promoters and workers here speak different languages, especially Chinese and Japanese. There will be a lot of Chinese here as the Chinese Embassy is at one of the streets in Myeongdong (not sure if this was related though.) But anyway, you can find better ""currency exchange shop"" here with better price. I'm not sure about other currency but I know China RMB and Hong Kong dollar have good prices here. So, check it out yourselves :) And, there's lot of good restaurants and of course STREET FOOD. "
New Years weekend,"Fun area to walk around in Seoul. Lots of street food and shopping. Visited twice during the week. Would recommend the Nutella crepe, my kids loved it- ""best they've ever had"". "
Myeongdong was the highlight of my trip to Seoul ,"Without a doubt myeongdong was the best part of my trip to South Korea. The market seems to go on forever.. the real fun is tasting all the street foods. An array of fried halloumi, street fruits and pancake type delicacies awaits you.. they also had amazing foot long soft serve ice cream. The shopping for gifts and souvenirs was amazing but be prepared to bargain a little for the best price. It's a must stop and see place if your in Seoul- but do go at night as the selection of street food is wider. "
Great place to shop for make up,well my title says it all. If you want to shop for make up you should go here. THere is a lot of food stall too. 
Street sellers and department stores,"This place is amazing. Many department stores and a lot of street sellers, where you can buy goods and food. At the end of the street there is the myeong-dong Catholic Cathedral, which is a historical marc of redemocratization of Korea in the 1980s."
Worth a visit ,"Spend time wandering around the markets, you will find there are lots of branded stores with unique architech. Lots of street food along the way. A busy market. Some shops have their staffs standing outside persuading you to walk in to their shops however be careful I myself experienced being pull in! But there are many shops for everyone to browse. "
Shops everywhere ,This is a typical shopping centre. There are lots of the flagship shops here and multiple versions of the same brand. I got disorientated as to which street I was on. Korea is big on skin care and there appeared to be a third of the shops were skincare. There are also street stalls and street entertainers. 
best shopping,shopping down town was so clean and safe. You could find so many people speaking English. The people could not do enough for you
The world famous street - slighly over hyped,The shopping area is really busy and there is plenty of things to shop and eat. Rather pricey especially for cosmetics but you can get tax free done right inside the shops.
Shopping and street food,This is a very lively shopping streets filled with shops selling clothes and cosmetics.It is a very lively and vibrant area as it is filed with busy shoppers.The street became extremely busy after 1pm as many of the street food vendors starting selling food too.
Crowded,Many foods n shop very crowded. U can shopping there n eat many street food very delicious open until midnight.
Cosmetics galore,"My wife loved this place. Every shop Vick g away a free sample at the front and so many discounts. I followed her in only to get the second free sample so she had 2. She bought a lot of stuff, things I don't understand.This place is Heaven for girls.There's about 6 of each shop (nature republic, etude house etc). "
Skincare/Cosmetics Heaven + Tips for Shopping,"FOODThe street food stalls are pricier compared to Namdaemun Market or Ewha e.g. egg bread was twice the price in Ewha? SHOPPING TIPS1. Don't rush to buy products. Take the time to walk around and compare prices first. For example, Mamonde is a brand under Amore Pacific, and Aritaum is the main store that sells more prominent Amore Pacific brands (so one might think products there will be cheaper). However, while I was there, Olive Young was selling my Mamonde toner at 17 500 won, much cheaper than the 25 000 won at Aritaum. 2. Tax free is a minimum of 30 000 won, so try to collate all your purchases and buy them from the same store so you can hit this minimum. E.g. If you're only going to buy one Laneige lipstick (~23k-25k won), it's easier to get tax free by buying it from an Aritaum store where they carry several other brands you may wish to buy products from (and therefore hit 30k) compared to buying it from the Laneige flagship store.3. Myeongdong has several outlets of the same brand e.g. lots of Innisfrees, Tony Molys etc. However, NOT ALL OUTLETS GIVE IMMEDIATE TAX REFUNDS. Check if the store gives immediate tax refunds first before buying. This means less hassle since you won't need to dedicate time to claiming tax refunds at the airport. 4. The more you buy from a store, the more freebies you get! So it's better to have one MASSIVE buy at one time from a store than to go back multiple times. 5. The salespeople will tell you that a particular product is very popular. EVERY PRODUCT IS POPULAR IN KOREA. Do your research first, or you may end up spending more than you intend to. (And if you do indeed become an unsuspecting victim, the moneychangers with better rates are those opposite the Chinese embassy in Myeongdong :P)6. Most outlets will have salespeople pushing their new releases. If you're tempted and are willing to purchase, DON'T GIVE IN/SHOW THAT YOU ARE KEEN TOO EASILY. What I've found is that the harder the salespeople have to work to convince you, the more willing they are to give you freebies. E.g. When I was at The Saem, after 10-15 minutes of extolling the benefits of their Wrinkle Plumper, the saleslady was offering me 2 deep foaming cleansers, a packet of masks and makeup products ""and you only need to buy 2 plumpers!""."
Shopaholic's Oasis,There are many shops and street food stalls at this street. Come by around 6pm where the street vendors start to cook up their delicacy. The shops at this street are also places to look foward to find branded clothing or beauty products
Korean cosmetics haven,"If you love Korean cosmetics, this is where your bliss is. Street after street of korean cosmetic stores are located here interpersed with clothing, shoes, bling, and tourist take-homes. Restaurants also abound in the upper floors of the cosmetic shops. Its pretty crowded but the yummy street food in the evenings are worth braving the crowd. There is a food stall selling japchae almost right at the entrance of Myeongdong at the Lotte side. Its usually the one first to close because its japchae sells out really fast. Look for it and the guy who can make your japchae with our without meat. Mine was purr veggies for 3000 won. 4000 won if with meat. We stayed 3 nights in a hotel right in Myeongdong near the Myeongdong Cathedral and I tasted almost all of the street food carts there. Some are so-so, others were worth one repeat while the japchae was worth going back for 3 straight nights. So "
Cosmetics and food galore,This place is made for women!!! Cosmetics everywhere!!! Be sure to ask for free samples!!! Nice to walk around also during the late afternoon when all the food carts are set up... Nice to try different street foods!
Honeymoon @ Myeong Dong Street,"We wanted to go to Myeong Dong Street but not sure how to travel to this place.We just walked along a subway shopping and exit. Suddenly, we are at Myeong Dong Street. It's somehow so magical.Food along this street seems expensive. We tried the cabbage omelette, which cost around KW$5000. It does not taste nice.A very good walk along this street and observe the night activities and scene.Shops close at about 11pm. Adidas closes at 10pm. "
Myeongdong ,This is a most popular shopping area in Seoul. You could found all the cosmetic items with 100 sq. Meter. and 2 duty fee shop nearby. But the only problem is too many peoples. It was Crazy!
You can find anything here!,"this place is always packed with people, definitely a must visit for shopping from cosmetics, fashion, and also kpop cds (buy it at myeongdong underground shopping mall for cheaper price). there is also lots of street food at night, eventhough it's more pricy compared to street food at other places."
Shopping and more shopping,Well probably the best shopping area in Korea! Anything that is fashion and cosmetic related this is the place to go by far! Don't read this go and shop!
Always stay here,"I used to stay in Myeongdong when i have business trip in Korea, because you can find so many local foods and all fashioned goods here."
Everything you need,"A convenient one-stop shop. Anything you need they'll probably have it if you look hard enough. There's a cat cafe in the middle of the streets (worth it trust me) and a lot of street food!! My favourite is by far the grilled lobster, half of a lobster was 10000won and the sauce has a whole lot of goodies in it so definitely worth a try. Needless to say, if you're a make up addict you might go broke. Be sure to check out different branches for different promotions because I swear there are 50 etudehouses within a 20m radius. I also find that you have to ask for samples nowadays because they don't give them out by the handful anymore. Overall a great experience :) "
A Shopping Paradise,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a must visit in Seoul. Look out for Line Store with their HUGE Bear mascot welcoming you at the entrance and you are free to take as many photographs you want inside the store.There are dozens and dozens of shops selling skin care products and you are spoilt for choices. As for international clothing brands I highly recommend the Zara Myeongdong Store that gives good discounts during their sales and they have an extensive range for both sexes.There are many lanes and alleys that might put you in maze and for a while you find yourself lost in Myeongdong. So, best to remember a landmark so you can make your way back.If you see people distributing free goodies bag do grap one and besides free samples inside you might be lucky to find vouchers in exchange for free bags at Shinsegae department store and also vouchers to purchase Arex train ticket from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport at a discounted price."
must visit the cathedral too,you must visit the cathedral there. a set of quiet and peaceful catholic buidings in a busy district with rich history and culture.
Very crowded but a fun experience,"This area is a shopping area that is famous for its cosmetic/skin care brand stores, clothing stores, restaurants, and not-to-be-missed street food. The place is crowded most days, but it is one place you will want to experience. Expect to be bumped into a lot by people from all over the world, but dont let it bother you. Where else in Seoul will you be able to say you rubbed shoulders with people from China, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, England, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United States, France, Australia, and Africa, all within a matter of minutes. Also be prepared to be pulled into the different skin care stores by enthusiastic sales girls working on commission. Not to worry though, stay here very long and you will leave with a large haul of free skin care samples given to you by these girls. Also, while you're here you might want to consider looking to taking in an afternoon showing of NANTA- The Cooking Show, an entertaining off-broadway style singing, dancing, comedy stage show that is a delight to behold and not hindered by language barriers. Tickets are sold at the NANTA Theater and go quickly, so plan ahead."
Shopping ,"If you love to make up yourself, there is so many things you can buy here. From top to toe, they're had it all. All the best brand you've ever heard."
Heart of Seoul,"Between two great subway stations lies the greatest shopping district in Seoul. With a wide range of shopping categories, one day is simply not enough to explore the whole shopping district. And at night, life brightens up with food stalls at every street. Although the average food item would cost 3000won, its an experience you cannot miss.There are also 'tourist helpers' who may speak multi-languages who are walking around at cross-streets which is very helpful especially if you get lost.Ps. for all those cosmetics lovers and freebies lovers, look out for staff members waving cosmetics around."
"Shop, eat, shop","What is visiting Seoul without a sport of shopping??? If you are traveling to other places in Korea, I'd suggest making Seoul your last stop to save some huge luvvage lugging. Unless its something that is native (i don't know if thts the right word to use, pardon me if it's wrong..!) Or if you happen to be at O'Sulloc Jeju, save all the shopping for Myeongdong! I swear I thought I'd never see the end if the malls, fashion and cosmetics outlets.. The street is busy so come prepared for it. Comfy shoes and easy to remove apparels are essential if you intend to buy clothes.. You don't wanna be the cause of a dressing room line nw.. There are plenty of street stalls selling really cheap stuff but they tend to be pretty generic after a while and the streets can get a lil confusing after a few turns if you don't read Korean so if you see somethi g you want, buy it! If you've missed it already, dont worry coz it'll likely pop up further down the street! Food options are great here.. We had awesome, awesome grilled beef at one of the upstairs restaurant.. Like literally melts in your mouth kinda meat.. Which we unfortunately finished before we could do the picture snapping thing (yes..it was THAT GOOD..)but it wasn't cheap..like abt sgd$100 for 2 pax w/ additional soup n soju? But it was the best beef we've had the entire trip i swear. If you'd like cheaper options, keep a look out for the restaurants in the alleys..! They serve pretty gd food at reasonable prices. Once you've eaten your fill, theres always the option of walking those calories off checking out SPAO! We spent like 2hrs in SPAO coz there's soo much to see and try on..if my wallet could speak, it would be crying in pain.. If clothes ain't the right season, go check out Olive and Young. Its kinda like a Korean wonder-drugstore where you see shelves and shelves of products you've never even heard of but can't wait to try..! I got my Dr Jart masks and Whamisa stuff here..! Sorry guys.. No pictures of the said street coz 1. The fingers were too frozen and 2. Hands were too busy trying stuff.. :D "
Make up skin care freebies,"The entire street is littered with make up shops. From afternoon onwards, vehicles are not allowed. Food stalls sprung up all along the centre of the street. You can get your fill of Korean make up and skin care products and street food. All the shops are trying to outdo each other by giving away free samples, face masks, etc to entice any customers to walk into the shops. It's very lively. "
The main shopping area of Seoul and always bustling with life,"All the best shops and always full of life. Big Uniqlo, Zara, Skinfood etc and cafes and street food non stop. Always fun to walk through and see, smell and taste all the different and often fun decorated snacks from the local cuisine. "
Great shopping!! ,"We had a blast shopping, the place is huge- easy to get lost!!! Lots of good deals, great street food "
shopping shopping shopping,it's like a 24 hour non-stop shopping center but abundant of street food stalls at night some serving lobster tail at $15.00 each. plenty of Korean make up and clothing stores.
This place comes alive on Saturdays,"Head down on a Saturday and go hungry. There are so many street stalls selling so many different dishes and nibbles that you are bound to find something you like. Don't like street food, not a problem there are just as many restaurants vying for your trade that you are just spoilt for chose. I passed by once and then went back a few times."
shopping heaven for skincare lover,This place is a shopping heaven for girls or anyone. You can spend a whole day here. I recommend bringing some kind of luggage or bags with wheels because you will buy a lot and carrying your bags around all day can be tiring. 
Nice and good area to walk around and shop,A nice area to walk around to look and if you want to buy things as gift or as souvenirs. Take your time to walk around there
awesome street food!,a lot of food u can try! not so expensive! they sell clothes also..try bargain as much as u can..very friendly seller.
Repetitive shops,"The area is pretty big with lots of shops and places to eat. Quite a lot of western options, which is a big thing for me living in china, but not do much if you are just on holiday. You'll find H&M, forever 21, Lush. And food places like Krispy Kreme, McDonald's etc. I have never seen this many cosmetics shops, ever!! Though the shops and products are all the same and really repetitive. Worth a see but only for an hour or 2."
Great stroll thru the neighbourhood,"Great place ro spend an evening, people watch, shop and try the variety of street food. Very lively and crowded but a place to experience. Try the ice cream in the fish shapped waffle with honeycomb. Delicious"
Great place for shopping and eating,"Great place for shopping and eating. I ate a delicious ox head soup in small restaurant. There are lot of people also. Lot of see, quite cheap food. I recommend to at least visit there once."
A place I go to during every visit in Seoul,"This place is perfect for those who are into skincare and makeup products. Lots of different brands can be found here, you'll definitely go crazy at the plentiful choices available! Besides that, there are lots of great street food that you can try as well aside from the usual restaurants etc. It gets livelier at night (and more crowded), it's best to experience Myeongdong during the day and night to get a feel f both settings. Definitely a must go to place when you're in Seoul :)"
good place for eat street,i've been there in 21 januari 2017... the things is at night Myeongdong are crowded place.. but its fine you can find many diffrents kind of foods... many restaurants and eat street..ooh and you can find many kind of departement shops too... this place is very enjoyble when you at Myeongdong
More for ladies who like to shop,I stayed here for 4 days. Not really for me. I'm a guy and I'm not into shopping. The shops and restaurants here were fairly repetitive. Not many attractions here to see.
Mecca for Shopping and Makeup,"#1 Place to go for makeup and skincare supplies, shopping, local eats, coffee shops, and more. There is also the famous Myeongdong Cathedral which is worth a visit. Ask the Tourist Helpers in red for a map and directions and they will point you in the right direction whatever you are looking for. "
Always brimming with excitement,I went there at least 4 times during my week stay in Seoul. I went at all times of the day and must say that it was the most exciting at night when the street vendors pedalling food and other items for sale emerge. This place is always bustling with activity and there's always something for everyone.
"Myeondong (S Korea) vs Ladies market (Hong Kong), A comparison can help first time traveler","The purpose to have comparison is to make possible any re do may be skipped, especially when a traveler trapped in the temptation to go to every similar shopping area they/she can......well..I'm not trying to lead not to go to L M.....Look... every ambience of each spot, if we are talking about street shopping experience, you can actually draw a comparison line in consideration based on your main reason1. First time experience ?2. For fun only ?3. Being a solidarity person, because your friend wanna go  there ?4. Repetition ?5. Or truly/genuinely a street shopper, and you love it anyhowIn any case Myeondong win for its neat,cleanliness,more decent and especially the attitude of trader, shop keeper slightly less rude, even in fact most sellers are Chinese, but however they are nicer (although not all)I would prefer to hang out longer in Myeondong rather than in Ladies MarketLastly... up to you... :)Although you might find cheaper in term of price wise....less logistic cos dude...."
Excellent shopping street,You can get lots of cosmetic items along this street as there are many stores selling cosmetic items. Lots of street food as well. There are many eateries which can be found along the lanes from the main street.
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Probably was pampered by how available cosmetics and skin care products are available everywhere in Seoul. Didn't find it worth a trip. There is a Daiso at the end of the street, and the food streets are just okay compared to TW. Prices of merchandise is not attractive compared to what one can buy from Taobao."
Perfect Place to Shop and Eat!,"A street that overload with shopping retails and great street food! I will start to become crowded from 6pm onwards. Selling from the range of branded items to non branded, everything i can find here. I bought very nice puma sneaker at FOLDER, a concept shop with variety of sneakers and sport shoes. and also you can expect to find a lot of cosmetic shops along the street as myeongdong is mainly famous on cosmetic outlets. Street food also delicious! I've tried a few stall and what i can say is, they are selling a really great food! Even during Seollal celebration, this place is open and crowded while other place like namdaemun market and dongdaemun are all closed. "
"Busy street, yummy food and shopping galore","Been here a number of times already, but I still did not get bored of this busy street every night. It's a cosmetic and shopping heaven for my partner and the number of delicious street food adds to the fun. However, take note that not everything sold here is cheap, especially for those cart shops, some of the stuff like glove scarfs etc, I have found same one for cheaper price elsewhere.There is also many good restaurant around here that is mentioned by many food blog, do your research and make sure to visit them!"
Cosmetic supplies and street food galore!,"If you need to stock up on your face cream, cleanser, cosmetics paraphernalia...look no further, visit Myeongdong.To energize you while you shop, there are loads of street stalls offering the best of Korean street food...from the traditional toppoki to the whimsical spiral cut potatoes on a stick.Great place to shop for fashion items but could get a bit crowded with tourists during weekends or holiday season."
Cosmetics Heaven,"If you love shopping for Korea brands cosmetics, this is a place you should never skip. Don't worry if you regret not buying stuff from the first brand A shop, there're more brand A shop at Myeongdong. Easily there are at least 3 ""The Face Shop"", ""Innis Free"" etc. There's quite a variety of street food and cafes if you're a non-shopper. At least a reason to be at Myeongdong."
Lots of repeated stores,"Definitely a street to check out. Lots of cosmetic stores and they tend to repeat after you walk 500m or so. They have street food starting around 4pm daily, again, they tend to repeat as you go further down the street. Prices here for food are inflated. "
shopping haven,"We have no itinerary for the day, we just ket on walking and walking until we reach this streetLots of shops, dining area, street foodsIt's worth a visit."
Shopping heaven!,"This place has been on my mind ever since I left! If you're like me and love make-up, skincare, food, clothes. JUST EVERYTHING. Then this strip is just for you! The food stalls don't come out til 4-5PM so I suggest either ditch dinner plans & just try everything (which I did on many occasions!) huge variety of different types of food! This strip is makeup/skincare heaveeeeeeeen! So many stores, with so many unique & popular products! Also with plenty of samples! Don't forget to ask for your samples! All the store-workers are happy to help even though there might be a slight language barrier. Literally went here at least once a day!"
"Street food, cosmetics & skincare products galore ",You can find all the famed korean street food here. I initially thought that all korean skincare and cosmetic brands would hv at least one shop here but I was mistaken. There are only about 10 brands which had many outlets within one stone's throw. Atmosphere was awesome though and you'd be surprised to find that the cafés here are deserted and practically empty even on weekends. The line friend's cafe is an exception though
Always worth a visit,"As expected, a visit to myeongdong doesnt disappoint. Whether you go there for shopping or for food tripping, you will always leave the place satisfied and wanting to come back. The streets are lined with shops filled with cosmetics, clothes, bags, etc. And then there are those food carts that sell everything from potato twists to scallops to lobsters to ice cream at a very reasonable price. Go with an empty stomach to make it worth your while. "
must go for make up junkies,many cosmetic stores around with special offer or discounts..cheap tho..there are many food streets stalls..ready to get loaded! very crowded and popular among tourist
Amazing Culture,"My fiancé and I accidentally stumbled into this area, not really knowing where we were going. We read about it on TripAdvisor, but just didn't realize where we were when we got there. The street food was absolutely fantastic, streets were so clean, friendly people, LOTS of shops and plenty of dining/ drinking. Great to visit! "
heaven for make up addict,"It's literally the heaven for make up addict! Tons of free samples. Just by walking around for 2 hours I got lots of samples. And when you buy, you can get more samples! Best thing, when you buy there they can give you discount plus extra product with much cheaper price than its regular price!"
Seoul's Shopping Mecca,"If you want to have that korean glow and flawless skin, then this is the place where you can buy those skin care/beauty products. The food here is also a must try. The shoes here are cheaper than those in HK. "
Busy shopping area with some bargains,"This is a crowded but pleasant area to shop for clothing, shoes, skincare & beauty products, Korean souvenirs, and more. Remember to look up while you are walking along the streets. There are innumerable shops and vendors to see, and not all are on the street level!"
Shopping street with plenty of street food. Quite pricey abc repetitive. ,"We just went for a short while for the ""been there done that"" factor. We were mostly interested in the street foods which we read so much about. The streets are lined with mostly cosmetic & clothing shops. There are also restaurants around which are mostly long Q because it's a touristy zone. Prices aren't cheap either. You can get similar food elsewhere for cheaper. The street food are quite repetitive in each lane. Grilled seafood sticks, fried chicken pieces, crepes, buns, noodles etc, then repeat. Things aren't cheap. From ₩2000 upwards. And not really wow taste. We tried quite a few stalls and only the fresh strawberry mochi was wow but expensive ₩2500 each. We didn't shop much, just a face cleanser for my brother. There's tax refunds available from some shops for tourists with passports so bring it if you want to shop. "
A MUST SEE,"Everything you'd want to see, taste or smell is here! I bought sterling silver jewelry in a small and unique shop where the gift-wrapping was too beautiful to open when I got home! Candy hawkers made us laugh with their silly songs and the little restaurant that served bimbimbap opened up a new world of flavors and tastes to us - 2 adventurous Americans who made it through a wonderful day on the street market!"
Giving it a five stars because my wife said so. ,"Took my wife here and it was paradise for her. Stores after stores loaded full of cosmetics and more cosmetics. Everything is buy one get one free to lure you inside. If you're a male then prepare to feel lame. It helped that there are food venders all over so at least I had something to do. Should be renamed to ""women only cosmetics street"". "
Heaven for makeup lover,I believe most people who look up for seoul will ended up going here especially girls this is really heaven for us!If you buying makeup buying together with other friends so you can get more sample and tax refundAnd dont forget to list what you wanted to buy if not you will get lost here 
Shopping Paradise,An area pack with shops and restaurants. Lots of great Korean restuarants in this area and you can also find many food carts if you would like to try out Korean street food. Many fashion and beauty stores in this area.
Skincare Haven!,"If you love skincare, you definitely need to drop bu Myeongdong! Various Korean skincare brands are here so choose what you like first before going on with your purchase. There are also a lot of street food here so make sure to try those too! I loved the chocolate covered strawberry mochi. "
Street Food Heaven!,"Complete selection of Korean street food can be found in here. In addition, you can also shop for various kind of goods. But for myself, the street food is the main attraction! My personal favorite is the Jjajangmyeon & Cheese Scallops. "
Love the street food at night,"Various kind of food in the street at night, good price. My whole family enjoyed a lot there. Deep fried crab was our favourite"
Skincare Heaven! ,"We were really looking forward towards Myeongdong and it's endless supply of skincare shops. We were not disappointed in this sense. These skincare shops were everywhere, and they also had many of the same branded shops on different roads. They also do give free sample by the door to entice you into the shop, sometimes it's hard to not 'buy' because there are just too many good skincare products! And yes, they do give more free gifts as well after purchasing. The good thing was that most of the skincare products were decently priced and of course remember to bring your passport! I found that most of the shops deducted the 'tax refund' amount off your receipt right away, you just gotta spend at least 30,000 Korean Won. If you don't speak Korean, I found that more people could speak mandarin instead of English. There are also clothing shops like SPAO, 8, UNIQLO and etc.; shoe shops; LINE shop (which has cute LINE merchandise). Also, street food is all over Myeongdong, however, more stalls do come out during the weekend. However, cars do tend to come into the shopping street and it can get a bit dangerous as the street is crowded with people; and there aren't many bins around for your trash. "
Paradise for shopaholics.,"Love the vibes.No matter how many times I'd visited this places, I never get bored.It's just like your feet walked automatically to this place whenever you visit Seoul.Lots of stores for us to shop, lots of cafes, street food stalls and restaurants for us to savor, and lots of sudden events to see in this place :)Good place for friends' hangout!Even while I was writing this review, I miss this place!"
Unforgettable experience,"Everything is great...sounds, smells, people, noise... The food is cooked in front of you and at Meyon Dong I took the best orange juice of my life."
Shopping heaven!,"If you LOVE shopping, then you can never leave Seoul without visiting Myeongdong. I have been visiting since I was a kid and every time I come here, it has something new! Back in the 90's, it was all locals and I would often come here with my siblings and cousins during our summer breaks. We would always go shopping and eat street food when we got hungry. This was where all the youngsters would go shopping and hang out with their friends. I am surprised by how different it is now compared to the good old days. Years ago, it used to be all the Japanese tourists shopping for cosmetics and the sales representatives were Korean that spoke Japanese. Now, most of the tourists are Chinese and the sale representatives are also Chinese but they are multilingual. (They can speak Mandarin, Japanese and Korean.) If you can speak Mandarin or Japanese, you will be able to communicate with them since they are not fluent in English. A lot of the signs are in Japanese and Chinese so it is easy to navigate around and there are also street guides that can help you if you have questions. The streets are filled with tourists and you'll see the long lines in every cosmetic store. If you go during holiday season, popular cosmetic items are sold out so don't expect to buy everything off your wish list. :( If there's something you REALLY want, try visiting a store that is NOT in Myeongdong. If you get hungry, you will never starve because there are food carts everywhere (only in evenings) and endless restaurants on every corner of the shopping street. Just be careful where you go because most of the places are targeted for tourists so gets expensive and not as good. If you don't like being stomped by tourists, avoid going on holidays and in the evening. I would prefer to visit in the morning so you can shop in peace and not get pushed around by people. Do some power shopping and get out of there around lunch time because that's when it starts to get packed. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to do some crazy shopping! :)"
Very vibrant,"I went here a couple of times in mid-January late evenings, when the temperature was below 0. Was pleasantly surprised to see the crowd and energy around. Absolutely loved the vibe. Some shops are pricey but you could find good deals if you explore.Loved the street food too."
"Vibrant place, but pricey","For first-timers in Seoul, this area is such a fascinating picture of what the city offers. On our first day, we went straight here to experience the street food, and check out the shops. After a few days exploring Seoul though, we've seen Hongdae, Dongdaemun, and Ewha Shopping street, and we realized just how expensive it is in Myeongdong Shopping Street. The skin care shops and clothes outlets are okay, since they have the same prices across the board. The street food and clothes sold in stalls, however, are expensive. You can get cheaper street food in Hongdae. "
The famous shopping street in Seoul,"Various makeup brands, clothing line, and restaurants are located here. Some stores allow additional discounts for foreigners. Street foods are all over the place, just everything starts from KRW3000, though, higher compared to other parts of Seoul like Jongno or Yeongdeungpo (where we also got to try street foods). If you're up for branded items, this place is good, but if you're not much into it, Namdaemun Market might be a better place to shop, though does not look quite as much modern as Myeongdong."
"21st Century ""in your face"" culture and shopping.","Myeongdong is an amazing experience that morphs and changes as the hours pass. After 5pm, out of nowhere, emerge street vendors, food carts in the middle of these tiny lane ways. Unbelievably, cars and trucks still meander through the chaos at all hours, so be careful! It was like the vampires emerged from the dark, but these people were NOT vampires, they were gorgeous, beautiful, well dressed and groomed, young people, out to have fun!Coming from Melbourne Australia, where are city lane ways and alleys are famous for their art, food, culture and atmosphere, we thought we would be prepared for the Myeongdong experience. How wrong we were.As the sun set, literally thousands of hip, cool, well-dressed and well endowed, young ones converged from goodness knows where, into the streets and filled it with a buzz and almost electric excitement. It felt like a carnival or street fair, only this happens every night! Enhancing this cracking atmosphere are the street spruikers and touters - lots of people offering 2 for 1 deals and other tempting offers. It seemed as if there are more than 200 shops, selling different potions of face cream, whiteners and promises of youth and eradication of wrinkles. If you ask me, I am yet to see or find a Korean woman's wrinkle!The shops are amazing! They are not cheap but here one has the opportunity to buy genuine, high end brands and good quality items. The shop assistants all ignored me as I guess, a roly-poly, over 50, baby boomer is NOT their target market. We just walked around over 4 nights and I don't think we scratched the surface. Every night, thousands of young, beautiful people massed together to shop, eat, have fun and soak up the incredible atmosphere. We had more fun, ""people watching"" than shopping.There are all the major multi-national retailers like Zara, H&M, Daiso, MCM and the Uniqlo shop claims to be the biggest in Korea etc.Don't expect a lot of English to be spoken and most of the clothes cater to the smaller Asian sizes. Likewise with shoes.Every night was a different experience and a blast. Western people will have a wry smile as foods such as Nutella & banana crepes are considered ""premium"" and priced at the very top end of the scale, whereas to us, this sort of food is no big deal (we have to watch calories, fats, questionable palm oil additives etc. issues that don't even seem to be on the radar in Seoul) It is much better to do as the locals and we learned to love kimchi (fermented cabbage and radish) which is served with EVERY meal.Do yourself a favour and book a tourist, kimchi school lesson, in order to learn how to prepare it and spice it to one's liking.Our stomachs went through a revolution with fermented food and Korean cuisine.Myeongdong is amazing and we absolutely loved it, although it really is more suited to the hipster, under 30, high earning young ones or at least those who are young at heart ;-)The area is extremely well serviced by public transport [subway], buses and moderately priced taxis. No Uber available yet.We soaked up the atmosphere of Myeongdong, dined, wined and walked till we were exhausted and could not go further.This area showcases the success, hard work and achievements of the young, well-educated Korean society, trying to balance tradition and culture with modern technology and progress.Amazing!"
Fun place with an unique layout,"Walked to Myeongdong Shopping Street from the hotel we were staying one day looking for something specific, this place is really unique in its layout, there are maybe a dozen makeup/skin care shops in the area that has multiple stores each around another corner, they sell the exact same things but in case one store runs out of something you can just walk down the street and find another one of the exact same store and chances are they'll have what you are looking for, guess it's a tactic to maximize the store exposure to tourists. Most of the employees there spoke Korean and Chinese, very little English though but since I'm a native Chinese speaker I had no problem getting around. Good little fun place to just hang around."
Great place for street food hunting.,This is the place where you can find a lot of street food varieties. Lot of makeup and facial products also can be found here.However i had a bad experience here with mobile accessories seller. Bargaining is not a option here. They tend to chase you away after you make a payment.
I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE !,myeongdong street offers wide range of korean food from traditional to modern. All the food are very delicious and i consider the price very affordable. What i like the most are the busy atmosphere of the street.
"Dazzling, exciting Street Food with lots of Korean beauty products PLUS a school that would teach you Kimchi making!","An exciting destination at night when the streets are brightly lighted up and the food in the streets so yummy, from authentic vegie omelet to grilled Lobsters! Wow, they have grilled fresh Scallops, shrimps and squid, too even baby octopus...A taste of hogalbi on a stick is krw3000, chicken bbq is also krw3000. Lobsters costs around krw8000..and if you get tired of eating, go inside the Cosmetic shops and try some BB cream (Korea is where BB cream was invented) or CC cream (moisture content). They come in a lot of forms from tube to Cushion style . there you can get some facial masks.. On sale , buy 3 take 1!!..and if you still have extra time, try getting a kimchi lession along Myeondong street. they have a school there that offers Kimchi making!! you will bring home whatever you made. "
Heaven!!,"If you love beauty products, you must visit this place! There are restaurants and hotels around the area. The biggest Uniqlo is located in this area. Must visit! Make sure to visit during the day. It's crowded at night...VERY crowded!"
Great place for first time in Seoul,"Stayed in Myeungdong while in Seoul for the first time and it was excellent! Plenty of stalls for street food to try out. Although it appears cheap at first, having numerous snacks is actually more than a meal inside a restaurant!Area is typically open from 10 am to 11 pm with nowhere to buy coffee at 7 am and little selection to get snacks after 11 pm!Shops on the side streets are much cheaper than the ones on the main road. Currency exchange was pretty much wholesale rates, better than the 5% surcharge at the airport for USD cash conversion.Coffee is excellent in Seoul with pricing about 2x inside Myeungdong whereas half the price a couple blocks over. Quality is excellent either way."
Bad experience,Prices are much higher than other area in Seoul for the same product. Shopkeepers are extremely pushy and force you to try their product. Feel like it is a tourist scam. I will stay away from this district if I visit Seoul again in the future. 
Shopping and street food,"A wide variety of street food stalls to choose from, ranging from more expensive items like grilled lobster (10000 KRW for small) and grilled abalone, to affordable items like porridge, noodles, etc.The place is also filled with make up and skin care shops, it can be dizzying trying to figure out which brand and type to purchase. When I was there, all shops have 50% discount for facial masks (WOW), and according to my friends, some shops do give free samples."
"a great buzz, plenty of shopping and eating places","Walked there several times during the day and at night. Yes it is very crowded but there are many many streets and alleys to explore. So many shops and eating places to choose from including international brand stores to local Korean. A lot of fun just walking and looking at the shops, the crowds, and trying to work out the foods being sold on the street. Im sure there are other places as well but if staying near City Hall would certainly recommend this as part of the Seoul expereince"
One hectic place to be,"A place where you can buy a lot of stuffs especially facial product or make up. Some little tips, some products may be cheaper in the duty free mall but duty free mall is not as complete as this shopping street yet they still have variety of food from breakfast to supper."
The trendy streets!,"Lotsa trendy clothes and shoes here in Myeongdong! Street carts line the place after 3:30pm onwards! A great place to shope and prices are reasonable!There are loads of Chinese tourists here and dont be surprised if retailers all speaks Mandarin! Do check out the street food and the ""giant mussels"" cart!"
Fun vibrant place,"Visited here on a cold snowy Saturday evening. Great fun atmosphere lots of people, shops open until late, great street food, some items very interesting. Definitely worth a visit. If you are looking for cat cafes as one of our group was this is the place to go."
Quite crowded,"Myeongdong's a great place to go if you wanna shop for makeup and skincare all in one place. It's a nice shopping place but I personally would rather shop someplace else as this area feels so crowded, and I had been grabbed by one of the shopowners in an effort to bring me to one of the makeup shops. Some of the shops also give you free samples so that's cool. "
"Good fun, reasonable prices","A busy evening market, said to go on quite late. Useful mix of street stalls and established international and regional and Korean local shops (H&M, Zara, Giordano, etc). Quite friendly and good for locals and visitors alike."
Good for shopping,"Myeongdong really has just about everything you'd want, shopping wise. The information angels stationed at major junctions were very helpful - they speak English, Mandarin and Japanese. Funnily enough, we went back often for food - O'Sulloc tea house, BBQ galbi ribs and fried chicken."
Interesting shops,"Many brands and products exclusive to South Korea. Lots of cosmetics. Variety of food stalls, restaurants, and coffee shops."
Great place for shopping!!!,"It is great place for shopping and dinning!All kinds of brands of cosmetic and skin care, won't miss any such as Innisfree, etude house, VDL, Holika Holika, skin food etc.. Lotte duty free is also located near by. Few Supermarket open till midnight. Lots of famous dinning restaurant, Korean beef, all u can eat pork, fried chicken, coffee houses and more!If u only have limited time staying in Seoul, just go to Myeongdong shopping street!"
The street of everything and pack with things of your choice!!!,"You want to get yourself pampered with all kind of fashions, facials, trends, unusual street food (this is not the traditional type but created for tourists) and lots of variety of food (restaurants everywhere)!It was truly pack during Christmas day and tonnes of people just wanted to get out of the house and hang around here. You can see so many different type of people (I mean local and tourists)! Get some discounted items on your facial products, sports shoes of all brands (I can't find my size~Arrgh) and nearby is the Nanta Show Centre. We got to taste a good local food ~ A pot for all. It was really good and we actually cannot finish it. Top Korea Tour private guide, Juno Lee brought us there! Yeah I know I can walk there but the purpose was the show and a walkabout in Myeongdong! You won't regret walking to all the streets but avoid the small lanes. There is a Cathedral Church too! Trust me, this place has too many brands for you to choose and I was lost for a moment of time!Once you are out from the Myeongdong Street, you can see the KDrama shooting view that they have taken in some points. Find out on the latest Mermaid story. Oh yeah, things are not cheap there actually but you need to find out which to get and ask for the discount! Majority of the sales person could speak Chinese but a minor can speak basic English! Have fun rounding, shopping and eating!Shop and Eat till you drop!"
SKIN CARE HEAVEN,"my favorite place in SEOUL , my hotel is located near myeong-dong , so do the math . how many time did I went there just to shop for all my skin care and makeup "
Not to be missed,We stayed at the Lotte Hotel just across the road from one of streets leading into the market. Even after a trip to another location we would find ourselves being drawn into the bright lights and great street food of Myeongdong. The shopping is great for accessories like scarves and bags. Lots of cosmetic shops. We found that there is quite a turnover of stalls and new ones pop up on different nights. If you see something you like buy it because it may not be there tomorrow or you won't find the location again. The food in the market (my best was spiral fries on a stick) is better than most restaurants around the market. You can see what you are buying whereas ordering off a menu can lead to some inedible surprises. Aside from going up to the DMZ this was our second favourite experience. 
Ripoff outdoor food carts ,We went practically everyday as our hotel was just across the road and would pick up snacks and have dinner at all the restaurants in the alleyways.The food from all the carts are a tourist trap and charge as much as a full meal for a skewer of food. 1/2 a tiny bag of pomegranate juice at 6000W was the biggest ripoff of all. Their prices were inconsistent and I saw that locals were charged half of what tourists were paying. When I confronted the stall owner he just pretended he couldn't understand me. The restaurants in the alleys are much better and you get a full meal out of the same price.
The streets are alive!,"Love this place...night stalls and cafes and food establishments aplenty. Lots of shopping too. Personally, nothing beats the fact that it is such a vibrant place...especially at night. Plenty of hotels there and a good place to see Seoul by night."
Shopping haven,"This street is full of food and shopping!! Never got tired of it, we were there for 5 nights in a roll coz it's so long and filled with so much food that we couldn't hv sampled all in a single night. Go there empty stomach and eat to your fill! Skin care shops are everywhere... there's a big MCM outlet somewhere too!"
The best place to shop,This is the best place to find all your beauty addiction. Super crowded and a lot of shops you can enter and they also have a lot of promotions. There is also a lot of street foods you can try. 
The best of the best retails stores in Seoul,"Myengdong Shopping District has it all. Apparel, cheap bargains, yummy korean foods, branded clothes, souvenirs, skincare, name it, Myeongdong has it all. If you wanna go cheap finds, you just need to walk around first for you to compare prices and for you to enjoy the whole myengdong district. "
Best shopping district in Seoul,Myeongdong has a great variety of shops to cater for all levels of budget. Range of prices vary so it is important to shop also in the smaller alleys and boutiques. Quality is good and do make sure you get good quality Made in Korea stuff. Lots of cosmetic shops as what Seoul is famous for. Facial masks and hand lotions are aplenty; take time to shop. Samples available freely. Korean street food is simply great and cheap in Myeongdong! Easy to move around and safe. Make sure you have strong arms ready to lug your shopping items around as there is simply too much to see till the very late hours.
What a great place to people watch!,You can snack on everything from cheese-coated lobster to hand spun sugar strings on an almond. Most of the stores are geared towards younger women and couples.
Get a glimpse of Korean shopping street,My stay in Seoul was really short. I stayed in hotel Solaria at Myeongdong. Only night was available for exploring. Its a nice place enjoy busy Seoul nights with street foods. Muslim travelers can explore the street foods as there are several Halal certified restaurants. For shopping I actually saw lots of beauty products shop.
Exciting food trip plus beauty products.. Only in Korea!!,"Fantastic food street ! There were treats for everybody from grilled, saucy chicken Bbq (3000 won) to grilled Scallops and Lobsters (8000 k won). You can also find there shrimps and squids on a stick, yummy strawberries at KWon 6,000.00 and the freshly squeezed promegnarade at krw5000. And if you're tired tasting the new and exciting food in the street, you may want to go inside the beauty shops and treat yourself to a Facial Mask from cucumber , Apple, pineapple to Snail and Ginseng facial mask in a pouch. Buy and give a gift to yourself and your friends at home the original BB CREAM now in Cushion. BY THE way, if you are a kimchi lover, enroll in Kimchi making along MYEONDONG and bring home the kimchi you made !"
Shopping,Every women's place to visit.it's a shopping area where one can buy souvenirs and a lot of cosmetics.
Best place to eat street food,"Myeongdong was the place I probably went to the most while I was in Seoul. For some reason I would gravitate to that place almost every night. The food is pretty cheap depending on what you get. There are many shops but I found many of them started repeating after a certain distance. When I went, the sales for some of the shops were even better than the duty-free places I went to so I do recommend going there for last minute shopping."
A must place to visit for shopping addicts!,A must place to visit for shopping addicts and street food snackers! Lots of skinscare/beauty shops to visit. They even have 3 faceshop stores there! Most shops close at 10pm however street food are open till late. One place I recommend to buy from there and regret not buying more is 'Great King of Castella'. 
Top Touristic Spot in Seoul,"A lot of stores, some of them with really amazing sales (especially cosmetics). You can enjoy the traditional and the modern in this street."
So many shops and restaurants and street food!,"This place is amazing! For the shoppers, they have department store settings with flea market prices!For the foodies - WOW! I wished I had multiple stomachs!!! They have Korea, Japanese, Chinese AND around 4pm majority of the street food vendors start setting up!This is one place that you want to do multiple visits. During the day, they also have people in vests to assist you should you get turned around in this maze of stores and restaurants. It's also pretty clean for the amount of people that's there.The only complaint that I have is that there is a LOT of people there that at times I felt too crowded in. "
Big shopping street ,"It assume all local cosmetics brand such etude house, skinfood, nature republic and including street food at night time. "
Enjoy the night while shopping,"At night the place is visited by many people. Many stores sell goods, especially fashion. We can find good stuff at reasonable prices. Along the way, many people who sell drinks and typical Korean snacks."
Another tourist area,"Crowded and overrated but I'd still choose it over Hongdae any time. The area is huge and it has much more options when it comes to shopping or eating out, also it's possible to find restaurants and bars little bit on the more sophisticated side. I especially like to come here in the mornings when it's almost empty and tourists hasn't flooded the place yet. There are lots of cafes and also cinemas around, it's great to meet up with friends or even your significant other if you're in the mood to spend some time in a lively setting. Come here to exchange money, shop for cosmetics or street food, if that's the sort of thing you're into."
good place,"This is the good place have all of the thing you can buy, And Loisir hotel is a good location in this area."
Shop till you drop!,"This is a shopping heaven for girls! There are lanes and lanes of Korean make up stores throughout Myeongdong Shopping District.We spent lots of time and money here buying all sort of make up and also enjoying the street and restaurant food available.Typically, you can spend the whole day here considering the amount of shops and food you can find here.Also, sinc you are gonna burst your wallet here, its good to know that there are plenty of good money changer in this area, trying asking around for the different rates. You can easily get very very good rates."
Where the locals shop,"We needed another suitcase, so we came here, we looked, and we bought. Plenty of choices within a relatively small area, and prices were good. "
Something for everyone,"As others said, go on an empty stomach and with plenty of money. Street food paradise - make sure you stop by the strawberry mochi stand and the flower gelato place. Lots of shopping but surprisingly little variety - cosmetics, clothes, bags, and socks. Tons of skin care shops, but many of the same chain in different locations. Plus side: awesome 1+1 sales on masks! Massive crowds at all times and occasional vehicle traffic at night.On Sundays (at least the two Sundays I was in town), there are religious groups distributing literature protesting verichip implants. Some of the content may be disturbing to kids (references and images of the ""mark of the beast"")."
Food Street Wow!,"A great selection of food stalls to chose from. Very crowded when we were there over Xmas, New Year but enjoyable just the same. Try different foods as you stroll around the area. Dress warm as it was a bit chilly in Dec. Jan."
Great shopping!,"There were so much stores and food vendors. Little alley ways with stores and restaurants. Lots and lots of beauty shops like The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc... Lots of food vendors which was great! We went during the summer and it was extremely hot! Just wear shorts and a tank top and you're good! During the summer is just way too crowded. "
Go with an empty stomach and a full wallet!,"On a long layover in Seoul, I decided to head to Myeongdong. In short, this is shopping heaven. There are a lot of options if you are looking for skin care products. Don't be too easily lured in by the free masks and don't be afraid to ask for extra samples if you do chose to make a purchase at a store. There are also a ton of street food vendors. The prices vary, but it all fairly inexpensive. You could easily come with an empty stomach and leave very satisfied. I wish I ate more when I was there!"
"Great places, night market","If you want korean street snacks, just come here so many type and many shop thay you can buy, this street market only available on night"
Plan 3 hours. Don't eat first. ,There is plenty of food so don't eat before you go. Stop at all the booths. The prices are different at different booths. Some bartering. Great. Easy to walk around. Easy to get around for young children and older folks. 
Beauty mecca,"IF you can speak chinese, never an issue here. Almost all the shop staffs can speak better chinese than english. Beauty haven! All the different beauty brands have diff stores all over this area. Heard that some are from the direct brand while some are franchise. Direct stores can do instant de-taxe - meaning you pay the tax-free price. While franchise stores you will still need to get the tax back from the airport. But do note that the tax amount being returned is not by percentage. I.e if you spend 30k-50k won , you will get back 2000won. 50-90k won, you will get back 3 or 5000 won. The tax rebate goes along this way. At least this was what I was told by the shop assistants. "
Myeongdong shopping,Forever21 store has the best collection at this place. Street shopping was little costly compared to other subway shopping in Korea. 
Must visit if in Seoul,"There are sooo many shopping streets in Korea, but Myeongdong is the mecca of shopping streets.Such a huge and lively place with heaps of shopping, street foods and restaurants.We just enjoyed walking around, getting lost, being in on the action, eating along the way and checking out the wares. A must visit at least once when in Seoul.Myeongdong is also in quite a central location in Seoul, so it's a good hub to wander around the surrounding areas too.Heaps of fun, especially at night! Beware the cars that drive through!"
"Streetfood, fashion, cosmetics, skincare shopping",A busy street where you will lose track of the number of streetfood stalls and shops selling the cosmetics and skincare!
huge but little variety,The shopping street is huge but most of the shops are selling similar items. The street food is diverse as compared to dongdaemun and namdaemun.
Great street food..,"Been here every night since we came as our hotel is quite nearby... street food is amazing, though I wonder why they allow cars to pass by this very busy stretch... great place to just hang out, shop n.eat... "
MyeonDong shopping street,"Very lively in the evening, lots of street food and of course the famous Korean cosmetics outlets are all over along the streets. I think you can find almost all brands here"
You can't miss this place! ,"A place that you can't miss when you're here in Korea! Paradise of cosmetic and mask!!! You can't really bargain much here but definitely you can ask for more freebies. We visited this place 3-4 times when we're there for a week and the freebies we collected, almost 1/3 of what we bought!!*although there are still some staff that are quite stingy in giving but most of them are generally generous*A lot of Chinese speaking staff available and most of the staff speaks basic English so no communication at there, you can totally enjoy the shopping experience.They sell cosmetic stuff mostly in bundles, especially masks and when you buy in bulk(I mean really huge bulk), they can really give you good discount. They do sell other stuff like clothing, accessories and FOOD along the pathway. The food are Super yummy and very much needed time to time when you need some break time from the shopping but they can be quite pricey so just be remember to check for the price before buying, to prevent getting some heart Attack when paying. Enjoy your shopping as I did. "
Shopping Paradise,"Its easy to go - Myenong-dong subway station. The street is full of Korean cosmetics brand - Face Shop, Etude House, Nature Republic, Innisfree, Tony Moly etc. There are restaurants as well - one stop. You can spend a whole day there. Spend 3 hours and still on the 1st street. The sales staff at the cosmetic shops all speak Mandarin and basic English. Do you homework on what you want to buy before going, unless you have lots of time to spare. Too many shops, too little time. The street are crowded. There is street food after 4 pm. A must go for Ladies! Most Mask are on promotion $10000 won for 20 pcs. Have Fun !"
Enjoyed the year end sales in different stores,"If you love to shop, this area is the place to be! Popular korean cosmetic stores can be found in every block. Duty free shopping malls are also walking distance from this area. Namsan tower is also near this area."
Tonnes of stuff,"A great place to go for shopping for clothes, shoes and other goods. Everything looks exactly the same and prices vary so don't be afraid to comparison shop or haggle :) "
best place for shopaholic/dining,You'll find this very popular place for Korean cosmetics shop and dining around this area. The sellers are familiar with travelers so very easy to stay here
More glitz less character.,"Myeongdong has really changed in the last 10 years or so. It used to be a hip hangout, more focused on eating and secondly on shopping, though the latter was in plentiful supply. The favourtie foods used to be special noodle (myeongdong kalguksu) - still around and butter squid grilled on hot stones (disappeared). Today, the district is even more about shopping, less about hanging out and mostly caters to tourists. Good eats are still to be found, but everyhing feels even more commercialised than before. "
Best place to buy cosmetics,"There are more skin care stores per square feet than any other place in a Seoul, maybe the world! All chains, new and old, are represented on the pedestrian streets of Myeongdong. As well well as many eateries. The shop workers speak many languages so communication should be no problem"
Hustle and bustle,"Beauty sales women are savage. They have free face masks to lure you in. If you don't buy, some will take it backGood street food. Had a medium lobster tail for 15,000₩ which is a little luxurious. Had fried chicken for 5,000₩Well known brands obviously. If you want cheaper clothes for similar styles, go to the shops underground. "
"eat, shop, fun","Myeongdong is the most popular place for shopping, but with so many little stalls staying there, it also turns out to be a food street.You will be addicted to different kinds of snacks (rice cakes, sausages, fish cakes, noodles, cakes, cotton candy, or steak, lobsters, scallops...etc.). and, of course you can shop your handbags, phone cases, clothes, accessories...etc."
My Fave Market,My favorite market to visit...a week in Seoul..i came to this place 4 times...interest cafes..beauty shops..learn to make kimchi..hunting Kpop merchandises...try the street-food...still want to go back... 
Shopping at Myeongdong,Too touristy and street food are very expensive which you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Shops are pretty similar from one street to another. Our boys enjoy the cat cafe there.
Ladies Shopping Paradise,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is indeed a shopping paradise catered for ladies in general. An area of about 1 square mile, from my estimates, is filled with Korean cosmetics shops. Mainly they sell face masks / cosmetic masks. Plenty of restaurants and snack food stalls scattered all over the streets. You'll be spoil t for choice. Its a surreal experience. If you are in Seoul, don't miss visiting this shopping zone. "
Great for shoppers,"Many shops dot the street, especially skin care products like Innisfree, Nature Republic, Tony Moly. Specially love the free samples. In the evening, as you shop, you can also fill rumbling tummies with the street food. The street food is lovely and you will be spoilt for choice but a bit expensive. Having said that, I would still recommend trying the assortment of street food. "
Lots of shopping but lots of tourists!,"Myeongdong is a lot of take in but if you're a seasoned shopper you'll be in your element. The main draw card here are it's expansive selection of Korean Beauty shops - you'll find all the brands here tend to have multiple shops and you often get free samples for going in. Would recommend you go to the official brand shop as you will 100% get authentic products there as well as Olive Young.There is also lots of young fashion and street brands - I really like A-Land, 8 seconds, the LINE shop and the little boutiques with the $10 t-shirts. Food wise you will never go hungry! Check out Myeongdong noodle if you want a good hearty lunch, Milky Bee for the infamous rose gelato or all the awesome street food. One thing to watch are the rather pushy sales people outside the stalls, the worst experience I encountered was one lady who latched on to me and wouldn't let me go. My tip is to be assertive and not feel pressured to buy things you don't want. If you really feel coerced report to one of the tourist police centers or to one of the tourist helpers in red. Personally this was fine for me as I've been to more aggressive markets but I can see how this could be an issue for some people.Other than that, I highly recommend Myeongdong. I went everyday on my holiday and never ran out of things to do plus there are so many currency exchange places to get more won if you need - wear some walking shoes and be prepared to leave with lots of bags!"
Big high street but same shops,"If you're looking to shop then this high street is recommended. But you get the same shops repeating themselves down every road, mainly beauty shops. But the street food stalls are plenty and loads to choose from. Also there's a few cat and dog cafes dotted around."
"""Great for cosmetics shopping choices including apparels""","If you are looking for great shopping, Myeongdong-dong shopping street is amazing. Value for money and great finds as well."
"Shops, next to shops, next to even more shops","A heaven to all shopping crazed girls who love makeup and Korean fashion = me.Visited Myeongdong on my last day in Korea, which is super dumb (btw). I went on a Saturday at around 10:30 and it was mildly crowded. Myeongdong is just a lot of shops compacted into one district, so I'm just going to list some advice. 1. Don't buy everything first. When you first reached there you would be pulled into buying everything. Explore first, there is like 5 of the same stores located everywhere, so don't rush and look around and you might get a better deal and not regret your purchase.2. Grab a map. Whether you are staying in a small hotel in Myeongdong or outside the area. Is good to grab a map and plan which shops you want to go. Planning is the only way you could maximise your visit. Of course, you would not list to the minutes you are going to stay in one shop, but having a list of the shops you want to see really helps. 3. If you like shopping and know shopping is going to be the highlight, try booking a hotel in Myeongdong itself. It really is a plus when you have many bags to carry and your hotel is in Myeongdong. It also allow you to maximise your time there, no wasting time on transport time. 4. Try the street food! My biggest regret was spending way too much shopping and not enjoying the atmosphere and the food. Eating a little bit of each and trying out Korean traditional food would be a good memory. (My brother ate a lot of street food)5. Don't try to explore Myeongdong in one day. Its not that you can't try, it's more like you can't. (if you love shopping and Korean stuff in general) There is a lot of things to cover and trying to rush everything will just make you tired and unfocused, forgetting what you plan to buy in the first place. 6. Don't miss the Lotte Young Plaza. Again if you have big interest in Korean fashion and makeup, Lotte Young Plaza is a must go. Not only can you find SUM (SM entertainment shop) but you can also find the YG equivalent of that. You could also find online makeup brands like April Skin or Pony Effect there, which we all know is hard to get or expensive to get online. I also checked out Moonshot there (in my opinion its way overpriced). They also showcase a lot of underground Korean clothing labels that are affordable for teenagers. I didn't get to explore Lotte Young Plaza much, thus not sure if there are other online brands available. I hope my advice come to use. Myeongdong was fun and a must visit."
Women literally gone nuts here,"Myeongdong is the mecca where Asian women flock to, to have their dose of make-up purchase. Their selling attributes are duty free, and on top of that, make up companies shower the guests with FREE samples. The moment you thought you have closed the deal by swiping your credit card, the shop owners will tempt you to buy some more with further add-ons such as free delivery to country of your choice. If it's not good enough, what about if they pile you up with more freebies to give to your families and friends back home. Just when you wish to walk away, the owners will give you a wry smile, and then, pile you up with even more free gifts. Talking about killing you softly and gently with kindness, this is as good as it gets. You may find all make up stores here comprise of Chinese speaking sales assistants and all of them originated from North Korea bordering to China. Myeongdong shopping is not something that I have witnessed anywhere else in the world. There's an element of frenziness to it. Just when you think this would be it, there's also Lotte Duty Free stores, Shinsagae Duty Free stores, Doota Duty Free stores, and all of them are featuring stars from your favourite Korean drama. Be wowed and be overwhelmed. It is quite surreal."
So much to take in,"Myeongdong has lots and lots of shops, food carts, etc. Even if you're not a shopper, it's still cool to window shop and take in the Korean culture. There are so many stores selling beauty masks! You can also get some neat sock designs for cheap at the carts."
Just a typical shopping street.,Crowded during the evening. Food booths are nothing special. Typical shops. Restaurants and Bar are around.
Shopping haeven in Seoul,Shopping Street around this area some biggest shopping mal and foodstreet stand with all kind of Korean dishesMany discount Korean Brand cosmetic shop 
Shopping and more shopping,Be ready to shop! Lots and lots of shops! A great place to people watch and enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city. Watch out for good deals. They can offer a bit. And try out the food stalls. 
Makeup!! Food!!,"Streets filled with makeup shops (ie. Leaders, Etude House, Club Clio, 3CE, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Face Shop, Espoir, A'Pieu...). If you go late at night there are little stands with street food (a little pricey, but good). Bring your passport and you can get an instant tax refund (most brands has at least one instant tax refund shop there from what I've seen). Also both times I went (summer/winter) All Masks Shop was having a 1+1 sale (BOGO) which was awesome and definitely a lot more worth it than going to each specific shop to get my masks."
Lots of fun places to shop,"We took our teenage daughter there with a friend. It was really fun for her to be able to shop in her hometown for the first time. There were lots of places that she loved to shop at and the prices were really good. There was everything from uni-qlo to Forever 21. Would definitely go back,"
"Interesting, colorful, treat for the senses","Wonderful place to shop, eat, try different local street food. Lots of different clothing, apparel, cosmetics stores. Quiet in the mornings but when we went at night it was a very exciting place with many different street stalls selling all kinds of street food, clothes, souvenirs, fruits, etc. We had dinner right there in the street. Accessible by subway or on foot if you are staying in the Myeungdong area. Also good shopping in the underground subway station. Restaurant prices could be a bit more pricey than those away from the main street as we spent more than a hundred US dollars for a traditional Korean barbeque dinner for four but about 70 dollars for the same thing elsewhere. For us, it was a worthwhile place to visit more than once. "
Shopping heaven!,"There are literally same brans on every street. Etude house, innisfree, holika holika, banila & co, nature republic, tony moly, etc, you can find them on almost every streets in Myeongdong. There is also street food at night. Best to visit at night if you have limited time. "
Must Place to Visit!,"For those who look for good shopping and great food on the streets. This place is a must to visit! Lots of stores selling beauty products like Innisfree, Olive Young etc and local snack food on the streets eat it while its piping hot. Alot of well known stores as well in this district such as Uniqlo, H&M, their local ABC mart etc where you can buy staffs at cheap prices."
Crazy place for the Shopoholics !!!!,"Seoul as it is, is known for ""All Things CUTE"" - bet it the cutesy character socks or the tops or the actors or anything, I just love this place <3So this street has got major beauty brands, apparels, other nifty items, accessories and everything else you can think of !!! :) Besides, they have a vast variety of Street Food Stalls here serving barbeque, rolls and other food, which is totally yummilicious. If you come to Seoul and dont visit this shopping street then I can say that your trip is wasted!!!I bought some Beauty Products from the shops here and they are serving me great. Seoul has got some amazing brands and one should try the Face Masks which are quite a trend here."
Paradise for Shopaholics!,"Miss out a shop and regret for not buying anything? NO WORRIES! The streets have multiple shop outlets for skin care brands such as skinfood, nature republic and the Saem! Food street is awesome but are expensive. Many eateries to choose from and too much to shop! Behold Shopaholics!"
Favorite shopping area,"Is really a shopping paradise for those who love Korean fashion and even Korean food. There are tons of shops including clothes, cosmetics and skin care. I would recommend star 101 for those who love a budget clothing. At night, you should try out all the little food store there, cuz they are amazing.Overall, loved this place xx"
Street food,"It says shopping street but this title is apt only if you are looking for clothes or facial products. The main reason we like this area is the street food...and we even had ice cream in Dec when temperatures are below freezing (well, the ice-cream did not melt). Oh yes, we tried all the other street foods from egg bread to fish pancake to tornado potato. Good place for after dinner snacks. "
"Street food, eateries and Korean beauty products","Similar like a 'pasar malam' in between a long row of shops. Explored the area and found lots of Korean beauty products, any brand that you are looking for. Plenty of young ladies who brought their pull on luggages - i think to replenish their stocks. There were also plenty of eateries around. Japanese, Korean, BBQ and etc. the thing was that they were mostly on level 1 onwards which requires us to climb steps up (a little difficult for us who travelled with baby stroller) - Similar like Hong Kong. The street food sold there wasn't exactly cheap either. Strawberries at KRW7000 (Though they were good quality, juicy, sweet and plump and a box has approximately 2 dozen strawberries) KRW1500 for a roasted sweet potato, KRW1000 for a piece of sweet pancake, KRW1000 for a grilled cheese stick. Having said that, the quality food is good. As i wasn't there to shop till i drop, i think the experience was ok though the weather was really harsh."
Shopping street with food stalls,"Visited this area on our last day in Korea around 6.30 pm. It was quite a busy area. Lots of shops (individual ones) i.e. Zara, H&M, Adidas, Nike. On top of that, there are food stalls offering local food as well as stalls selling :souvenirs and winter accessories i.e. ear muff, gloves.When I was there, international brands mentioned earlier was on sale, so got lucky to buy things at lower price :-)In my view it's similar to Ladies Market in Hongkong. Fun to stroll along and shop.*TK"
Shopping paradise,"Totally love this area. Very good for shopping especially for beauty products. If you are hesitant about buying in the first shop and leave, you will likely walk past another one or two of the same shop farther down the road or at a different section of Myeongdong. Remember to produce your passport at the counter to get the tourist tax refund on the spot if you spend above 30000won so that you don't need to do tax refund at the airport. Also shopped for shoes for my friends. Do compare prices in different shops. For example, Adidas shop didn't have discount but down the street in Les More and ABC shops (less than 2mins away on foot), the same pair of shoes was on discount and priced about 10% cheaper. Sweet strawberries are on sale from 8000-10000won per box. Cute socks for kids and adults on sale at 1000won each in the underground shopping street where the subway is. Up at the street level, one might find the socks selling at 1500won per pair and 7 pairs for 10000won. During peak hours when the food stalls are set up, walking can be a challenge as the road gets crowded. So, do factor a bit more time for walking. Tried the Bingsu (shaved ice dessert) at a level 2 shop which overlooks the shopping street. Free Wifi is provided in most food establishments and also in the Seoul Global Cultural Centre (located at level 5 of M Plaza).A bit disappointed with Myeongdong's Migliore which is a huge difference from its Dongdaemun version. Other than that, Myeongdong has all that I wanted such as street food (tried the egg bun, corn cob, pomegranate juice, lobster with cheese, potatoes etc), shopping (supermarket, clothes, shoes, bags, beauty products etc), Hanbok dress-up experience and the lovely Myeongdong Cathedral. The place is lively in the day and even more alive at night. It is a very nice location to stay in. "
Good shopping and food street!,"Plenty of shops, especially for makeup and cosmetics products. The food street is wonderful as well, good variety."
Favorite shopping street!,"Lots of shops, street vendors and restaurants.Try the 32cm ice cream, egg bun and other street food because they are yummy If you're looking for branded Korean cosmetics, this is the right place.There is a shop that sell merchandises, CD, etc if you like K-Pop or drama."
Very busy.,This is worth seeing at least once. Only once. It's very cool to walk down but it's very busy and full of foreigners. Prices of things are sometimes higher than a typical Korean area because of the high number of foreigners.
"Densely streets with food hawkers, skincare shops to make it famous","We have walked through the main Myeong-dong and several sub-streets nearby, you will be surprised flooded with skincare shops in different brands, mostly Korean like Innisfree, and food hawkers in different types of snacks and eat, fabulous. You will be exited by the types of eat provided, and the speed of service provided by the hawkers. If you want to find restaurant, then you need to search either basement of 2nd floor. The street shops and hawkers close at 23:00, be there at time after dinner."
Great for shopping,"A very popular shopping street with tons of Korean cosmetic brands as well as other internationally known fashion brands. Nearby is the huge Lotte department store. Be warned that it gets very crowded in the late afternoon. Some shops get very cramped and service can be non-existent if you are not buying much, as many shops get lots of tourists from mainland China who buy in bulk."
Myeongdong shopping street,It's like Malaysia's Petaling Street. Good place to shop for facial masks etc. But the people can be very rude. People just push and push without consideration for old people. One good thing is South Korea provides information centres almost every where so you wont get lost. Many things to eat.
Great shopping area ever,"This venue offers you with diverse types of merchandises, foods, cosmetics, etc.Not only shopping centers, you can have more entertaining activities, such as: Nanta show, having great traditional Korean massage, chill out in the coffee shops and just exploring the area and choose the best way to enjoy!"
Super lively street,"The street is super lively, filled with people and loads of street food. I tried a few stalls and it is incredible! "
Festival of Light - Amazing,"Christmas time in Myeongdong is unreal. The streets are absolutely swarming with shoppers, salespeople and food vendors. The tree lights and lights on the building illuminate the streets as if it were the middle of the day. It truly was an experience. Sales are pretty handy around this time too. Must see in Seoul."
Love love this place,"I love shopping and this place is a mecca. Im near SFO but I think I left my heart in Myeongdong Shopping Street. I love the night street food, the makeup stores, the vibrance of the atmosphere and the variety of products. I can never get bored here even if I have to come back everyday."
The Centre of the old shopping area downtown,This area has a long history in the 1950s it was the Centre of fashion and Korean delights. Now it has really turned into a tourist go zone and has lost some of its appeal. The cathedral is a must at the end and the famous Myeongdong kalguksu noodle place is still there. Go early. Across the road is lotte dept store and Shinsegae. Take bus 143 straight to apkujeong rodeo street 25 mins or the subway. This area is famous for up style dining and living. V good coffee at Mark Lane brewers. South Gate market is also 10 mins walk where you can buy anything. These places are a must. 
Insane shopping street,Myeongdong has come a long way since the first time I visited in 2006. It's now a hyper crazy night market where you can eat and shop to your hearts content.If crazy throngs of people aren't your thing then I'd definitely stay away.
Shop til you drop,I didnt expect that this place was entirely a shopping place! Lovely to see it at night. Bunch of street foods are all over the place! If you want to buy beauty products this place is on top. 
"K-beauty haven, overpriced street food","Best of Korean beauty brands everywhere - same brand, multiple shops. Shopping not the cheapest, but one can find almost anything there - uniqlo, H&M, sports outlets with Nike, Adidas, Vans & Superga, local clothing & accessories ...... the list is neverending. Street food is generally more expensive than other shopping streets like Dongdaemun, Edae and Hongdae - and not as tasty. "
Busy shopping street,"Heaven for girls, with many skincare brands located here (Laneige, The Face Shop, Etude House, Tony Moly, etc..) Shop till you drop!"
Shop till you drop,Many malls and shops in the area so do leave a few hours to explore and shop. A must visit if you are in seoul.
One of my favorite places in Seoul ,"+ Lots of food choices + Yummy street foods+ Lots of makeup stores + Money changers are everywhere+ There are English speaking guides who are always ready to help + You can find the cat and dog cafes here + Malls across the road+ Grab a rose ice cream at Milkybee (for your Instagram feed lol)+ Visit Style Nanda (Another instagrammable place for girls)+ Shopping, shopping, shopping- Some street foods are pricey like the lobster and oyster with cheese (15,000 won) I can already eat at a buffet restaurant or unlimited Korean BBQ plus soju with that price "
Cosmetics Everywhere,"If you like Korean cosmetics such as Etude House, Face shop, Aritaum, Moonshot, Skin food, The saem, etc, try to go here as it's one of the most complete cosmetics area and it's good for tourist. Most vendors here can speak korean well, chinese well, little english and little japanese. There's not many clothes and souvenirs here but there's a lot of street snacks at night. The price of the street snacks are a little bit overpriced but if you don't really have other time to go to other place such as hongdae and sinchon, this might be a good place for you to buy foods. There's zara, uniqlo, h&m, forever21, daiso, top10, 8seconds, spao, lotte young (mall), lotte duty free, shinsege department store, myeongdong cathedral, myeongdong theater, nanta theater, Haha's restaurant, Myeongdong Gyoza, Kang hodong's bbq restaurant, hello kitty cafe, cat cafe, dog cafe and many more."
Late afternoon stroll,"Lots of street stalls selling food and many to choose from. Felt the price is quite expensive, eg 4000W for a stick of sausages and 15,000W for half a cheese lobster. Place is very crowded, despite the cold weather and windy condition. Do wear lots of warm clothing. We also discovered there is an underground shopping area connected to the train station. A good place to get back some body warm. "
"Lots of choices, if you like cosmetics and womens clothing","Very interesting, street food, lots of people, and if you're a women great shopping! If your a guy you will follow your wife into many stores. What do you do? People watching is very good, many people from many different cultures. Street photographers will love the opportunity! "
Shopping for everyone!,This was area just seemed to keep going and going. There were tons of shops and restaurants. There were also street vendors for food and souvenirs as well. Great experience!
SHOPPING!!,"Myeongdong is one of the must-visit if we come to Seoul. Do not know what drew us to come here every time. There are a variety of cosmetic and street food that can be enjoyed. In Dec this year, I found halal kebab was sell here. There are a variety of designer goods can be found."
Korean Adventure ,This where we really enjoyed our Korean adventure. Shopping galore and the street food was awesome. I will not forget this experience. 
Food shopping everywhere ,Nice shopping area especially in the evening with good restaurants and good food stalls on the street and good shopping area.
Shop like crazy here!,I went here everyday during our stay. I went crazy with all the cosmetic and other stuff! So affordable! And there's a lot of street foods to choose from here. 
Myeongdong Shopping Street,Myeongdong Shopping Street is vibrant and bustling! Many shops and restaurants around and street food vendors selling a variety of yummy street food too! Definitely worth a visit! Thumbs up!
A surprise!,"This is a late review, but I wanted people to know that this place is worth going to. We're a family of 5 adults, and wanted our Dec. 2015 week-long vacation somewhere cold, so we chose Korea. Being our first time, we were not expecting much because we haven't heard much about places in Korea being raved about. I based all my plans on TripAdvisor reviews & as always, it pulled through for me. We just wanted to be near a church to celebrate birthday & anniversary events we were having, so we chose Myeongdong area as our base. Little did we know that our celebration would be so festive, as this Street suddenly comes alive at night! During the day, it looks like a shoppers haven with all the stores lined up along the streets, international branded names like Adidas & Giordano, as well as outstanding Korean brands like SPAO. Lots of beauty products & restaurants everywhere! Most surprising are the food carts rolled out by nightfall and lining the middle of the streets with the most amazing assortment of streetfood I have ever seen! So organized, efficient, clean and very tasty. Even the locals come to enjoy it. It's quite crowded like a night market, but we enjoyed the experience. Colorful lights & music abound, and my young adults were like children hopping from one place to another and can't get enough of all the sights and sounds and food! Perfect place for us to celebrate Christmas season. This area a bit pricey to stay, but book early to get best rates. It's worth it."
"Packed with people, food and shops",Can't say it is something special but must go through at least once if you visit Seoul. Many different street foods and shops. Got a little taste of the local life and culture. 
Overated on hotel,Near shopping street and near subway. But hotel room is small and towel is also very small. Will not recommend this hotel. 
Packed. ,"I'm a girl who does not wear make up for daily purposes. And never really been interested in it. But MyeongDong has definitely open my eyes for a new reason to actually like and wear make up. My summary of MD: Make-up, tourist, food, make-up.Plenty of hostels around the area, and it's a couple of blocks away from Lotte Shopping Mall.And there are plenty of streetfood around the area that you might want to try. "
great street food,My daughter's favorite place to walk and buy street food. Every imaginable type of street food available from vendors.
Shopping Heaven,"Best shopping place in Seoul. Lotte department store, lotte young plaza and sinsegei dept store are just a short walk away. You can find almost anything here ( cosmetics, clothes, accessories, food , cafes) from cheap street vendors to high end brands. The night market sells a lot of delicious korean traditional street food. A must visit when you are in Seoul."
Get readt for the hustle and bustle,Can be quiet busy so if you have small children keep them near.. the market has an abundance of socks and face masks so be prepared to see them every corner.. food is easily found.
Heaven for ladies! ,"Went there four times during my trip to Korea last week. Lots of restaurant and cosmetic stores! But be careful, street food there isn't that cheap, you can get cheaper food in the market instead. On the other side, restaurant were basically crowded and food was nice! It's better to shop for your cosmetics there because there's always sale there! "
Shop until we drop ,Wish we have more time as too many things to see and buy. Not everything are cheap but still reasonable compared to other places. 
shopping,Clouded with the tourists and a lot of branded shops and cosmetic shops every where. Easy to find. Try to avoid lunch time and clouded spot. 
Cosmetic bazaar,"It's a shopping haven. Clothing, cosmetics and food. Woman would love this place for the numerous cosmetic shops here. Some of the best Korean eating houses are also located here. To entice couples to enter these cosmetic shops many have seats intended for men while they wait for their spouse/girlfriends who shop there.There is even a supermarket here. Not too large but nonetheless you can get most of what you need from this supermarket."
Winter sales is on,I have been here twice. Beauty products especially facial masks are on sales. Lots of restaurants and street foods are the best. You can bargain in small shops and enjoy big discount from shopkeepers. 
Shopping,Great place to shop everything's here and very close to the cathedral church. Most of the shops id not all are on sale. The street foods are also great!!!
Shopping place,shopping place is here don't go anywhere especially girls all cosmetics heaven and food. From bimbimbap to barbecue it's just tantalizing. 
Things become expensive,Myeongdong was a tourist spot and all the stuff there become more expensive than last few year. The people there were no longer friendly and some of the cosmetic shop staffs will run in front of us and show u the free gift and keep asking us to go in the shop. this is really ignoring us.
Very fun and exciting especially at night!,"It is a very busy place which is normally open to quite late. There will always be people walking by and salespeople will come up to you to promote especially with freebees. Now remember that there are actually many small streets and corners you can go to and there are a great amount of restaurants, shoe shops, clothes shops, a few kpop stores and especially a lot of beauty stores. A LOT of beauty stores. You will see most of them on the main street however if you happen to be walking in a smaller street there are always smaller versions of the shops. It is best coming at night (when its not freezing cold) as there will be loads of lights and also there will be a lot of street food which you can enjoy. The street food is very delicious and can already fill you up! You might not find many bins so you might have to hold onto your rubbish for a while but through this you will notice that the area is generally quite clean for a place lacking of bins. Overall, coming to this shopping street was a very great experience and is literally next to the train station."
The Place in Seoul,"I didn't get to see everything this time but MyeongDong is to be the classic hangout in Seoul access to everything & everywhere. Next to all the tall skyscrapes and adjacent to the famous Catholic church of Seoul, Korea. Very ironical but it works & very classic.Whether sad or happy, this was the place to hang out on Saturday for real shopping or just eye-shopping. It was different every week.It's nostalgic place for us Koreans there & Koreans overseas. Now, it's more touristic than every before but still the place to hang out for everyday or for weekend.The Japanese-Korean owned hotel, Royal Hotel Seoul is very Asian looking one that I have seen and very chic. All renovated and very clean right in the middle of MyongDong. Seoul needs some changes or renovations in infra-structure but it'd be on-going economic issue and hope they can renovate with Korean themes intact instead of erasing it."
Everybody buys something different,"It's not for the impatient. Night time makes for a more adventurous feeling than day time here, especially when it gets downright chilly, that's when the steam from food stalls, neon lights, and vendors illuminated with bare bulbs all mingle to create a magical vibe. Of course, it's for shoppers, bargain hunters, tourists and locals alike. "
Only good for shopping and street food ,"If you are not into beauty products, then don't bother going. The streets have many many beauty product stores. Along one street, there can be a couple of shops baring the same brand. But it's really at a good price. So go for it. We bought quite a bit at Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Innisfree and Skin Food. Felt that the service for Skin Food and Innisfree is the most lukewarm. The staff look good but don't know basic customer service. It's a waste that the staff who stood out in the cold work so hard to welcome customers, and the staff inside the store disgust customers with seemingly judging and unfriendliness. The street food seems to be of higher priced than the traditional markets like Dongdaemun. Tried the banana crepe with Nutella, grilled prawns and chestnut. They are quite expensive, can eat a meal in some sit down small joints. It's also near Lotte Malls, went for the super markets. Wonderful place to stock up on the Korean goodies like seaweed, flavoured almond nuts, kimchi, etc. "
Nice shopping street ,"Great place to be. Just take train to Myeongdong and exit by 5,6,7 or 8. A good place to get all your facial stuffs. Note there are several shops selling facial products of same brand in the area. So don't rush and remember to seek the best deal and discount. Of course don't forget to ask for freebies should you spend certain amount. Do check out the eateries in small street or level2 of building. They are cheap and good. Oh yes, bring your passport for immediate tax rebates instead of filing at airport. "
A must place to visit!,this is a must place to visit! good shopping area and also a place to enjoy seoul night life! You can find shops which carries international brands as well as local brand
A Fun Place to Shop,"The streets are crowed, there are food carts, restaurants and small vendors everywhere. The crowds are enormous but it is a fun way to spend an evening meandering around and sampling the delicious fare offered by the street carts."
Haven for beauty products and food (for tourists anyway),"You can find good deals for korean beauty products and clothes. There's a lot of street food. I cannot say this is not a tourist trap, but as a tourist, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't intend on purchasing anything, you must still visit it."
Ready your wallets,"I went to this place twice (my friend wanted to get more make-up :D). There are several shops in this area. Some are the same brand but they have different promos. If you have the time, look around first. If not, get the item if it's a good deal. I recommend the ff:1. Get a map from a tourist info center or one of the info persons wearing a red coat with information written on it.2. List down what you want to buy and its price in your country (so you know if you're getting a good deal). You may get overwhelmed at the sheer amount of items available.3. There's a tax refund for a minimum purchase of 30,000 KRW so if you have a friend, pay jointly.4. People offer freebies along the street. Don't take it unless you intend to buy from their store. And watch out for sales persons who actually pull you into their store.5. Street food in MyeongDong is more expensive compared to other places in Korea so go here with a full stomach (unless you don't mind spending more money).6. Visit the Myeong Dong tourist information center (near a bank) to try on a hanbok and take pictures for free."
If you love cosmetics...,"...You will love myeongdong Street! I specifically chose my Hotel for my short stay so that I would be within easy walking distance. I visited day and night - busy and colourful during the day but vibrant, buzzing and lit up with Christmas lights when I visited at night. There was a mix of brand name stores, eateries...and every brand of Korean cosmetic!The Street is lined with fast food stalls - I loved the prawns. English wasn't really spoken but I had no problems communicating with a combination of gestures and smiling!I was on my own but felt totally safe, even at night. Take the usual precautions and you should be absolutely fine!"
Shopping mecca for cosmetic junkies,We stayed in a guest house just a few walks away from Myeongdong Shopping Street so I was always here every night during my stay in Seoul. I enjoyed going here every night whether I was on a hunt for a good bargain or just to kill time. I enjoyed the energy and the vibe of this busy street. I am personally not into cosmetics but shopping for my friends' request was so much fun here in Myeongdong. Get lost in all the brands that this district can offer. I did enjoy the shopping and the freebie haul during this trip. Maybe next time will have a list of my own on what cosmetics to buy. 
Everything,Definitely a must-see and go-to place! There are stores left and right. You have to try the ice cream from 32parfait and all the street food which open at night! 
Look See,"This is a very ""hip"" place. Lots of shopping filled with street food stalls. Basically, you can eat at the stalls and shop and repeat again. If you are tired, you can park yourself at various cafe around the area. "
Busy and festive,"Streets are lined with lots of korean cosmetic shops and restaurants. When sun starts to set, food carts line up in the middle of these shopping streets. Bought a lot of sweet strawberries from the food carts, tried some of their street food as well. Simply love the joyous feel of the street."
Worth a visit. ,"Myeongdong is like a shopping haven, if you don't mind the crowd. I personally don't fancy crowds so it was abit of a disppointment. There's people walking aggressively and spitting almost everywhere. I find it disgusting. But the place itself is cool. The vibe is different from other shopping streets. And I LOVE the street foods! If you have not been here, do visit. If you have and didn't like it, like me, skip it. (: "
Busy ,Cool to see but it was mostly junk with a ton of people walking around. We did eat a fried donut that was awesome from a vendor. 
Vibrant night scene,"Lots of street food and vendors line the streets and you get to savour local delicacies while browsing through polo shirts, scarfs and bags etc. The buildings fringing the streets also teem with restaurants offering lots of BBQ, ginseng chicken and other mouth watering fare that will whet your appetite. Enjoy a leisurely stroll and soak up the night market atmosphere you will not forget."
Shopping!!!,"If you like/love shopping, then this is a good spot for you. And if you get hungry, enjoy the street food. i recommend the grilled lobster tail."
Shopping Paradise,Nice Christmas decorations during December and there's a lot of shops selling cosmetics and clothes around. Street food was okay but definitely much more expensive than elsewhere (about 5000 won).
Place to visit every night ,"First of all restaurants and food stands have many different things to try. You will find what satisfies you if you are young or old, men or women."
Place to eat Korean food!,"Affordable Korean food along the street!.. Cute and cheap socks made in Korea is must to buy here.. 11 pairs of socks for 10,000 Won.Tips to not get lost here: Decide one place as a spot to meet and make sure to take a picture. Save this picture in you mobile phone. When you get lost, find people with red hat and red vest who walk around the street, then show to them the picture you taken. They will guide you to find the place. "
Shopping,"many stores are selling homogenous products, therefore can accumulate and buy at one store to take advantage of bulk discounts and tax rebates"
Beauty-Product Shopping here is addicting!!!,"I has so much fun exploring this area. My hotel was very close so I get to experience Myeongdong in the early morning until night. A variety of street food from savory to sweet are available at night so you can take a break from cosmetic-shopping and sample Seoul's delicacies. And don't let me start talking about my loot!!!! I got different kind of sheet masks, ampoules, essense, creams, night mask and what have you. I literally filled my luggage with make up and beauty products.I will definitely come back. "
"Brightly lit, fun shopping area","Lots of bright lights here, shopping and street food. So fun to walk up and down these small streets...try some squid on a stick, some lobster with cheese or any one of the other dozens of street food on offer."
Go with a purpose,"Yes, the cosmetic and skincare products are everywhere and everything they said it will be. Affordable and good. But the service leave plenty to be desired. We walked into a few shops where the salesperson will give us a look and decide that we are not worthy of good service. Well, fret not if you experience such services for a few shops down you will find a similar shop who will be willing to serve you well. But still, such regular and frequent run in of bad services leave an unpleasant memories of the place. Would rather not go back as there are plenty of other streets to buy similar products."
Busy but fun!,"We stayed at Hotel Prince so we where very close to Myeongdong our first night was friday night the shooping area was VERY busy but there is plenty to do there. So many shops, and don't forget to try some street food. We stayed there for 7 days. "
Food And Shop,"Went on a cold evening but still enjoyed the walk. A variety of shops for everyone as well as sidewalk stores for souvenirs. Eat your way through the food stores, gastronomic. Could do with more bins"
Pamper the ladies,A cosmetic heaven for the ladies with lots of street foods and restaurants.A great shopping and eating place to pamper the ladies.
Cosmetics galore and night food street!,"Countless cosmetics shops that offer good bargains. You can easily get years of supply of facial masks, make up items here. There are also unique/new items you can't get anywhere else. It's like, be the first to own it! Many themed character items too, like power puff girls, the Line characters, Pokemon hand creams etc. The streets are lined with countless restaurants serving all types of Korean or international cuisines.At night food carts are found all around, selling BBQ seafood, pomegranate juice, dumplings, Korean potato snacks, fried noodles. Delicious to eat, nice to watch the preparation too. Prices are affordable. BBQ scallop with cheese cost 5000 KRW, sweet potato costs 3000KRW each while pomegranate juice cost 6000 KRW. Prices are the same across most stalls. "
Forget shopping. Go for the food!,"I pretty much have everything I need so I'm not much of a shopper. But I do like to eat from time to time, in fact, often as three times a day. Fishcakes, flame roasted clams and lobster, and a number of things of which I have no idea what I ate, are all available in spades. Go hungry, leave satiated, avoid the fancy stores and and return to your hotel none the poorer. "
Commercial. Tourists galore ,There are more tourists than locals. Every street and alley looks like the other. If you get lost pay attention to the stores.  Street food gets repetitive. Stores get repetitive. It was not exciting. Good for cheapest mainstream cosmetic products. Very overwhelmed. And no desire to visit again. 
Lively,lot of shops and eatery I love it at night ( specially it was cold ) and buying food at all these mobile trolleys ( great food street )closing quite late 
Similar to any other shopping area in Seoul,A lot of cosmatics shops and fashion shops. Plenty of road side food stores but price wise it's the same for all products across the whole area. 
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"If you are doing shopping in Seoul, Myeongdong Shopping Street provides you one of the competitive price. As it is a tourists attraction, I believe the items will be marked up in price. But this is not the case. Thus do not need to run all over Seoul to find the cheapest bag, socks etc. It is all here at Myeongdong Shopping Street"
Cosmetic & Street Food Parade.,"I love this place ! If you like shopping, you can find lots of Korean cosmetic brands (Etude, Face Shop, Tony Moly, etc) and international brands as well (H&M, Forever21, Adidas, Nike, Daiso etc) And don't miss their local street food, just idea : Please share in group, so you can try many local foods ! fresh strawberry mochi 2 for W 5,000 , steam lobster W 20,000, various sausages start from W 5,000 etc !I found cute socks, Korean style glasses and some cute souvenirs (which I realize that the souvenirs is cheaper in Myeongdong than other places)."
Shopping and shopping,"You can find all the Korean famous cosmetics brands, casual clothing brands and famous food jointsAlso close to Seoul Cathedral and Lotte DutyfreeIt's fun and you will want to come here when you are in Seoul "
Beauty products shopping,Great place for Korean beauty products bargain. All the major Korean brands are represented here. Just beware that the front sales can be aggressive in shoving free samples in making you enter their store. 
Street Shopping Mecca!,"The endless variety of shops made my wife truly happy, and the vast street food selections fascinated me! The pedestrian-only wide avenues get packed (surprisingly), yet the area is clean, with a festive atmosphere!"
Free and Easy & Nice Place to Shop and Eat,"You sure find something to buy with all the great stuff you see along the street. Affordable prices and nice stall holders who are ready to help. A must to visit, shop and eat street."

Loved this! Very popular,"This is an amazing place! So many shops, restaurants and street food. Many different kinds of shops and so many interesting side streets that you can go exploring in. This is clean and beautifully decorated. A must do for tourists. "
"Myeongdong shopping is busy, busy","After a good dinner at Amiso (3F Poraris Bldg., 53-1, Myeong-dong 2-ga, Jung-gu), wandered Myeongdong on a Friday night. What a hoot; stalls lined both sides of the main shopping street selling all kinds of food, mostly on skewers, from lobster to fried cheese, as people milled and meandered from kiosk to kiosk, sampling this or that. Stores were open late and the cosmetics/skin care stores (there are many) were crowded. Temperatures were low, so need to bundle up in Dec., but a fun place to people watch."
A shopping street great for ladies,The shopping street comes to live in the evening.There are so many shops selling cosmetic and stuff for ladies. If you want to impress your wife or partner this is the place to be.There are also street food stalls selling almost the same things. If you are not keen there are also many restaurant.A good place to visit in the evening.
Shopping and eating!!,"Shopping district with a wide range of products and genres, from established higher end brands to cheaper local products. There's a night street market selling quite a lot of food too, good way to wind up the day after a long day! Recommended area to stay due to the convenience! There's quite a few accommodation areas nearby."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Great place to shop and according to my daughter the best place to shop she has found. Prices very cheap, quality very good and the area is clean and safe.Also if you have hassles there are information persons who speak a variety of languages to help."
Good shopping place with many local snack along the street,"Many shopping and food palaces, both with big malls and small shops, easy to buy stuff and dine there. There are supermarket too. People could stay there for whole day."
Street that never rest,"We visited this street almost everyday, even at different time of the day, it is really busy.A lot of happening here.The LINE cafe/shop is a long q to take picture with its character (bear). Kid will have never endingwanting of stationary and stuff.Mainly there is plenty of walking, seeing and buying here.There are plenty of food outlet here, new release of retail stuff will be here.It is a street where vehicle can also move around, so keep kids close.Overall worth visiting, plan for a whole day here."
Too pricy,I visited this place at night. All the store is cosmetic and the price quite different with same store at different location. The food stall in here so expensive. The different price around 500-1000 won.
Walk and shop till you drop!,"Whichever one prefers, it's a recommended stop. Big stores, small stores of all variety. Lots of eating places of any style. After 5, the street food venders come out serving anything from lobster tail, grilled abalone, octopus, bake goods, skewers,etc......Reachable by subway.Attended a famous theatre show there called "" NANDA "" very entertaining and recommended."
The mecca of korean skincare shops,Best place to get korean skincare and makeup products. Promoters would hand out free samples (usually masks or facial cotton packs) to lure potential shoppers. There are a couple of cat cafes & dig cafes too and the largest uniqlo store. 
"Glasses, clothes, food","Effectively a bunch of streets, covered in foodstalls and people. The stores cover many items. Focus seems to be on clothes, glasses and personal hygiene products. Spend a few hours."
Neat shopping district,"Myeongdong shopping district is a delightful, modern, upscale shopping district that offers high-end shopping to low-end bargain stores where one can find a broad array of merchandise, food and entertainment to some degree, although this is not an entertainment district per se. One can find great bargains and inexpensive good food, or one can spend high-end and choose more upscale dining. Hotels are integrated in the shopping district, too. There also are cobblestone streets and churches to visit. The shopping district often has street entertainers that enhances one's experience as they work themselves through the district. It is a large geographic area. The Myeongdong shopping experience is an experience you will remember and take home with you."
Shopping !! ,"Vibrant place to soak in bazaar atmosphere! Street food and fashion aplenty! And Cosmetics shops!!! Everywhere! The sales staff speaks korean and Mandarin, some English. "
best place for tourists shopping,"I love Myeong dong shopping street. It is easy to access by metro. It also has everything you are interested, wide range of products and services. You can also get tax refund at some shops as well."
Splendid,"Wide variety of goods and many renowned brands are here. Possibly most of the ""to buy"" list of goods are available here. When night comes, the street is filled with mobile traders and serving tasty street food and many handy merchandise. Lotte shopping centre are just nearby and if you like the proper and branded stuffs, do drop by."
I love to shop!,"Great market stalls however some prices aren't cheap. There are however large wholesale shops so if you're buying in bulk definitely recommend going into them. In th street markets I wanted to purchase some key ring fluffy rabbits, cost in the market was $14,000 (won) for 1 and $3,000 (won) each but I did need to buy at least 7, which is what I needed anyway, so saved so much money. Most of the items in the wholesalers are out in the street markets so go save some money in their - heaps of jewellery too but most places you'll need to buy 10+ items.Loved all the different types of food stalls - from the amazing huge ice cream for just $2,000 won, huge smashing balls, giant meatballs plus another dish which I'm not sure on the name but it's like a small sweet pancake for $1,000 - definitely wish I had more of these, one just wasn't enough!"
Razzle-dazzle ,"If you are in Seoul you cannot miss this place!!! It was designated as UNESCO street in 2010 for a reason! Delicious street food, shops, bars, market - all that razzle-dazzle plus Christmas lights!We loved it!!! "
Shopping area and food,"Street food is overpriced and not that good. Except for the Strawberries it costs around 7000 to 10000 krw. It's very sweet and fresh. It's Cheaper if you buy the one sold in a cup for just 3000 to 5000 krw. Shop in artbox if you like cute and unique stuff. Holika Holika, etude, innisfree, the face shop is almost in every corner. After shopping go to Myeongdong Kyoja. Hands down serve they serve the best dumpling! "
shopping,shopping and great street food. It is recommended for everyone who is visiting Seoul. Good access to the train . Lot of american and European as well.
busy crowded and amazing place,"go there not to buy, but to observe young generation. great atmosphere, don't hesitate to try food street, always spicy and great share with friends"
Popular tourist spot for cosmetic and food,"A popular spot for tourist and also a personal go-to for me whenever I visit Seoul. Has a broad range of cosmetic brands such as innisfree, Laniege, faceshop etc. Remember to bring your passport for instant tax refund over the counter (for selected brands).Street food are delicious and usually starts to open around evening, although on weekends they are mostly up at noon. There are other restaurants too deeper inside. "
Fantastic place to shop and eat street food,Lots of facial products and good local & street food. Fav is the flame grill lobster which cost abt 15k won
Cosmetics shopping,"Similar to shopping areas in China and Singapore, the streets are lined with exotic food on carts, and its so crowded that its hard not to bump into other people. The area is famous for good quality cosmetics. Bought lots of stuff from Nature Republic."
"Busy, Bright, Vibrant","This is exactly what I expected street shopping in Korea to be like! The shops, vendors and food stalls were amazing. You are surrounded by the sights and smells of Korea! Have the mondu!"
Food trip and shopping ,"One of my favorite places in Seoul! Enjoyed eating street food, shopping for small trinkets and just walking around trying out new things. Will always drop by this street whenever I will return to Seoul. I cannot wait to go back. Food is clean and hygienic ( for those that I tried eating) "
Cosmetics Heaven,Be sure to spot the guides and get a map! Rows and rows of similar brands shops will make one giddy and lost! Get free samples by just visiting the shop even if it is window shopping! There are loads of street food come evening time but they are overpriced for the tourists so save your money and eat elsewhere.
"Don't have Korean ""taste""","Why am say so as above subject? Cox 90 percent of the shop we went have promoters from main land China. It's good idea to have them becox of China tourist a lot nowadays however the customer service need to be polish a lot. Rude, disrespectful and very pushie which have no chance for customer to walk around the shop see another options. Understand this is the communication way between them (China & China) but as in service industry especially in tourist sport like Myeondong the promoters have to treat others Chinese not from China in another way. Because Singapore, Malaysia and others Chinese are not been communicated this way which for us this way of communication is very rude. Because of this， the whole Myeondong can't see much on Korean type of culture. Great Xmas déco and foods a around. So keep it up. Will visit Myeondong again but try not to engage with those rude promoters. "
Night Market fun!,"I would only visit at night as the street is lined with vendors, mostly of food, which makes it fascinating and fun. It is a place to be in Seoul at night--so the streets will be crowded. The shops are mainly for cosmetics and skin care items which are so different than what we have in the USA. But there are also some other types of shops and many places to eat. Just a fun place to be in the evening. Go!! Seems to stay open until about 11 or 1130 PM."
Happy shopping,"Paradise for shoppers so many fantastic goods ... clothes,shoes,woman apparel,make up kits,electronics and many... It's makes me crazy to bring all the items... Myeongdong is a great place for shopping ... "
Nice shopping district,We visited myeongdong twice as we find that this is one of the best shopping district in Seoul. Lots of nice street food and beauty products. It's also located just opposite Lotte shopping center. There were nice restaurants in the area too. Only thing is that there isn't rubbish bin around. We later learnt that you can actually asked the stall which you buy the food from to throw the rubbish into their own bin. Will definitely visit Myeongdong again when we visit Seoul. 
Shop? Eat?Shop! Eat!,"Must, must, must shop, eat, and shop and eat. For me I had prawns on a skewer from the Shrimp King, 10 pairs of socks for the kids for a $1 each, Banana and Nutella crepe and I think you get the idea!!! Enjoy it all!!! I "
"Eat, Shop, Relax!","Was advised to visit Myeongdong as it is very suitable for young and trendy stuffs. Came here with family at late morning and find it easy to move around. By 3pm, all the carts were out and as it get later to the evening, the streets were bustling with great life and energy. Can easily pick up street food along the way and shop at the same time. Can find resting point or cafes to relax when tired. "
All what you want,"This is just like Causeway Bay in Hong Kong with all the shops you can imagine in one area. Ladies' paradise with skin care shops taking over 50% of the retail space, rest for fashion, food and massage salons. One can literally stay here the whole day.More, the street food is so good comparable to those night markets in Taiwan."
Crazy shopping!,"This place somewhat requires a little bit of being physically fit. So many places to shop around, so my piece of advice would be to specify the list of what you are gonna buy, and get to the places of that specific interest. Otherwise one will be terribly tired after so much walking from place to place )))"
Great atmosphere,"Myeongdong is bustling with tourists and some locals all throughout the day and into the night; it has a great atmosphere, numerous stores (clothing and shoes are pretty good value) and fantastic street food. The food stalls are quite clean and many of the options cannot be found outside of Korea and are definitely worth a try."
Ladies delight,"A trip to Seoul is incomplete without a visit to Myeongdong. Ladies will go wild once unleash upon Myeongdong. I saw with my own eyes, ladies of different ages, lighting up when we got there. Ladies' products aka cosmetics of brands alien to most guys can be found here. This place is worth your time if shopping is on your list. You can see people walking in light, coming out with baggage on wheels courtesy of the merchants for buying just too much. I guess the price is more than right. Happy shopping here. "
Exciting as Ever,"Place is crowded as always with interesting items on sale. There are lots of food and merchandise, with plenty of shoppes and shopping to do - clothes, bags, socks, souveniers, belts, toys, etc. Sellers are nice and cheerful. "
Shopping paradise,"For the male, they basically find a nice cafe place to sit down and drink coffee. But shopping paradise for females. Plenty of cosmetic shops, fashion outlets. "
A surprise,"Am never into street food but this experience was completely different. The area is very clean, orderly and well kept so I believe the food is safe to eat. Enjoyed a variety but my favorite was the the pancake in the shape of a fish with red bean paste. "
Pretty much a tourist trap,"Lots and lots of shops that are pretty much the same in every corner of myeongdong. Make up, shoes, clothes of the same brand alternating. Super lively. Shop assistants here usually also speak chinese and japanese too and even Thai in some shops. These people are used to foreigners so it might be a bit easier to buy stuffs here than say make up store booth in the subway. Mind you that they usually sell things in pack of like a dozen e.g. Masks unless you ask for singles. I also find that when shopping for cosmetics go for the one further away from the main myeongdong road; less pushy, more friendly. Street food after sun down. Beware of people trying to drag you into shops. It could be just a make up store or some sketchy premises. "
Shopping galore,"Every kind of shopping you can imagine. High end, low end and in the middle. Plenty of cosmetics and street food."
Tons of street food and shopping,"This is a large shopping area, mostly focused on cosmetic products. There are bigger stores like Nike, Adidas, and H&M, but many smaller stores for just cosmetic products. I found it odd that many of the cosmetic stores had multiple stores in the area - Innisfree, Skinfood, Toly Moly - all have multiple stores, selling the same products, spread out so it feels none are more than a block away from each other. The streets are packed and sometimes cars seem to slowly move through the crowds, since they streets aren't officially closed off for most of the area. At night, there is a lot of street food available, which is always great. During the day, most of the vendors are not present but there are still a few street food stalls open. It gets really packed at night. The area has a lot of restaurants as well and many different cafes that you can duck into to get away from the crowds. This is a great shopping destination for those interested in cosmetic products, but at night is worth a visit to anyone looking for street food."
Shopping heaven,Shopping heaven for those who cant afford such an expensive things like me... You can do both shopping and eat the food street. 
Shopping Paradise," In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that includes a lot of culture, arts and music. Once you mentioned Seoul, you must think of Myeongdong---which is a famous tourist attraction that gathers all sorts of delicious food, fashion shops and cosmetic brands. As we all know, cosmetic industry is very famous and vital all over the world. People are also keen on the products. So you can find a lot of cosmetic brands whatever you need. Sometimes there are too many choices that enables you dazzling. Like Etude House, innisfree, clio and so on. I like here cuz the price here are much cheaper than I buy in China. It is really very substantial. It is a shopping paradise. I advise that the people who want to go to Myeongdong need to make a shopping list in advance in order to buy all the things you want."
Just another shopping street,"Nice shopping street with numerous shops selling clothing, shoes, beauty shops..etc. basically all shops sells almost the same stuffs"
Great shopping area!,"This is one shopping haven when you're in Seoul. Best for beauty shopping, food tripping and clothes shopping too.There's a lot of cheap finds and the currency exchange is also good in this area."
Fantastic,"This is truly the place for the shopkaholic. As an Asian girl, I did have lots of joy going around this area. All the shops are so nice with kind and cute staffs. The street food is a bit expensive though :D"
Shopping and street food Paradise,"I spent 2 days at this place to shop for cosmetics. It is a place where ladies could go crazy and maybe missing in this area. There is also alot of street food too. I purposely spare my tummy space to have my ""dinner"" there. I would suggest you to do the same too. "
Great place to shop for local cosmetics but too many people,"It is definitely worth checking out Myengdong if you are interested in buying local Korean brad cosmetics. You have to do your homework on what you want to get because there are really TOO many options to choose from and you need to shop with a list. Most of the stores repeat several times so don't worry if you haven't gotten something, most likely you will see the same brand store several more times in the area. While there, check out the Lotte Department store, they have Duty Free shopping on floors 8-9. One very used tip is that Google maps doesn't work in Korea so don't rely on finding a route using it."
Kaleidoscope ! ,"Reminiscent of Shinjuku in Tokyo & Causeway Bay in HK. Lots & lots of shops (many repetitive!) but give me Ewha University any time. And if you are too cold to walk above ground, go underground shopping !! Lots & Lots of street food but give me Namdaemun any time. "
Shopping overload,"If you are into shopping, then this area is for you. Personally i avoid going here unless i have specific item that is cheap here. The area is way too crowded with mainland chinese tourists which for me ruins the whole shopping experience. Several big malls in the area and streetfood is also available. Skip this area if you are not into shopping."
Good place to shop,It is a nice place to shop in Seoul as you find a lot of stuff here. But you have to bargain a bit for the best deal. 
A whole new world,Be prepared to shop. Lots and lots of beauty shops (a lot can be accessed in many places around korea anyway) a lots of cafes also to take rest breaks. Best time is after dark when the street vendors set up with lots of different street food and other merchandise. Awesome for those last minute souvenirs or gifts also. 
Upmarket shopping,"This is the uptown area for shopping. The lights at night and the street vendors make this vibrant and fun. Look out for the cat cafe, where you can take tea with cats. "
Fantastic Street Food,"We need two days to try all their local street food. There are speciality cafes like cat cafe and dog cafe etc.There are many cosmetics & skin product store where many Chinese speaking sales will patiently explain each product in detail. Remember to request for on the spot tourist tax refund in cash and also free gifts. You can also request for a free luggage with min spending.Finally, wear comfortable walking shoes."
Vegas on steriods,"If you are from the states ull understand why it reminds me of vegas. They have people on the streets giving u ""free"" stuff if you go into the stores. There are like 3 or 4 of the same stores on one block. But i still went in everyone of them. Lol. They have good deals but bring your wallet because ive found the fountain of youth but its gonna cost u. Lol. They say korean skincare is the best so i threw all my money away for the best lotions n creams with gold flecks in them. Lol not only does it have good shopping but ooh it has good food everywhere. We stayed in chungmuro and walked here everyday for food. Mmm, still dreaming about that andong jimdak. Which is a must try!! Ladies go check it out n bring ur mans wallet. "
Super place for shopping and street food,"This street and the area is great for shopping fashion and cosmetics. It is a bit repetitive though, which is a shame. Many of the brands have a multitude of shops with exactly the same products.It does get very crowded and loud. The people stand outside their shops and shout at you in a variety of languages to try to get you to come inside their shop. Can be a bit tiring.When evening comes the food trolleys are everywhere and you can find lots of different tasty street food. There are also plenty of restaurants in the area."
Shopping Mecca!,"SoKor cosmetics shops left and right. If you missed to drop by one shop, worry not coz for sure you'll see the same store the next corner. No shortage of street food at night. Tip: Look for the steak kiosk near Zara.. you can get your steak for 6,000won. "
Visit at the evening,"There are many food stalls opened from the evening in the Shopping Street in Myeongdong that offers a different variety of food such as cakes, fried chicken, grill steak and lobsters, Korean local food etc. Visit during early evening and you can enjoy shopping as well as dining at the same time. There are also many Korean restaurants in the area where you can dine comfortably. Remember to visit the Lotte Department Store opposite. The currency exchange near the Chinese embassy also offers good exchange rates. In short, one place for shopping and good food."
Vibrant,"Great atmosphere after 4pm when the traders set up. So many shops, restaurants etc. Everything from high end to low and everything in between. Great fun. Lots of walking but easily done. Pleanty of good street food."
shopping paradise,"visited the place in early november 2016i cant remember the countless times that i pulled out my wallet in Myeongdong.. there are lots of kpop related items, facial products, high end streetwear (MCM), food, etc.. i literally spent my entire day here. i swear there must be some magic going on in Myeongdong on attracting all the shoppers.. ^ ^""i even had to change extra currency while shopping the area and I cant rem the exact location of the moneychanger as it was my first time and Myeongdong is literally a maze to explore! But it was dubbed as the best place to convert your home currency to korean won, e.g. elsewhere was 1 SGD = 816 won, whereas this place gave 820 won."
Local goods + international brand at good price,"Easily access by bus from gangnam, just 2 bus. Many stores selling local brand, i need a day to walk around this shopping streets. There is crowded castella store, i dont like it very much but i dont know ehy people like it very much"
Shopping paradise,Most all Korean make up brands have stores here. Vibrant atmosphere with food stalls selling delicious snacks. Good place to get souvenirs.
Fun,"Roaming the streets and checking the local street food is so fun, u wont get bored doing it for days. So many options and cheap shopping "
Another visit,The first snow for 2016 came yesterday amidst the candlelight demonstration for their President to step down.It was cold and walking in the open was challenging for people loke us used to near equator weather.As usual the street is basking with street stores selling from food to drinks to all kind of accessories. It is cosmetics galore from a wide range of brands attracting all the ladies from everywhere.One of the must visit place when in Seoul.
Great Shopping- Mix of designer and local brands and shops,It's the most popular shopping district in Seoul and I see why. You can find popular brands here as well as small shops and stalls that sell anything korean. The street food stalls are awesome though i found out that it is a bit pricey compared to other areas in Seoul. I have never found such a line up of street stalls though than what i saw in Myeongdong so I guess there is premium to pay there. The fired up cheese lobster was expensive for street food but hey its lobster and its yummy! We went during winter and winter jackets abound! I just had to buy one! :)
Touristy,Of course everyone goes to Myeongdong when they visit seoul. It's a popular walking street with throngs of rowdy tourists. It can be overpowering at times. I enjoyed a casual evening eating street food and buying some cosmetics. Lots of free samples to collect but be prepared to brave the crowds and pushy sales people. Don't expect quality food. 
Good,Good and not very good.. a nice plave to everyone but some things are so much expensive than the other places like dongdaemon and namdaemon
Not to be missed ,What a fab afternoon we had here around the lovely shopping streets and street food. The bonus for us was it's all decorated up for Christmas which made it more special and there was street food everywhere. Prices of items on stalls either for clothes or food were very cheap. Highly recommend a visit here while in Seoul.
Happening Place,"A must-visit. Be prepared to spend some time to browse the shops, and lots of eating places too. Interesting food stalls with traditional Korean foods. Night scene is exciting too. "
Something for everyone ,"The street extends for a long walk having shops on both sides with a taste for everyone.Brands, Korean brands, counterfeit products and local hand made products are all available with a wide variety of prices to serve everyone.Beware of counterfeits and strangers walking you into back shops.Restaurants from around the world so you won't have a problem with food, you might even end up eating your favorite hometown food."
NON-STOP BUSTLE,"The shopping mecca of Seoul with many eateries, retail shops, mini marts & in the evening many food carts add to the festive & bustling atmosphere.Real happening place !"
Business,"Was in Korea for a business trip, had to squeeze in a trip to Myeongdong shopping street ! Must go for all tourists.Many interesting street food stalls (halal ones : kebab , ding dang sweet) which serve up a variety of street food (I only tried the halal ones and the cheese lobster ,banana chocolate crepe, cuttlefish), great for hungry stomachs when your shopping in the winter cold. There's also a few halal restaurants, Potala and another one at ground floor near Potala always with long queues of Muslims(can't remember the name offhand), selling hotpot and traditional Korean food. Best place to shop for cosmetics ! And for trendy street clothes and shoes. Only thing is the things are as expensive as Singapore , so not for those who like to cut a bargain. Overall, a must see in Seoul! "
Variety Goods ,I am okay with Myeongdong. There are a lot of streets foods and shops both from korea brand and oversea brand that you can choose. 
A shopper's paradise,"An all-in-one shopping paradise. Almost everything a tourist shopper could ever want can be found here: street food, cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc. I could visit again and again and not get tired of Myeongdong!As this is a prime shopping area, it will be crowded. Avoid weekend nights if possible."
Local food and shopping!!!,"Lots of local street food and shopping. Street food is only available in the afternoon and there are may selection.If you want local food in the restaurant, please go to small alleyway instead of the main street as it is cheaper. Most restaurants have English menu."
Best shopping place ever ,"I love this place. Come here more than 5times but everyday i have to finish my day here. Shopping, food and people. I love myeongdong and also the department store called lotte is awesome. Recommend to visit guys ! "
Great shopping area for clothes.,"This area has a lot of wholesale type of clothing. There were also many nice shopping centers. Many stands, shops were open till the wee hours of the morning."
Fashion and street food haven in Seoul,Definitely our favorite place in Seoul...the shopping spree and great street foods will make your day when you viait this wonderful place... 
Good place to shop has expensive and more affordable stores ,"Good place to shop in the day time with affordable shops and the higher end shops as well, a very tourist area, good night streets food,plenty of restaurant and coffee shops around."
Busy shopping district for cosmetics,"Stayed in this area and it's really busy - good if you love to shop and in particular, for cosmetics and loads and loads of masks. There are some good eateries in this area - from porridge, ginseng chicken soup and dumplings - Starbucks and other cafes are easily spotted too - so you can rest and eat and rest again as and when you wishGood place to visit for your shopping desires. "
Must visit if you only have time to visit one place for facial products,"The entire street is basically lined with shops selling different facial products, e.g. Face shop, innisfree, laneige, etc. As most of the shops can do tax rebates immediately so it's saves time and effort at the airport subsequently. There are also shops selling the latest street fashion so you can also check in on latest accessories and clothes. There are also lots of streetfood so it may be good to go with an empty stomach and eat along the streets! "
shopping,"plenty to shop and lots to eat. Very interesting night market with lots of hawkers food stall. Always full of people walking up and down the streets and alleys, but be aware of occasion traffic. It is no vehicle free zone."
Get your wallet ready!,"This a really nice area where you have unlimited options, from getting a new pair of jeans, the latest trends in sneakers, traditional street food to beauty products.This is a must do when visiting Korea, just don't forget that you could be easily spending more than you planned."
Touristy but it's a Got-To-Do kinda place,"Myeongdong is super touristy, eve in the day with all the skicare and fashion shops - not the cheapest and definitely lots of repetition. Once the food stalls come out, it's a smorgasbord of omnomnom-ing your way down steamed egg buns, cheesy grilled scallops and refreshing pressed pomegranate juice, to name a few. Generally cheaper in Dongdaemum and other less hyped up areas."
Heaps of good things to try out,"Easy access and good for last minute shopping! Lots of good street food too! Tried out Hotteok and Odeng on a cold and breezy evening last week and instantly felt warmer. Try visiting in the afternoon if you want a less crowded area. Tip! Do explore the other alleys when you go cosmetics shopping. Sometimes they have the biggest sales, promos and free samples. Once we were dragged at Holika Holika by their staff (we didn't intend to go inside), but we found the greatest deal in our vacation inside that store. 50 pieces of Facial Mask worth 20,000 won.We went to the other Holika, Holika store on another day, but they only have the 20 masks for 20,000 won promo."
shopping heaven,"I thought if I went to Korea again, i will go there Myeongdong shopping Street.There are many different kinds of shop in there also there are some food stalls and the food was very delicious. I thought if people like to make up,they may be crazy because there are many shop that sold make up product also the clerks can speak Chinese that can help you to find the product that you want, there are many discount in this Street, we spent two days and bought many things. If you feel tired, you can just find a shop to eat water ice or drink a cup of drink, that water ice was very delicious.The Shopping Street was too big even though we spent two days, we still can not go everywhere in the Street, I think if you like shopping that you may be crazy and happy in the Myeongdong shopping Street."
"Must see, but becoming a more of a show.","Chestnuts, for example are premade. Their tossing and turning of chestnuts is purely for show. We asked for unpeeled chestnuts they were tossing around and they said they were not for eating."
one stop shopping heaven for visitors,"Myeongdong shopping street is a must stop for newcomer or tourists no matter how many hours you got. You definitely enjoy your seoul trip for yourself and your family for sure. Shopping, Eating, Souvenir, Relax, Chilling time all right here in Myeondgong How to go: Myeongdong station line4 (Blue color) exit 6,7,8,9 Limousine bus from airport : 6015 "
An interesting place to see and for good shopping,"This is a very interesting place for seeing traditional products and to find what you want to bring to your country.There are many things of different kind, food, traditional artifacts, clothing, souvenirs, etc, etc.This open shopping is near Sungnyemun Gate, an interesting place for a visit."
Shopping Paradise!,"I went to South Korea with my classmates for our graduation trip. Many people recommend us to go Myeongdong Shopping Street before our trip because they know we are all shopaholic. It is really a shopping paradise with enormous things to buy, like cosmetics, clothing, and accessories. Many shops are having discounts to attract customers to buy, the sales are passionate and friendly, they are kind to answer our queries. Aside from shopping, there are many Korean cuisines like Korean coffee shops, Korean barbecue restaurant, and Korean street food which are delicious and characterized. Moreover, if you still not shop enough, you can do more shopping in the underground and shopping malls nearby. If you buy at a certain amount or above, tourist can enjoy tax-refund. Myeongdong Shopping Street provides Chinese translators and the sales know Chinese well, so language difference is not a problem. Thus, it is a place with many things to do, things to buy, and things to eat. I will suggest you to wear comfortable shoes because you will feel tired after whole day shopping."
Comestics heaven,"If you are crazy about latest makeup trends in Korean/Asian, should be a good stop to test out the products. Likely you can find the same brands every 200 metres so dont' worry if you can't decide to buy on the spot"
Food stalls everywhere!,"Just because I was curious about this area, I headed for Myeongdong to find out what it was all about. I do not know about the stores, which seem to be like in any other place. But the main attraction (or distraction) seem to be the food stalls. I did not find all of them cheap. In all, the combination of stores and food on the street was too weird to my taste. How do you find stores selling beauty product with such amount of food on the streets? Not my cup of tea."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,We have been to Seoul before and Myeongdong has always been the most frequently place to loitering around when in Seoul. You can basically find all comestic products and with lots of street foods available. Must visit.
Teens love the 2 foot tall soft icecream cone at Myeongdong market,"This is close to Myeongdong subway station and is a must with teens for their snapchat. Mine had to go to get snapped indulging in the famous 2 foot tall soft ice cream cone in different flavours. You can pick vanilla, chocolate or green tea. Lots of restaurants and shops there too. Great for a sunny afternoon out,"
"Shops, Shops, and Street Food","Definitely a great shopping area in Seoul. The streets themselves are lined with many different stores- mostly beauty product or skin care stores. The streets themselves are also blocked off from automobile traffic, so the sidewalks are cluttered with more vendors and street food. There are also sit-down restaurants, if that is more your style (it is mine!)The street vendors mostly sold shirts, purses, and so many socks. Once you think you've seen it all, go underground to a subway entrance (or even just an underground mall) and see even more shops! What surprised me was the abundance of the same brand within the shopping center.I'd say that dusk to night is a more exciting time to visit. The streets are very crowded, and there are many noises and lights to keep you occupied. Myeongdong is worth it to check out, even if you aren't planning on purchasing anything."
Food Street!,"If you love food, should come to here ! A lot of good street food can get from here ! Nearby also have shopping Malls. for shopping, please be careful when shopping. Was advice by my tour guide that if you found some shop only allow foreigner to buy.... you know what to do. anyway, here a lot of things can buy such as cheap bag !"
Shopping,"If you are keen on cosmetics and masks - this is THE place to go to. Here, you are spoilt for choice."
Wonderful street food,"All your shopping needs, from street to department stores to supermarket.But the wonderful stuff is the street food. Give them all a try and skip a meal. Yums."
Lots to shop,"What a paradise for walking, snacking, shopping and repeating. Lots of shops, very well known and more not so. You have to try the Korean porridge!"
Where the action is at night,"Yes, there are plenty of small shops in this location where you can shop for clothes, cosmetics, etc. The streets are brightly lit up at night. And even on a weekday night late at night, there are plenty of people around so that you can enjoy the hustle and bustle.However, I feel the main attraction here was the street food. Unlike Gwangjang market which serves the same few dishes of street food (dumplings, rice cakes, etc.), this market serves a large variety of street food which makes it a little more interesting than Gwangjang. The vendors are quite clean and there are many, many options ranging from Western inspired options to Korean. Definitely a must try when you get there."
"Overcrowded, and too noisy","I have been to Myeongdong many times while living in Korea and as much as you will find a lot of things there; you must be willing to deal with a ton of people, as well as flashing lights everywhere and people shouting things in Korean; Chinese and Japanese. "
SHOPPING ALLEYS,"This place is a cosmetic heaven alley from Innisfree ,Nature Republic,Holika,Etude House and many more of housebrand and street stalls foodie from grilled,fried and sweets. Theres also shoes and clothing shops around and street vendor cart selling clothes,hats,shawls,earrings,bags. Most shops here are repeated. Cafes around too. Money changer available around here. Very crowded and happening place. Must remember from which entrance you enter eg: if you exit from Myeondong Station make sure you remember the right way to go back to the right station otherwise the train Lines may not be the same. fyi theres underground mall shops at Myeondong Station selling clothes,shoes,hats,k- pop stuffs,bags and accesories. "
Great place for shopping and street food.,"Trust me, lots of shops everywhere selling everything, a good place for tasting street foods and local restaurants.Myeongdong Shopping Street is a must visit at least once for tourist."
Foodie,"This area is for the shopaholics! Both fashion & cosmetics are everywhere! But for us, we enjoyed the foodies the most! The street foods are at it's best! A large variety of local foods to choose from. Most of them are a bit spicy that makes it more interesting & complimenting the cold weather! This place is much busier during night time & weekends. A must see when in Seoul! "
lots of cosmetics and street fod,"This is the place to go if you want to buy cosmetics. The same company will have multiple stores though. At night, you will find a lot of street food vendors (although a lot of them will sell the same thing). It gets busier on Friday nights. There is also a big Uniqlo. "
Deebak!,"Oh i love the place... U can try the street food here and dont worry it was clean... Lots of thing to shop...korean made, good quality tho a bit pricey... Overall i like the place!"
Great place for street food,This open air market had everything you could think of. Shopping for blocks. The best part was the great street food.
"All things shopping in Myeongdong Shopping Street in Seoul, South Korea","Very alive and crowded by day and by night. Food, clothing, cosmetics and anything else you can think of. There are many street vendors too. Many of the high street local and international brands are here. Very much worth at least an hour long walk around."
Lots of food and shopping ,"Plenty of street food but expensive. Tons of clothing and cosmetic/skincare stores. Also found a place all you can eat pork belly BBQ for dinner for 11000 won per person. Great deal, good food."
A must see!,"LOTS of people everywhere, no matter if it's day or evening. Be prepared to walk extremely slow in large crowds! But it's still a must do in Seoul! Lots of shops everywhere selling everything."
Street food trip and shopping ,Must try and explore in budge allowance. Keep coming back. Underground vinyl is amazing and recommended to collectors 
Cosmetics and beauty products street,Lots of discounts and free gifts given along the street. Plenty of good deals. You may spend whole day here as long as you are not tired. 
Shop and eat,"The are SO MANY cosmetic and skin care shop around there is women paradise , there are plenty of food shop as well , me and my friends have tried so many different kind of food , is a shopping and food paradise!!!!"
"Overpriced Street foods, Big discounts on Cosmetic","My Family and I actually enjoyed Myeongdong especially during shopping of Make-ups and masks, discounts are everywhere! Street Foods were overpriced like the Fish stew which costs Krw 1,000/each but you can buy it out of Myeongdong Area at only Krw 600-700. The redbeanpaste Fish called Bungeoppang only cost krw 1,000/3pcs but in Myeongdong it costs Krw 3,000/each. Street foods ranges from Krw 1,000 to 14,000. This is very busy during the night."
Cosmetics and skin care!,"Love this place! Apart from cosmetics and skin care, there was so much delicious street food! The eateries are good too. "
"For those who need to shop, eat","Myeongdong for shoppers. Many tourists from china who seem to empty the shelves of popular products. Skincare shops at every street and turn, same-brand shops can be found meters away from each other. Eateries, food streets, subway, bus services, all conveniently found here. Myeongdong cathedral, and UNESCO building to catch the Nanta Show were our to-do things on this trip. Did not disappoint. Tour ambassadors who speak English (plus other languages?) on hand with to assist. "
Shop till you drop!,"You wouldnt think the world economy is going through a tough time when you are here. Everyone is buying, man & women! From clothes, bags, accessory, skincare products to snacks & different price range to suit your budget.There are also plenty of eateries, cafe, restaurants which are usually on 2nd Floor, or on the fringe of Myeongdong & tuck in small alley. I would avoid those with touter which are usually seafood & BBQ place.The supermarkets are all undergrounds, and if you only have a few moments, head for the supermarket cos they have all the must buy snacks & beauty care products including masks at much cheaper price than the actual stores. My advice is to bring extra foldable luggage such as Longchamp. We came with two half filled XL luggage & went back fully filled &2 XL Longchamp fully expanded! But everyone else have 2x more!"
shopping street,"Mostly cosmetic shop at this are and is cosmetic lover paradise. But beware, the price is different although same brand at different shop. "
Shop til you drop,"Needless to say, very popular spot for shopping and eating your hearts out. I shopped like crazy. Try to combine your shopping together with your friends and family in one shop, the more discount you will have and free samples!"
Best place to shop,They are open till 11pm. Best place to get all your cosmetics stuffs and streets food. Spend about 2hrs roaming around.
Korean street shopping at its best!,"Lots of variety from clothes, souvenirs, face masks (and more face masks and lots of... yes! FACE MASKS!) I have never seen so much variety of ... face masks and skin care products. Korean food, branded and imitation products, toys, everything under the sun. A bit pricey to be honest, even the most simplest of stuff. At night it transforms into night market so more food, more variety."
Stellar shopping ,A must visit shopping district in Seoul. If you can't find it here you most likely don't need it. Extremely busy on weekends and weekdays aren't much better but it will be well worth the shoulder to shoulder foot traffic to experience this place. 
Awesome,"Very love the place, and really crowded never mind that..suitable for women whose like mask and makeup..you can go there through subway, myeongdong station and exit 6 or 3 if not mistaken..the market open untill over midnight "
Merry Myeongdong!!!,"Great place to be in, walk around and shop shop shop!!! Nice combination of Name Brands fused with Street type stuff (yes food too!).Glad we booked in Hotel in the heart of this ""must-visit"" area when in Seoul!!!"
A great place to shop for branded goods,"It is a shopping area for people who is interested to get branded goods. This area is selling goods at higher ends so the price of foods and drinks are more expensive at a result. Unfortunately, the shops here are repetitive (esp skincare and cosmetic) to certain extent that you can find a few within 5 minute walk."
Must Go Market Place,You can do double shopping of Branded Item or Non-Branded item in just one street.. You can also try local from from the hawkers or in medium rate coffee shops in also in one street
Shopaholic haven,you can get pretty much everything and anything here on this street. lots of food choices too. beauty product shops are endless here. make sure you have unlimited budget.
Great Place to shop,If your looking for beauty product this is the place to go for. literally every shop there selling beauty product. they also have other things too..
Shopping paradise,"you can find all popular korea beauty cosmetic fashion brand here, and there are repeatable along the street. "
Has become too touristy,Large tour groups flood the streets and is no longer the fun place that Seoulites go. I lived in Seoul for 6 years and have watched this once fun place turn into a tourist trap. No longer for locals. 
What a place!,"It was a Saturday evening when we visited while thousands of demonstrators were on the streets of Seoul, protesting against their president. It was crowded and festive with all the lights of the food stands and nearby stores. You can practically fill your tummy with every Korean delicacy being cooked and prepared on this street. Plenty of opportunities for picture taking. Bring along your camera and appetite."
Touristy High Street Shopping For The Young,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is full of tourists. It is a good place to buy Korean branded cosmetics and to sample local street food. There are two underground shopping malls but I would not recommend to spend too much time in these two dated malls. If you have the cash to splash, you can go to the luxury Lotte Dept Store. If you love fashion, there are more interesting places to shop and to look at youth and Korean pop culture. Hongdae for youth culture. Sinsa dong for more fashionable and pricey fashion. And you will like Coex Mall in Gangnam which has the largest underground shopping mall in Asia and luxury Hyundai Dept Store."
Endless rounds,"You will be surrounded by cuisines, beauty shops, souvenirs, coffee houses.... Wow I will say! Another shopping paradise. Addicted to Sweet Potatoe Latte from Ediya Coffee. Really aromatic taste that makes you want more of it. Within my 4 days stay, I drank at least 2 cups a day to keep me warm during the winter cold. Along the sides, the unique yellow trees were planted which brightens up the attractions. I bet you can almost get what you want. Promotions going on in the beauty shops especially face masks, toners, moisturizers, cleanser.... etc. Saw a Whale skeleton(Seoul Signature Tower) along the way back to Hotel just opposite. "
"Fun crazy place, street eats & shopping",Cool place to stroll around and discover a ton of local street eats and some souvenir shopping. Great at night where everything's out!
Good Fun light shopping,"Shopping for knick knacks, and fun items worth the visit. Street Food was amazing. Hygiene Levels amazing, so good with that I was impressed."
Busy busy busy...,You will most certainly find what you are looking for around this shopping area or end up buying something you did not even need. Also lots of food stalls to satisfy both savory and sweet palates.
The best for cosmetic shopping,"If you are cosmetic lover, this is the best place for you. You can buy the cosmetic with acceptable price. not too expensive & not too cheap also."
Good shopping for skincare.,You can take your time shopping at this area. Similar shops all around with repeating brands.They do not really offer much free gift as previously but spent more than certain amount have 20% disc for some store as well as tax rebate. Some facial masks have good deals. Not much clothes but plenty of skincare. 
Shopping street for tourist,"This place is just a shopping street for tourists. Not only that you could have your meal after a long shopping. Food outlets and restaurants are just all over the corners. And not only that the restaurants here are serving good food. You could shop till drop. many outlets are serving mainly on lady products. You could find many famous brands items are easy to be found, such as Korean and International ones"
"Cosmetics, Cosmetics, Cosmetics!",I've never seen so many cosmetic shops in one area. There must be at least 100 if not more in Myeongdong. They sell cosmetics made in Korea. Have you noticed how beautiful the Korean skin is? I think their cosmetics must be fabulous to produce such beautiful skin.Most of the shops let you try them out before purchasing. I went to one of the less expensive shops called Orchid. The lady put whitening cream on one of my hands 5 days ago and that hand still looks whiter than the other. I wish I would have purchased the product. There are other stores in this area and a very big department store at the end of the street. I think it's a LOTTE store. Also the stores you see now in every major city.On the day I was there two guides were helping people and gave out maps of the stores. They also answer questions of where you can find things. Street food is available too. It's fun to people watch. There are a few benches near the cross intersection of the 2 main streets. No cars in this area makes it easy to walk around.
"a Tons of cosmetics shop, Street food","Day and night ""Ladies time""Many Cosmetics shop, Clothes, food, cafeYummy street foodI just wanna say WOW... "
Has every store you could ever need,"You can buy from all the beauty boutiques here, plus you can eat great street food and visit one of the many, many, many good cafes and restaurants in Seoul :) just gets crowded, naturally, because tourists flock here"
"Cosmetics, cosmetics, cosmetics","Amazing place to buy cosmetics. Easy to reach by metro or bus, variety of food, including restaurants for vegans, halal food, traditional food. Better to visit in the evening. Lots of discounts in October sales "
Lively with young people,"A buzzing area with many young people, similar to XiMenDing in Taipei. Many restaurants, food carts and shops selling clothes, toys and skin care products. "
Excellent street of shopping,Shopping freak people can visit Myeongdong market. This is central place of Seoul and you will get everything what you except few options of electronics whichbyou will get in Gagnam street.Must see location.
Shops galore,"Book a hotel in Myeongdong and you will not go wrong. All the major cosmetics shops are here - Nature Republic, Innisfree, Etude House, The Face Shop, etc. You will also find Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and Lotte Department Store (with a vast supermarket and food court). Restaurants also abound. "
Fun Market To Visit,Not the cheapest market in Seoul but some higher end stores here. Easy to get to and a fun place to visit for 1/2 a day.
Not as good as 10 years ago,"10 years ago when I went there, it's very crowded, and skin care products were not expensive at that time. 10 years later, most of the shops were still the same, but the price were double and even triple. I didn't buy anything this time, just walked 20 minutes, then left. "
"packed with tourists, busy, sales asst can be pushy","lots of skincare shops. i wouldn't say it's cheaper than other places but they have good offers if you buy in bulk (eg. buy 10 get 10) there's multiple shops of the same brand, so dont worry if you forget to buy something, just walk along further and you'll prob find the same shop again. also some shop offer immediate tax refund and there's a place to get your tax refund here, so that's very convenient because you dont have to sort it out when you're rushing at the airport. crowds can be crazy and some of the sale asst can be quite pushy. good place to visit if you want to bulk buy skincare items and dont mind fighting the crowds."
Fun Nighttime Street Fair-style Walkabout Experience,We went for the sights and the sounds and were not disappointed. Walking those streets at night is a real neon-light and pulsating music extraganza. We had lots of fun just walking around. If you want to shop go during the day. At night it is more of a street fair than a shopping district. We had a blast soaking in the atmosphere. The only money we spent was on a couple of food vendors. It was all about the sightseeing. We went back twice - go at night for the sights - during the day for actual shopping.
Must do shopping trip for beauty products ,"This is a great market to visit not only is there a vast amount of shops to buy beauty products but there is also a huge amount of street food stalls with a variety of food to try, including halal offerings. When you get tired from all the shopping there are also a number of massage places at very reasonable price points. The beauty freebies are great too! "
Shop til drop,"A must place for first timer in Korea. The facial products are getting cheaper if you purchase in large amount. However, not so cheaper compare to market in nandaemun."
Best at night!,Cosmetics and skin care are everywhere. But then there's all sort of food vendors. Make sure you have lots of Won. They do not take US$ or credit cards- Street vendors.
The place to buy your beauty products,"Get alot of free gifts from the shop when you purchase your beauty products. Spend 30,000 won and above in a shop and tourists are eligible for immediately tax refund. Remember to bring your passport with you. Go there in the evening around 5-6pm if you want to eat street food. But be prepared for the crowds at that timing too"
Not that cheap..must bargain more,It was very unique shopping street..but it mostly not cheap at all for sourv. Need to bargain more if you want to buy more that 5 and above. Can get cheaper if you can speak korean..they love it eventho your korean is so-so.. at least we tried to impress then for cheaper prices.. but they very friendly all the time.. maybe have some of them not.. it depends on the situation.. hehhe .. luckily i get too much cheaper price plus with extra free give.. 
"Nice varied shopping, stores and street vendors","Great shopping area, very vast. Good variety of upper end street vendors (socks, toys) and stores. Bought socks, uniqglo and stuffed animals. Also had chicken and beer. Would recommend for an evening/few hours."
Cosmetic area,"A lot lot lot of cosmetic and street foodI think i would get alot of free samples here by reading the previous experienced comment. But it turn out the seller here are mostly chinesse and very aggresive.If u came to the store just to look around and or just buy 1 item, they dont give you lots of samples or free item.It turns out in dongdaemun area where i stay where less people to concentrate to buy cosmetic there.. i get more samples and freebies there.Maybe they do that to attract more people? Anyway myeongdong is a must visit at least once for tourist"
Amazing shops with great promos and street food,"You can find many shops...fashion, cosmetics, restaurants, souvenirs, and the most varieties street food here. The service is good also with lots of samples given from the cosmetic shops."
Bustling streets for shopping and food,This is a must visit for people who want to shop especially for cosmetics and for those who just want to go on a food trip. The streets are lined with cosmetics shops and some other goods (like Uniqlo). The area though busy is relatively clean and safe. My only complaint is that the main street should have been closed to vehicles and converted into a more pedestrian friendly area.
Shopping,"From the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong, the shops are at the doorstep so to speak.Also ideal for zipping back to hotel to deposit 1st load of shopping & zipping out again for next load."
Myeongdong ,"We are staying in Days Hotel, right in the Myeongdong District. Super crowded on a weekend, lots of shopping till past 11pm and lots of street food too. But I must say the street food here is not exactly cheap though. "
Best cosmetic shopping street,If you love Korean cosmetics or skin care you must be here. Every shops have promotion and discount. I have got lots of facial mask and the price here is very cheap.
Attractive and bustling place,Great area to visit mainly at the evening. A lot of food's stands with a verity and Korean traditional food. Many shops and restaurants to visit. Do not miss if you are in Seoul.
Beauty and Fashion Shopping,Shopping district for beauty and modern fashion stuffs. Also good place for tasting street foods and local restaurants.
Fun Night Time Adventure of snacking while shopping,"Myeongdong night shopping street is worth a visit. The vendors sell all kinds of foods to try! Garlic shrimp sticks, octopus on sticks, strawberry covered mochi, mocha sticks, cheese on sticks and more! Need makeup? There are a zillion make up stores lining the streets. Eujiro 1 stop is close to where the action starts across the Lotte department store. There is even a Daiso here!"
Great shopping for cosmetics,I love shopping here for the variety in Korean cosmetic products the food here is quite nice as well even though not much of a variety. The street is always full f people and the atmosphere is fun
Shopped and ate,We wondered the area and also shopped I. The big Lotte department store nearby. Great food and lots of shops. It was fun.
good for beuty shops but they are all chains,"good for the chains ( H&M , zara uniqlo etc ) and beuty shops bit overcrowded and mass market good street food after 4pm"
Superb,"I loved the experience. There were a lot of options between fashion, food, cosmetics, hostels and a lot more. I'll never get tired of this place because of the wide variety of selections."
Souvenirs and street vendor food,"If you are looking for souvenirs at reasonable prices then this place is probably your best option. The products here are half the price of Insadong markets, although you won't find the more exotic up market items here. There are lots of street vendor stalls where you can try the local Korean foods too. The best time to visit is in the afternoon and early evening. Many stall holders start packing up in the early evening, although the food vendors continue later."
Great place for women to shop... and for men to eat!!!!,"It's a great place for women to shop for cosmetics and some clothes... that is why my wife and daughter kept on coming back. Good thing it was just in front of our hotel. The street food was a sight to see... grilled octopus, lobster tails, steak, Korean food, Turkish Ice Cream and a lot more."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Good shopping area, near myeongdong station. Street food nice. Beauty shopping a lot. Shop and Shop."
Excellent shopping destination,"Supre place for street food, small trinkets, a plethora of cosmetic shops and many many more. A place to leisurely walk through and enjoy shopping. "
worth the visit,street is nice tat is fill with food n snacks stall. it became crowded when it become nite!!! it wld b good tat u walk down the street n try out the different food for dinner...
"If you don't plan to shop, don't come.",You can get a lot of things here. Various kind of food. If you like cosmetic this street is a heaven for you. A lot of shops giving free samples to customer whether you buy from their shop or not. Try their street food.
Lots of nice street food and tons of cosmetic shops,the place is bustling with activities and there are lots of nice street food there. You can also buy lots of cosmetic there cos there are many cosmetic shops there. Its really eat and shop cosmetic till you drop!
Must go,"This shopping street provides everything you'll need from cosmetics to clothes, and not to mention; lots of food! (restaurants as well as street food) but the street food and clothes are pricier as compared to ewha/ express bus terminal shopping street"
Lots to choose from.,"There are all kinds of shops... from designer brands, to discount shops. The area is also thick with street food vendors with some tasty varieties of Korean food."
Cosmetics Paradise,One of the must visit places not only for the females but for everyone. This place is a well-known paradise for cosmetics products but it is also a great place to get delicious street food and some clothings. I've always tried to stay near myeongdong and it's a nightly affair to walk around for food and shopping. It's like you'll never get tired of this place even though you've been here more than 10 times. 
Great value of everything,"Loved this place for shopping, massage, food, puppy cafe and even way to Namsan Tower. You'll never find place like Myeongdong shopping street from anywhere on Earth. Everything is in this area you don't have to go so far to get different shopping list."
Experience the evening shopping crowd,"The first time I walked through Myeongdong's shopping area was Wednesday early afternoon, and it was relatively empty. I didn't understand what everyone was talking about.Then I braved the elements, and went out on a Saturday evening around 8pm. Not to shop, but to experience the crowd. It was crazy and exhilarating. I suggest you do the same, but don't shop! In that crowd it's impossible to think straight, and you'd end up spending more money than you should.I have huge respect towards all the people working in the area."
Bustling stalls ,Browsed the area and enjoyed looking at all the items on sale. We went in the evening where there were lots of food stalls set up too which added to the atmosphere. 
Overcrowded and over-hyped,"We had heard that this is one place you must visit in Seoul and do shopping. Well it is like another centreplace for shopping in any other city of the world. The streets are narrow, very crowded and one has to move in a sea of people."
Must see!,"Myeongdong is the centrum of shopping! It's a very nice experience to see it at night too, where many of the shops are still open. Furthermore there are streetfood all along the street."
Bustling Street with Full of Cosmetics!,Very Crowded. Many street food and many cosmetics. Many offers everywhere. You will get confused which street you have walk as many cosmetics shops are repeated shops. There's also some shopping centres around for you to shop some clothes & shoes.
Good steals but need not spend the whole day there,"If you're into korean fashion, food, and makeup, here is the one-stop station where you can get everything you want without burning a hole in your pocket. However, I would say half a day is sufficient as the shops / styles are repetitive."
"lots of shops, but.....","the shops repeat and repeat again, if you have only 1-2 days in seoul to do shopping, here is the good place to go."
"Great place to shop for cosmetics, street food, LINE products and other vendors ","The best part of our trip was staying in Myeongdong and being near to the numerous cosmetic brands. The street vendors also set up shop in the evening till about 11pm for food and accessories.There also many restaurants and food outlets to cater to various taste buds. Convenience stalls are also everywhere, including a few Marts that sell Korean food stuff. They even provide packing and sending to your hotel.An interesting outlet are the Line shop where one can take a photo with the huge Brown bear and shop for their merchandise and Brown ice cream. Other interesting places are the Cat and Dog cafes where you can play with the cute and beautiful animals while you have a drink. Their mascots are usually out and about to advertise their cafes.Do watch out for traffic as some parts of the streets are accessible to cars and motorbikes. The place is clean but Rubbish bins are not often seen. So do bring along a plastic bag if you are trying out the street food as you may end up with alot of stuff on your hands. Also, the streets may be a little confusing at first as they all seem to look the same.We hardly see anyone bring children while there, but South Koreans generally seem to like them. It may get a little boring for the kids if the wife is shopping alot. We entertained the kids by trying out the different food."
Crazy fun shopping!,Started down the main street late afternoon and finished up after dinner. Headed there to do some shopping and came away with bags full of beauty products. Face masks and shampoos are MUST buys here. Found a Korean grill restaurant to have dinner and wish I'd saved room for the fantastic street foods... grilled lobster for 5000 won - MUST try!
Full of visitors,"In the walking street, there are many stalls to sell different foods. Also some stalls to sell others such as clothing, socks, cosmetics etc. You can easily spent a day in this shopping area."
nice crowded area,"you can have a street food here & satisfy your culinary needs.also, you can buy accessories, make up equipment, cell phone accessories "
Good Shopping Area,"Lots of high end shopping, lots of bargain shopping. Good buys can be found for all types of shoppers."
Great shoppings,"At Myeongdong shopping street you can find the most trendy toys, fashion and entertainment. This place is good for every age, from eat to play, anything........ "
A lot to shop,"Very good shopping in this area especially Korean brands cosmetics, You can easily spend half a day or even a whole day there, there are also a lot of restaurants, so you can take breaks to rest whenever you want. The street food stores are interesting too, though I'm not a fan. "
GREAT,It has everything from cds to makeup. It's affordable and has very good quality. Late in the evening you can go and get some food from The dozens of food carts! There are a few dog and cat cafés where you can have a Coffee/Ta and cuddle up With a dog/cat
Crazy busy,"If you're a makeup/skincare fanatic, this street will drive you nuts. There's always SO many people, though, even during weekdays!"
You may get lost ,There are lots of shops in myeongdong. Visited there 2 years ago and many shops have changed. However they have lots of duplicate shops especially cosmetic shops .so if you feel the service is not that great for one of the shop just go to another one. 
Shop till you drop,"Nice small small store with many variety of korean and international brand. Best to buy cosmetics, clothes and look for sale items. Here you can find almost everything. Important to bring lots of money to spend =)"
Bustling street with tons of shopping and restaurants!,"I found this street on the upper end but not as up ended as Gangnam. At least it is affordable. It has tons of skincare shops, large Lotte and Shingasae Departmental stores anchor the streets among with many great restaurants, coffee houses and tea houses. It is full of street food vendors too. It is brightly lit, bustling with people till at at least 10:30pm. A couple of bars open till later. Highly recommend this area. If you can only visit 2 markets in Seoul and also buy things, this will be one of them. "
"Makeup, coffee, cake central!","An overwhelming experience. Great shopping area but the plethora of make up, coffee and cake shops is a first in my travels. Great vibe and experience and one can spend hours and hours wandering around people watching albeit most are there to shop, shop and shop. "
Shopping..Cosmetics..Street foods and atmosphere.,"Myeongdong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul and arguably its most impressive. It’s home to many mid- to high-end stores like Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Forever 21, Bulgari, and LV, not to mention row upon row of Korean cosmetic shops such as The Face Shop, Belif, Primera, Holika Holika, The Saem, ONL, Shara Shara, Etude House, Aritaum (which houses Laneige, Aritaum, Hanyul, IOPE, Modi), Laneige, Mamonde, and more. When you hear people talking about Korean cosmetics, they’re probably talking about this place. An attraction on its own, these cosmetics are what many tourists come here for.There are tons and tons of good glorious street foods and restaurant available here. You got to come to Myeongdong and check out the atmosphere yourself!"
"If you love cosmetics, you should be here!","Myeongdong Shopping Street is a paradise for those who love cosmetics, although place is not entirely dedicated for the likes of The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc. When we went there, there were only FEW SALES or DISCOUNTS so we weren't able to score cheap finds. Just hoarded few Nature Republic products. "
"great place to shop, but street food a bit expensive","A lot of shops selling trendy clothes and shoes, as well as masks. Many of them speak fluent mandarin and offer discount if you buy a lot. Street food is little bit expensive though."
Excellent ,Is a excellent lovely place to shop. Love it there. Would recommend this place to anyone holidaying near. 
Friends shopping spree,"Lots of shops for cosmetic products. Sports shoes are also priced reasonably. Do not miss out the street foods available in the area like teokboki, fish cake, egg bun, octopus, etc. "
A taste of Korea,"The small foodstands deserve the 5 stars, offering you a wide variaty of korean tastes at affordable prices. Prices at the stores were expensive though, so don't expect to find any bargains. "
Shopping heaven for K-cosmetics,"It is definitely a dream street for K-beauty lovers! You can shop from day to midnight, as most of the shops will only close at around 12am. Other than cosmetics, Myeongdong shopping street is also equipped with many delicious street food and restaurants! It is a must go place for girls~~ "
cosmetics lovers,you will find yourself in the middle of cosmetics shop. they give a great offer for every purchase. street food also available along the street but price is expensive.
Exciting,"So many shops, restaurants, crowded with lots of people, It's vibrant, exciting and interesting! Not necessary to shop but to enjoy the experience of this surroundings."
Shopping? Myeongdong has you covered!,Makeup Check! Skincare Check! Clothing Check! Shoes Check! Accessories Check! Food Check! Myeongdong is the shopper's dream destination. You can never miss a skincare/makeup shop there's one every few stores and when you're tired from shopping you can eat or take a break at a cafe. The only thing you may regret is using all your money too quickly
Shopping galore!,"Vibrant area that has lots of shopping boutiques. Most stores are Korean cosmetic shops but there are some shoes and apparel shops like H&M, Adidas, Zara as well. Street market starts at night. There are street food as well. Most shops stay open till 11pm. "
Shopping Heaven but Overcrowded and rude promoters/staff,"A lot of similar brands along the streets - as it's really crowded and make sure you have a check list with you on your purchase. Some shops might have a slightly better deal and for some products, you may get it at a better price at the underground walkaway of Myeongdong Station.It's great as there are many things to shop and eat however the promoters particularly at the beauty / wellness stores are much ruder (i guess they must have been too frustrated as they faced a lot of people daily).Do look out for those push carts along the streets as well - fashionable and affordable clothes P/S: most of them can converse good mandarin"
Street Food and Malls,"If u are a shopper, this is a must go place. The food sold are like those in Taiwan nite markets and along the streets are all the fashion retail, cosmetics, restaurants, etc... very crowded place and across the road via a underground shopping mall is high class malls, eg Lotte and Lotte Young, pretty expensive but very upmarket, fashionable and unique in designs. For the underground mall, u can give it a miss. So the food street retail shops are more reasonable in pricing. If u are a shopping fanatic, give yourself at least one full day. "
Great for cosmetics shopping!,This district is a real heaven for cosmetics lovers! So many skincare and make up to buy from! The shop attendants can be a little pushy sometimes and they follow you in every step. Shopping for clothes is much more expensive than Europe example: Zara clothes were much more expensive than my country. 
Very fun,"Tons of street food and tons of shopping. A must see on your trip to Seoul! Very popular for makeup and facial products, but also some souvenirs. "
Shopping myeongdong ,Bustling shopping district with thousands of cafe and skincare and fashionable clothing. Streets food is great. Must try the fish waffles with ice cream. Halal food available. 
Shopping+street food but too crowded! ,"Myeongdong is a good place to shop and at the same time eat street foods!!! If you dont like to eat while roaming around shopping, you can go ahead and find a restaurant that you want since myeondong is also full of restaurants. However this place really gets crowded in the afternoon till late, like too crowded wherein its so hard to walk or take pictures. Just be careful of your belongings while walking in the busy crowded streets of myeongdong. Getting there you can take the subway, line 4 exit 6. Or other exits if you prefer. I enjoyed eating their street foods! Really specially the tofu kind of cheese !! "
Shopping paradise,"You can shop, and shop. Lots of things to buy branded ones too, face mask, eyes mask spoiled for choices"
Pass by after pilgrimage ,"On our way to check in to airport in incheon we pass by the cathedral there Myeongdong and fid some shopping. It was fun. Many things you can find. From bags, accessories, beauty products, food etc etc. there's money changer. There's resto and banks. We love to shop there. And the Catholic Church was within the shopping street. Prices for items we bought were cheap. "
Best shopping Experience,"It i sone of the best shopping experience if you considering buying local brands alongwith popular international brands, it has everything."
Too crowded,"This street is good I guess if you want to buy cheap Korean beauty products. Many Chinese tourists with suitcases shopping here. I don't think that it is a tourist attraction, just for shopping if you are interested with those products. Would not recommend..."
"Lots of people, lots of shops, lots of restaurants","It took me forever to find this (don't know why) but go at night, an incredible array of people, shops, restaurants, and food carts (really, try the food carts!)"
Shopping and yummy food stalls,Very busy shopping street worth a stroll but didn't find it the most exciting range of stores. Mostly repeat of the same Korean cosmetic stores again and again. But lots of independent stalls out of the front of stores selling all sorts of things and lots of yummy food stalls! Very crowded on weekends. Close walking distance to to Namsangol Hanok Village and Numdaemun Markets which are both worth a visit.
Wow,"So much to see, so much to do, so much to buy haha. Ton of people, good mix of Korean and western shops."
Lively street,"Shopping heaven for skincare and makeupYou can go round and round the streets. Plenty of choices for food too! Myeongdong theatre house live performances, cinema Theater is also available. "
Shopping. Night life. ,"We went on a weeknight. It was really busy. Even if you don't want to shop you should go there for the atmosphere and to check it off on the bucket list. There were a lot of duplicate shops. There is also an underground shopping Centre at the Myeongdong subway. If you have time check it out, the stuff there are pretty cheap Women's clothing starting at 10,000 won. A lot of trinkets. To note the socks DO make great souvenirs. There's a stall above ground selling for 11 pairs for 10,000. Average price per sock is 1,000.they have different characters. Fun and cute. "
Great food and shopping (especially for the ladies!),"For a first visit to Seoul, Myeongdong should be one of those stops in the itinerary that you should not miss. Myeongdong is a place that is also relatively great for street photography too, especially at night when the crowds get rather packed. It is quite easy to get here by the Seoul Metro at Myeongdong Station, but it is also surprisingly easy to walk down here too from other places such as Insadong or the Main Lotto Department Store. Myeongdong is great for mainly two things: food and shopping.The food is something everyone can be satisfied with while there. There are the usual restaurants at the shopping malls and blocks lining Myeongdong, but the real deal here are the street stalls, which will start to appear and step up in the afternoon at around 3pm plus. But most of them will only be active at night, and that is also when Myeongdong looks and feels at its best. The food at the street stalls are quite good, especially its ice cream and traditional Korean snacks. However, compared to our experience at Taiwan's night markets, they still lag behind a little in quality in our opinion. Even if you do not know Korean, you can just point at the food you want and the vendor will understand easily. Price-wise, they are not really the cheapest and are quite comparable to similar places in Seoul.The other thing Myeongdong is great is the shopping, especially for the ladies! Sure, there are shops for everyone like Artbox and the Line Friends shops, but one thing that you will notice there is the relatively large proportion of cosmetics shops, such as Olive Young, Nature Republic and Innisfree, just to name a few. You can get quite good bargains on these cosmetics there and they even offer a few samples for you to try or take before you buy!There is also something for the animal lover, with cat cafés and dog cafés at Myeongdong. There's even a ring making café for those couples looking for a unique experience. However, the cafes are often not obvious at first glance as they are often situated at the smaller and less crowded alleys, so it may take a while to look for these places.Because of the heavy influx of tourists from China, that means that many of the street stall owners and shopkeepers are often able to speak some Mandarin these days too, along with a bit of English. In fact, quite a certain amount of the store signage were in Mandarin too. Myeongdong Cathedral is a short walk away at the end of the street, and is worth taking a look as well. If you wish to change your money to the South Korean Won in South Korea, this is the place to change as the rates are often more favourable here and the value of the South Korean won tends to drop outside of South Korea."
Korean cosmetics heaven!!,"If you're into you Korean cosmetics and face care..this IS the place.It's like a couple of blocks of all the Korean cosmetics brands available on earth lolEtude House, The Face Shop, Tony Moly, Missha etc are all here, many having multiple outlets in the area. Lots of freebies like face mask sheets & sample lotions etc when you buy something and if you buy alot, feel free to ask for extra freebies or bargain the price down ;) Research what brands and products you're going to buy before you come here to save yourself some time because it's quite addictive and you can easily spend half the evening in this area just wandering around selecting everything.Apart from all the street food, there isn't much to eat here. There's that famous noodles place but I found it very garlicky and overrated and also that famous bibimbap place on th quieter end which was also overrated. Definitely get your cosmetics fix here and eat elsewhere! Namdaemun is a short 10mins walk away ;)"
A very happening place. ,"My hotel was a stone's throw away from Myeongdong and I really enjoyed the energy and buzz along the streets. The streets are different in the day time and at night. Go around 3 in the pm to experience the transformation. In the day time, many people strolling through the streets. In the late afternoon, the peddlers would bring their carts and setup shop. In the evening, the streets are buzzling with people. Some locals are starting to avoid this area as the are too many foreigners. If you are a fan of LINE, be sure to visit the shop and q for a photo with a gigantic bear!"
Great,"This location suitable for discounted cosmetics, tshirt, jacket and hoodie. Snacks and street food nt cheaper thn other shopping places"
"whatever you need, it is here!",best place to shop. our hotel is right in myeongdong and it has everything that we need!strongly recommended to visit.
Cool,Very cool place to walk around. Seems authentic seoul. Very safe. Great streetfood. Nice to go hunting for souvenirs.
Happening Place in Seoul,"This is a place where you can really feel the atmosphere where there are so many street food, shopping and cosmetic shops.The street food is really good. However, how many of them are authentic Korean food? But it is still delicious.Very competitive and aggressive selling especially the cosmetic shops."
Eat and shop!,"Luckily we were staying in the Myeongdong area and this was just outside of our hotel. There's a lot of food vendors, beauty and souvenir shops. One day is not enough! The food vendors start setting up at about 4PM, but the shops open in the morning. It's pretty much the same beauty shops, so if you missed one shop and wanted to check it out again, you'll definitely see the same shop around the corner. You'll be surprised how much time you can spend in one skinny, long, and what seems like a never-ending alley. Definitely check it out!"
Shopping ,"Great place for shopping in Korea especially with friends. There are a lot cheap street food so no need to worry about being hungry. The people at stores are nice but if you are a tourist, they may lie about the price or exaggerating their information. So be careful! Overall things tend to be cheap for buying except luxury stores."
Not what I expected,"I found myself very confused by this area. There must have been at least 4 of each store. I guess just to fill up the area and make it seem bigger than it actually is? It was neat, but there wasn't anything particularly special about it. If you're looking for shoes or natural beauty products, this would be the place to come. "
Experience Modern Seoul,Nice commercial area to experience Seoul's pop culture. Good for buying clothes and make up. One of the must-go spots in the city of you are interested in shopping.
We love this shopping district .,"Shop all you want from brand name to street cloths , food and all kind of food . So good to look at and eat . You will enjoy this place .be careful not to get lost .too many ppls . "
"Bundles of joy, goods, and food","Visited here on my first day in Seoul, right after checking in to the hotel, with main objective - dinner. Gotta admit that this place is a cool place where you can find lots of street food and goods, as well as lots of cosmetic products. If you are aiming for the cosmetics nd street food (they have halal food here), this place have them."
Good for shopping and eating out ,Great if you love shopping and don't mind the crowds . It's full of life and has many shops and reasonably priced clothes . Great Korean and Japanese food everywhere . There's a great Catholic Church nearby called myeongdong sondang . 
Great shopping area,"Whatever you need you will find it here. And if get tired and need a break from shopping there are tons of restaurants within 5 steps of each other. And entertaining is not to far either. There is so much action and vibrant energy, you won't regret visiting here. If you are lucky you may run into a Korean celebrity. "
Great shopping for wives ,"I read in a review a guy said three hours of shopping and all he walked away with was empty pockets and a happy wife! Well it's true lots of women's clothing and makeup, nothing my size or colour. But my wife had the time of her life. So totally worth it. Happy Wife Happy Life! We went late and stayed until around 1:00am and the area was packed. "
Way too crowded ,"Went with my wife, and my two young children. The stores and atmosphere were really nice and clean. Kinda like the Korean version of the Grove in LA if anyone has been. There are some American stores that have made it to Korea but because of the cost of import a pair of American made shoes costs about 3x's more. The biggest downfall was the crowd. It was a bit much. If you have any type of anxiety or have panic attacks with large groups... This is not the place to be. "
Huge outdoor shopping area,"Lots of local fare, mixed with some nicer western stores - prices are regular, it's not a haggling place."
Shopping Heaven (Especially for the women),"Myeongdong Shopping Street is an amazing spot and must-visit for travellers when in Seoul. The streets, albeit croweded and busy, are easy to walk. The cosmetics shops around are great, and they are constantly having sales. The food street also has a variety of food, ranging from Nutella crepe, lobster, scallops, egg bread etc. You can literally spend the entire afternoon/evening here. Also very accessible by the metro (alight at Myeongdong station)"
"Night Market, Cosmetic Shopping Paradise",You can find and eat all kind of delicious food in night market of myeong dong around 6pm-10pm. You can buy mask of different brands in bundle with reasonable price. 
Food Haven at night!!!,I stayed in Myeongdong street for 5 nights with J-Hill hotel. I am happy everyday to shopping and eat delicious food. Their street food is outstanding. Look much cleaner compare to Thailand street food. This area is full of tourist and you can bargain with street vendors for clothes and souvenir. The Lotte Department Store is 5 minutes away.  
Myeongdong Shopping Street // Seoul,"Myeongdong shopping street is well known for shopping destinations, Located in the heart of Seoul and It's quite easy to came here. There are a lot of shopping stores (cosmetics, clothing, shoes), street stalls and yummy street foods. I was very impressed because I can find everything that I need from here with reasonable prices. Street food, it's great !!! Whenever I came to Korea, I will be here always. Highly recommend for everyone especially the people who love shopping."
My Seoul trip,"Meyongdong is the main shopping district in Seoul.As soon as you get out of the subway station you are right in the middle of it.It is one main street connected by a number of side streets. The main street is full of cosmetic shops and street vendors. Most of the street vendors come out in the afternoon and stays on until late in the night. Weekends are very crowded. Do not forget to look up when you are walking down the street, there are a number of good restaurants on this street.With in the block in Lotte's main store and Shinssgae department store is only a block away.My suggestion is to visit in the afternoon or at night 7-10 p.m. to get a good idea of what is going on.At the entrance to the main street and near the subway exit is an optical shop with some good frames at very reasonable price.They claim that they can do your prescription lenses(normal prescriptions only) in 1/2 and hour."
Love this market,This is a definite must do! There is a subway very close by as well as city buses that run. We love the street food and enjoyed the people watching and shopping. It can be very crowded and cars drive on some of the streets where people walk so be careful. 
Spend a day here,I think we need to spend a day here. So large and big place to shop. Heaven of street food and korean cosmetics!
Family trip,A good place for shopping and street food. Numerous choices of korean street food that one cannot resist and very reasonable prices. Skin care products shop everywhere and with Mandarin speaking sales person. We shopped there virtually every day during our stay in Seoul.
Shop shop shop all day long (and eat too!),"Travelling isn't complete without a day spent at shopping (as per my girlfriend).Myeongdong should be experienced at least once during a visit to Seoul. I didn't really buy much besides streetfood and some places to eat Bing-soo, but it's really interesting to experience the massive crowds, pushy sales tactics and overall feel of what the young people in Seoul are up to these days.It's easily accessible by metro."
Lively Night at Myeongdong,"This is my second visit to Seoul. This time I purposely book accommodation in Myeongdong because for me, this is the best place to stay for tourist. In this shopping street, there is a lot of brand store which you usually found in shopping mall around the world. Cosmetics shop here is like a shopping paradise for woman. There is a lot of cosmetic shop and their offerings is different. Choose as you like.There is also a lot of hawker in the area and you can enjoy variety of Korean street food. For muslim, you can refer to a lot of articles online on which foor you can eat.As for restaurant, there is also a lot of restaurants you can try. In my opinion, Myeongdong shopping street is the best place to go shopping and hang out after a long day visiting the city. "
Great shopping area,"A great blend between old and modern time. Clean, but not sterile. Very alive. Tons of small shops, restaurants, cafes. Also has a night market with street food. Great location if you select your hotel. "
WOW! What an experience!,"We stumbled onto this area by accident! My son and I aren't big consumers, but we are big on experiences! So we just walked. At night. The bright lights and tons of little shops was almost over stimulating! We did keep trying the street food. Good Grief, it was AMAZING! I loved looking in all of the windows of the stores. I loved turning down the corners only to discover more stores and more street vendors. I didn't mind the overcrowded chaos! I don't have to live in the middle of this. Why they allow cars to drive down some of those crowded streets is beyond me. Personally, I'd be worried to take small children. If not tied to you, they could easily get lost. But teenagers would love it! It was a tremendous amount of eye-candy everywhere! You can literally shop 'til you drop!"
"Great place to exchange money and stock up on beauty products, watch your bags ","Great place to exchange money (I got 26 more won per dollar than at the best rate offered at Incheon airport)! Keep walking until you see the row of banks, and then you'll see the exchange shops all dotted around them. They are quite competitively priced, but make sure you ask 4-5 shops before exchanging. You can also negotiate a little bit on top (a few won per dollar...enough for a snack, depending on how much you're exchanging!) The exchange places are quite safe, and they mostly all speak basic English/Chinese/Japanese. I was very happy with my transaction there.Afterwards, there are a few shopping malls like Migliore, and lots of cosmetic shops to browse. Some cosmetic shops (especially without a famous brand) will entice you with free sheet mask/ other small thing to enter and browse. You need to browse for at least a couple of minutes but don't feel obliged to buy anything to keep your gift. A lot of cosmetic stores are repeats (eg there are like 3 Missha stores, 3 Tony Moly and at least 2 nature republic). Because you get good gifts if you spend over a certain amount (there are tiers/ thresholds advertised on a sign in the store), make sure if you want to buy stuff from 1 store, just browse, browse, browse and then buy it all in 1 go to get the best gift. Combine purchases with friends as well to get over the threshold. Otherwise, the gifts you get with small purchases (under 30,000) aren't that good (sheet masks, small samples of moisturiser or toner, cotton makeup remover pads). You could have got all that just by browsing a few shops.There are a lot of food places, lots of snacks, and generally a lot going on. Make sure you keep your valuables in sight at all times. Enjoy!"
Shopping n Food street,We stayed in a hotel near Myeondong. My friends and I had a lot of fun visiting all the stores especially the beauty supply store and trying out the different foods in the food street. The place is very vibrant place.
Trendy shopping in Seoul,"This seems to the shopping area for the younger crowd with plenty of clothing, shoe, and cosmetic shops. The girls in our group were in some sort of makeup nirvana as we were informed that Korean cosmetics are state of the art and so inexpensive that they were practically free. Many reasonably priced restaurants throughout plus some street food at night. Add a few crazy religious types howling at the soon to be damned shoppers and you have a great afternoon or evening before you. "
The place to be if you want to go shopping in Seoul,"We stayed at a hotel in the heart of Myeongdong and was not disappointed! Just a few steps outside of the hotel was food street lined with food carts in the late afternoons to late evenings. The area is teeming with restaurants and shops that sell everything from clothes (Zara, Uniqlo to name a few), to electronics (Apple) to a bewildering array of beauty products (Leaders, innisfree, to name a few). Believe me, it's the place to be if you want to be in the heart of the action in Seoul."
Count your mask sheets!!!,"When I was there, Skinfood and The Face Shop had deals buy 10 masks get 10 masks free for ₩10,000. The masks are stored in plastic packets so I assumed the count was accurate. When i came back and count each packets only had 9 mask sheets instead of 10 like they advertised. Not a lot but do make me wonder why big brands like them behave like that. Consider that most shoppers in Myeongdong are tourist, it affects not only the companies' image but Koreans' image as a whole"
Crowded and Wet Shopping,Was raining when we reached the Myeongdong shopping street. Jammed packed with loads of tourists and many buying cosmetics products. My wife went there for the purpose of buying cosmetics which is quite cheap comparing getting in Singapore but what was lacking is the services. Some of them are not even attentive in serving you and their eyes will be roving around which kind of pissed my wife off.
First time in Korea,I find the area to be popular with tourists looking for bargains. Street vendors were very friendly and the place appears to be very tidy and well organised. Plenty of items to look for and buy for self as well family members.
Shopping heaven ,Myeongdong is shopping heaven in korea. It's too big and I didn't have enough time to explore the whole area. Definitely will come back! Makeup lovers must go here!! Great street food too :) 
Shopping,"Myeongdong is smacked in between Dongdaemun and Namdaemun. It offers endless shopping to tourists both above and under ground. There are many eateries within. In addition, the local food fares are great. Visitors must not missed."
"too crowded, somewhat narrow streets",Good thing is that shops are open until quite late. It is bit annoying when these narrow streets get too crowded. 
Shopping Galore!,"The most crowded and lively place in Seoul.We spend a week in Seoul and came to Myeongdong twice because going once is simply not enough.Meyongdong is the place to be when you want to buy cosmetics and beauty products.All your favourite Korean products are there from Tony Molly, InnisFree,Nature Republic etc. I could go on and on but the point visit Myeongdong if you want a piece of adventure!"
Busy shopping district,Famous for tourist. Lots of eateries and beauty shops with great discounts. It is always crowded especially at nights. Street foods were the best. Most shops were repetitive. Almost all shop keepers were bilingual. A good place to buy souvenirs such as socks and facial masks. 
Shoppers dream but not for the faint!,"Myeongdong is a must visit for tourists even if you aren't a shopper at heart, you can still enjoy the street food and just experience the madness!Make sure to visit Sulbing (upstairs above one of the 10 Nature Republic stores) and enjoy the Hello Kitty Cafe. Make sure to stock up on all your skin care needs; but if you do nothing else; hit up the street 7pm or after and visit the food stalls."
excellent shopping paradise,"For girls, this is really a paradise. You can find nearly ALL Korean Cosmetics brands in Myeongdong Shopping Street. Also, there're ltos of shopping malls which covers quite a lot of local clothing brands. "
Many shops selling cosmectic,Good place to shop and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Myeongdong shopping street. There are many street food but some are over price as it is a tourist attractions area
Shopping paradise for girl,"I think it goes without saying Myeongdong is the paradise for girls. You can find all cosmetics brands there and many boutiques. However, I was quite shocked to see the food stalls at night and they were all the way up to the end of the main shopping street. And I was quite surprised to see most of them were run by Chinese! Anyhow, still a must go for tourists."
Cosmetics haven,"This is Seoul's version of night markets like the Temple street in Hong Kong. The difference is, you'll find a lot of cosmetics store here. Nature Republic after Etude House after The Face Shop. You'll find several shops for each brand. Buying in bulk will be cheaper. Other than beauty products you'll find variety of merchandise in the market. Great place for shopping."
The most crowded shopping street in Seoul,This market has many types of shops from luxury to popular. Cosmetics shops is alot. Street food is so delicious.
Great food and fun shopping!,"Myeongdong is a night market and some stores are open till 4:30 AM. I suggest that you come here with an empty stomach because even if you only intended to shop, you won't help but eat something from the food street. The prices are quite expensive (eg 3000 KRW for a palm-size fish shape cake with nutella inside) but they're good and the stalls are very hygienic. Plus it's the best place to really experience Seoul street food. The stores are not really group accordingly but most of the cosmetics shops like Etude House (there's two stores there), Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc. are close together so it's easy to compare products and stuff. There are a lot of stalls along the streets selling clothes but there are also clothes stores like Forever 21 (2 floors of it) and some other Korean brands that can be found there. In the same building as Forever 21, there are two floors of restaurants also so if you don't feel like eating street food you can go there. There's California Pizza Kitchen and other Asian/Korean restaurants there. There are also surprisingly dog and cat cafes there which was fun and other cafes (which you can find basically anywhere in Seoul) like Paris Baguette. It's also around 15 min walk away from a street that sells teacup pets, mostly dogs. You'll see lines of shops there along that street.The best way to get to main street is through the subway, cuz it's just right there when you go out."
shopping !,shopping and more shopping ! Dont be fooled by chic appearing shops because they may have sale items... you might be surprised by the price cut-off's... so just enter and browse! Best place to sample street foods an make-up galore in one place.
Worth a visit,Great food and shops but a little chaotic and really crowded. Overall we are glad we checked it out but definitely need high energy to make it out alive!
Myeongdong,This street is to visited after 6 pm when all the hawkers are opning their carts. All kind of foods can be tasted. It is open up to 10 pm. The ambiance is nice. 
Makeup Haven,"A must visit for all females, whether you're a makeup enthusiast or not. Some great novelty finds as well as products exclusive to South Korea. "
Visited many times.,"Lots of activities for tourists, especially shopping. many really good restaurants, especially Good Korean and Chinese restaurants. Movie theater shows foreign films."
Crowded with Everything,"This is where you could get everything, restaurants, cafe, fashion boutiques, cosmetics chain stores, massage shops, etc, big or small and modern or old-fashioned. "
Good for shopping ,Overall this is a good place for shopping with lots of eateries around. I will not recommend to eat the street food here although the taste of the food is quite good but most of it are just overpriced. If you really looking for a meal I will suggest u to go for a restaurant instead. 
Shoppers Paradise in Seoul,"this is a shopping paradise in central seoul. there are hundreds of shops selling mostly cosmetics, apparel shoes etc. its a shoppers paradise and offers good deals"
Must visit for shopping lovers,"Very interesting, busy shopping area always flooded with tourists. There is a mcm flagship store. This is the place you should buy cosmetic, most shop closed at 10pm but myeongdong still very happening till late night. The price are slightly higher then express bus terminal underground mall (ebts) but You would be surprise that those made in korea sock selling there is cheaper then ebts. I also love myeongdong underground where I can find cds & mini album & street food push carts!"
Foods and foods and cosmetic,"We were drown in foods and after two or three stalls, we already full. You can eat almost a wide selection of seoul street food in here. The price is average high ($3-5 per item). After having your stomach full, you can jump in cosmetic shops, clothes, shoes..."
Love it,"You couldn't walk away from this street, it's full of things and as a shopaholic, I spent 1 day just in this area"
Do0g and Cat Cafes,The whole shopping district seems dedicated to looking good. Coffee shops and make-up stores abound. But the most interesting to me were the dog and cat cafes where for the price of a cup of coffee you could visit with dogs or cats. What fun!
Cosmetics and Food,"This place is an experience with lots of street food and cosmetics. If you're in Seoul, visit this place for the ambience, people and what it has to offer. Worth a visit"
Fun shopping,"This is a one stop shopping for cosmetic goods. All korean brand are here, full and loud. The food also great, the street food is a so so"
Everything that you need,"Great market. This place has everything, clothes, shoes, jewelry, Korean crafts, food. Very busy. Some English spoken"
Awesome and so Korean,"We were lost in Myeongdong with thousand of shops, restaurant and lot's of funny things. Even we were on the street, or in the mall underground of big building, we were always in the crowd, funny and lovely atmosphere. "
Great shopping for beauty product,"As u would have known, this is the only place that u can buy most of the beauty products at good deals. They give a lot of freebies. The street food here is expensive. Especially if you buy grilled lobster, octopus etc. U can find famous food like Myeongdong kyoja, abalone or ginseng chicken porridge and ox soup. "
Expensive...,"Yes, you can buy anything and everything in Seoul. As long as you have a lot of money. When it comes to retail prices I thing it is even higher than Tokyo. "
One of the iconic place in Korea ,"A must place to visit in Korea.The place where you can spend one whole day. From clothing, shoes to cosmetics for example. There are many street food along roadside/ in front of the shops.. Downside was that some staffs are not that friendly, some not very willing to answer or showing attitude when you ask them questions regarding the products. Overall, the experience is still a pleasant one. "
Great Street,The area is always busy when the cosmetics shops are open inviting the passer by to come by giving free sumpling of their product even though u don't buy anything. There are 3 cat cafes where u can play with the cats. Night' coming even busier with street food.
Bustling with much life throughout the day,"We had been to Korea couple of times on our own and Myeongdong streets became a routine. A must go several times a week. We just love to walk and discover the shops that we missed out on. And great variety of street food stalls, cafes and restaurants and we never run out of choices. It's also safe for tourists, with pretty clean streets. "
The real Korea,This street full of energy and street vendors makes you understand Seoul. Full of exotic things to eat and buy makes this street a fun place to visit.
Makeup Heaven ,"If you love Korean Makeup and would love to shop, Myeondong is the place. Everything here is Makeup - innisfree, étude house, tony moly, olive young, skinfood, missha, etc. Anything Korean Makeup related is here. Plus there are a lot of Street food and cafes around the area. "
Heaven for korean skin care shoppers,"Korean skin care gains attention for more and more. If you happen to be a hardcore fans of Korean skin care, this area is definitely heaven for you. Way too many shops for any possible brands you want ( except Cosrx and Mizon, I did not find them back then). Not only skin care, but also street food and and cafe/restaurant. Even the underground area of the Metro station is shopping area. Just take a note, this area becomes really crowded in the evening."
Shopping at Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Myeongdong is such a shopping paradise that you won't satisfied in a day. We were there for a couple of hours but it felt like just a few minutes! There are so many shops that sells so many things especially skin care & cosmetic products which looks so appealing and price is reasonable and affordable. You can choose until you give up! The fun of shopping there is beyond words and I will definitely recommend to anyone who visit Seoul, this is a must place to go when you are there... "
Crazy fun place with lots of food and lots of cosmetics and socks,"Super fun place esp during the evenings. Lots of people, lots of places to shop, lots of socks and lots of Korean cosmetic stores. If you only had a little time and wanted to do shopping I would go there."
In trend with korean cosmetology and fashion,"I went there on friday afternoon ; it's very busy with tourists and local shoppers. The products here were good price with special discount ontop when you use either cash or credit cards. It's very quick and easy for shopping. There were so many teenagers too but prices may be higher than in Hongik area. More crowds of cosmetomaniacs aggregated here for masks, hand cream, body lotions and etc. "
Tooooooooo many people,It's very different from what I imagined...It's pretty much a giant shopping area which full of cheap cosmetics and skin care...Better shopping experience in Gangnam. 
Top #1 Place To Go Before Leaving Seoul,"This is the #1 place to go on my list. Myeong-Dong is bustling busy as the sun starts to go down. You should spend about 6 hours there and make sure you have some very comfy shoes. There are many shops open during the day and as it get close to night many of the street vendors will start to set up shop. If you are looking for skincare, this is the place. There are so many skincare shops for one to chose from and you can shop and shop until you know what you want. That is why I suggest to spend about 6 hours, unless you are staying in one of the hotel near Myeong-Dong which you can swing by before going back to your hotel. Most of the shop closes at 9pm and the street vendor will pack up by 10pm. Beside skincare there are also jewelry, branded shoes, and clothing to shop for. Then there is the street foods which are so delicious, cheap and filling. We had a great time here and since our hotel was nearby, we walked around Myeong-Dong almost every night until all the shops close to when the street vendors close up. We try different food every night from toppoki, fishcake, jjajangmen to abalone. Overall, this is a must go to place for everyone from young to adult and I guarantee everyone of all ages will have a great time. NOTE: Just make sure to wear comfy because you will be doing lots of walking. ENJOY!!!!"
Busy shopping street ,Went to myeongdong to do some shopping. Was surprised to find mostly modern shops. There were name brands along with Korean brands. There are also lots of places to eat along the small alley ways. 
Many skincare shops!!,"Many local Korean skincare shops! Fascinating experience walking through many streets with similar stuff!Seems like negotiation is possible, especially if you can speak mandarin, most of the shops have staff from northern china.. a nice place to spend some time, especially at night when there are many small snacks shops "
8 days tour of south korea,The prices of things here is at a bargain too short time for shopping here need more time please.!! Our group of tours friends say more time but was disappointed.The next trip to korea will diff will spend more time here.
Must visit. ,"Amazing and we had so much fun. You have to spend 6 hours at least there walking ,shopping and eating. I recommend it for all ages. And it's a must see when you visit South Korea. سوق خارجي رائع و طويل. تحتاج على الأقل ٦ ساعات للمشي فيه والتبضع والأكل. حتما أوصي به لكل الأعمار. ويجب زيارته لكل من يزور كوريا الجنوبية. "
Tons of cosmetic shops and food stalls,"If you're looking to buy Korean skin, face and cosmetics products, this is pretty much the place to go to. You can shop till your wallet is empty. Visit at night to get the full experience with the food stalls on the side of the street. Totally yummy goodness. "
LOVED THE PLACE!,"Myeongdong is a shopping mecca for cosmetics, beauty and skin care products. Just cant choose from the varied beauty care brands that abound the streets! Aside from the Cosmetics shops, branded and signature shops line the streets Lots of tourists though and at night, its too crowded to shop around. I suggest to come early to avoid the rush. There are tourism people to ask around for directions if you get lost."
Shoppping Overload,"This was an absolute of shopping! Having gone shopping at the Namdaemun Market over several days, this was a refreshing change. There are food carts galore and street vendors. But, there is an array (some repetitive) of shops and restaurants. There are several of the same face product stores on the same block so we got lost using stores as the landmarks. This market housed higher end stores and some of the trendier Korean shops.We tried to eat street food as much as possible (because there is so much of it) but the one thing we had several of on different shopping trips are the 32cm ice cream cones. They came on a cone or in a cup topped on some dry cereal. We tried all the flavors from different vendors. Yum!!In the clothing stores they don't allow trying on of the clothes. Me being a larger sized woman I was hesitant to buy tops without trying them on first.It was such a hustle and bustle kind of crowd so be ready yo go with the flow of shoppers!"
Good for only Chineses,"If you were from China or could speak in Chinese, Go there.Many shops for Chinese speaking people, not for Korean or English.If you were not from China or couldn't speak in Chinese, don't go.Too many people..... narrow street... tooooooooooooooooo many loud and unpolite and rude chinese...........(few of few of few chinese is good....)"
Nice for touristic citi walk,"Not that good for native citizens. I'ts Korea but almost seems like somewhere in China 'cause of signage and tourists.But if you like street foods, you could find various things in here. It's could be called as street food EXPO."
A bustling and colourful street,"A lot of fun, day or night. The street food was delicious and it was busy enough to feel a buzz without being overcrowded. Staying in a hotel along this street gives easy access to food and shopping. However, as it is closed to traffic, choose one on the periphery that's near the subway or a main road."
great shopping,"This shopping street is amazing, especially for beauty products, skin care, masks!!! and more activities in the evening, a lot of street food booths, and it is a fun place to walk around and have food & drinks."
Amazing!,"This was one of my favorite spots during my stay in Seoul. The street food is amazing and so is the shopping! I was only there during the evening/night, but I would definitely recommend it!"
A great place for ladies shopping for makeups,Myeongdong Shopping Street is a very busy street. Its is full of outlets selling makeups! Must be a kind of heaven to ladies. This is also place for you to try street food which are aplenty!The biggest Uniqlo outlet in South Korea is located right here in Myeongdong - just next to the Myeongdong Metro Station exit. 
Seoul trip,The place is always packed with tourist and if you are a cosmetic fanatic this will the place you to shop and compare. The packaging is good and generous with sample gift. Too crowded at times. Street food expensive . 
Too crowded and shops all the same,"I was disappointed with the shopping on offer as the choice was very limited-there are hundreds of shops but most are branches of the same brands, so you'll see 5 Olive Young's, 5 Etude Houses,etc. Some flagship stores but quality was poor.On the plus side, shop assistants were not pushy and lots of street food on offer as well as restaurants and cafes.I'd avoid going on a weekend or a holiday as it was ridiculously crowded which made the experience stressful.Perhaps during the week and earlier in the day it is a much nicer place to explore..."
lots of shopping,"one of the busiest district where you can shop from morning til night. From street food, local markets, cheap outfits to expensive items, skincare, cosmetics, cats and dogs cafe, massage, restaurants of 70 years history to modern fine dining Korean BBQ, you basically can find everything in this district"
Shopping Overload,"There are so many stores here, from little mom and pop stores to mega malls. Brands find all over the world to souvenir shops for local flare. You can get almost anything you want here. But because of the amount of stores, you will need to bring your walking shoes. Stores carrying similar items are sort of grouped together, but you'll have to walk around looking for things if you are trying to buy different items. Also lots of places to eat. So you will not go hungry. This is a popular place to shop, even in the subway itself there are shops, so be prepared to go against the crowd. "
Lost in Myeongdong,"Great place for shopping, especially make-up stuff with all popular branches(innis free, natural republic, the face shop, skin food, lush...), always discount & get countless samples. Lotte Young locates here also. Late afternoon you could enjoy lots of delicious street food."
Exciting shopping experience at Myeongdong,"I love walking along Myeongdong. The street offer so many stores, restaurant. It's perfect for someone who like shopping. Experience the local food is awesome here. "
Where do I even LOOK?!,"SO overwhelming to the senses but worth the trip. Lots of free samples from the beauty stores, lots of option for things to buy. If you are going for beauty products, make a list of what you want from each store before you go. Try the street food, explore the shops and be kind to the pressuring sales people. Stop at the cathedral on your way out to take a breather from all the hustle of the streets and shops!"
Shoppers Heaven,"Like Oxford Street, London on steroids this is one of the loud brash shopping areas of Seoul (but without the massive department stores). Lots of hotels, restaurants, cafes, street food and people! It was Korea Shopping Fair when I was there and the place was full of Chinese visitors buying up everything in sight - and there is a lot of stuff to buy!"
worth to go,"myeongdong is the place for female who love make up, and other cosmetics things. it is perfect to shopping cosmetics, clothing, and street foods."
Fun Shopping!,"If you enjoy walking around shopping both in boutiques or street stalls, this is the place to go. The myriad of food stalls selling all sorts of yummy treats make it all the more fun!"
Lots and lots of shops!,"There were so many skin care shops, and they all give samples and gifts when you make a purchase. If you're a shopper, you'll love this area. I bought a lot of face masks - great gifts - and socks. After five, the street vendors come out and offer a variety of food. I would say that Myeongdong is one of those ""must see"" places when you visit Korea."
amazing shopping and food,"amazing food street area. lot's of restaurants. we went there during Winter time, it was freezing cold by -21Degree celsius. We loved it. Get dressed properly and enjoy the great food."
Awesome street food,"The street food may only be available on the weekends, but definitely make an effort to come here hungry. Cheese scallops, conch on a stick, kimbap and more definitely make for a delicious experience. The interesting restaurants, cat cafes and stores are also quite fun."
Shops and more shops,"the amazing thing about the shops are that the staff all speak mandarin! a few may speak English. The fashion stores are interesting and of course we have the cosmetic shops everywhere. Some can do refund of tax on the spot which is really handy, other require you to get it at the airport. but not to worry the tax refund machines are found everywhere in the airport. There is usually a person to help with the machines, they are easy to use anyhow. the night market is pretty fun but I reckon some of the trinkets are overpriced, they are cheaper is the subway shops."
Noicy streets,All the regular international shops can be found here. So pretty booring shopping. Very noicy as all shops also play their music into the streets. Lots of food cooked and served on the streets. 
A must for shopaholics,This is one of the better places to go for a bit of shopping and enjoying street food! Lots of side streets to explore. If you enjoy a bit of shopping then this is a must. 
Our Favorite ,"We visited most of the markets in Seoul and liked this one the best. It is a nice mix of street food, vendors, and shops. It seems to have both locals and tourists. We a little shopping and a lot of eating."
Walk & shop,"A busy shopping street, most shops stay up late, bargaining is accepted and you might get good discounts if ur are good at it, you can also fins quite a number of eateries, access is easy by subway... "
Gurls Loooooveeeee this,I was so amazed on how Koreans so love cosmetics. Even if I don't tend to buy .. I was encouraged to buy especially when you tend to compare to the price in our country! Will be definitely be going back to this ♡♡♡
Shopping paradise,"The famous shopping street that none can miss! After 3pm or 4pm, there will be push carts appearing along the street selling from food to fashion wears etc. "
Great street food,Whilst the shops become a little repetitive theere is an endless variety of high quality tasty treats availble with helpful vendors able to explain most of the ingredients and will give a sample if asked. Artbox is a highlight for the kids. Head down to the subway durng the day to get away from the cold and enjoy many arcades of shopping with occasional food outlets.
This is shopping time,"Myeongdong is a large place for shopping and also for foods and snacks. Do spend some time here, especially when you are a shopaholic. It nice when you go there around 4pm onward since the street food starting to put in place selling various kind of snacks and foods.Lots of fashion/cosmetics even lotte department store building at the west part. If you happens to be there, don't forget to pale a visit at myeongdong tourist information to have a chance to wear hanbook (traditional korea outfit) for free."
Streetfood craze,"Fun for tourists and locals alike. Interesting street food options. Try some but go to restaurants in the area as Myeongdong offers good Korean-Chinese food as the area used to house the Taiwanese embassy and had many Taiwanese Koreans living in the area. Great local Chinese food restaurants, dim-sums with Korean twist. This is one of the must see unique places in Seoul."
its just like any other shopping or walking street in South East Asia,Full of tourists. Most of the shops have sales assistant that speak Mandarin due to the large mandarin speaking tourists who buy almost anything and everything. Nothing unique.
Tourist street,Crowded with tourists who enjoys street food and cosmetic shopping which is a bit expensive compared from other location (Honggik University shopping street). It is already close to Seoul station and Nandaemun cheap market (with cheaper street foods too)
Myeongdong,Loved the place!! It is big area and close to the Namdaemun Market. Really nice food and lots of shopping malls. The shopping is great! 
Everything you want,"Awesome place for food, shopping and especially for cosmetics of various korean brands. Come rain or shine still swarmed with locals and tourists."
Beauty Food Clothe etc,The place is teeming with mall stores shops restaurants street foods etc. a good place for shopping eating sightseeing strolling around trying different street food
Food and Shopping heaven,Nothing can prepare you for when you step into this place. It can be a bit overwhelming at first cause there are a lot of happenings going on from one vendor selling something to people catching up to people watching while eating. Went down Myeondong station and tried looking for gate 8 since that was what we were told but we ended up going to gate 9 which was only a few walk to this place. Shopping heaven for both Make up and Food. One thing I learned from my trip is that it can get tempting to buy something since outside of a store a personnel can tempt you with freebies and who wouldnt love freebies but take a look around and compare with the other brands since some offer the same things at a cheaper price. The food I certainly enjoyed were the torched Scallops. and the skewers. There are a lot of ice cream places around the place worth to try since they come in cute sizes and forms but the taste was nothing great but worth experiencing.
Nice,"Great place for shopping. cosmetics paradise. great place for snacking. foods are yummy. i like korean bbq. but the price for bbq here is higher than in itaewon. some of the sales girl or boy r friendly, esp if you are good look. sometimes they are not . sometimes they see ppl from your hair to your sandals or shoes. lol maybe too tired to explain the product thus they choose ppl in the market target. some speak english confusinglymyeongdong is kind of fashion street, so if u looks not up to date, some korean ppl may see u like if you were not there. overall its a must to visit in korea"
busy street with tourist,"It has different kind of food ,clothing,handbag stalls along the way. If you enjoy shopping,you will love this place."
Be prepared to be overwhelmed!,"I had a good time, I knew stores would be repeated on several other streets as I walked along. I did find some good deals...however, it to me, was a tourist trap. I mean the streets were wall to wall with people. And I was there during chuseok, a national holiday. I shudder to think what it is like normally. I stayed within walking distance so I was able to shop in other areas and compare what the prices were in Myeongdong. So that was a definite plus, as soon as you say well I am staying here and the price I saw there was...well you've got bargaining power. Make sure you check out MK labs - the troiareuke brand in Myeongdong - exit 9 I believe. I got amazing deals on some serious great skincare."
Don't miss,"Don't miss for your shopping, many brand that you looking for are available here. Sport shoes and many kind of street foods are fantastic. "
Shopping paradise,Wonderful street shopping for cosmetics or clothes - trendy area and very clean area - lots of alley for you to walk around
Shoping,"A large amount of the store, of all types and prices, affordable but not cheap, easy access via subway, we recommend you visit not to give up"
More lively at night,Majority are cosmetics shops and a variety of food and good restaurantsFood and clothing cart vendors will only open at night
Not so quality items,"Crowded. Good for shopping no doubt, cheap but you need to bargain the price. Quality of goods are not up to the mark."
Tourism and shoppiñg,"Great place for shopping. I bought a suitcase, Sox and various other things. It was fun walking through. Lots of Street food too."
Shopping site that cannot be missed !!!,"This is a place where shoppers must must must go for all the cosmetics and skin care that the Koreans are famous for .There are plenty of clothing stores there as well but the main draw to me, would be the enormous number of cosmetics shops available there . It's definitely cheaper than Singapore by at least 30 percent . And the free samples that the shop provides give u a high ! Plenty to eat around there as well. And we have gone for massages in the same area for around 40000 won for 1 hour. "
Shopping Haven,This plaves encompasses a wide area. Mostly famous Korean cosmetic brands and international clothes stores. There are also many street stalls selling either food or cheap socks/shirts/caps/toys. Restaurants and cafes are located down the many side streets. It gets very crowded and the atmosphere is hectic.
One of the best shopping districts ,"There are tons of shops that sell brand name cosmetics, clothing & shoes. Also, there are tons of restaurants, a few of department stores & theaters! The shopping lover must visit!!"
Shopping!!!,lots of food options along this stretch of the street. very busy street throughout the day and even till night time. you will not regret!
Wear comfortable shoes,"There is no quick and easy way around Myeongdong. One must walk and walk and walk to fully appreciate. And this is not just one street. It is one main street with multiple side streets, all full of shops and restaurants. Much to see but it must be noted that there are some stores with multiple branches in this area. Of course bring cash (or a credit card). Credit cards are universally accepted. For the srious shoppers, 3-4 hours is a good amount of time to spend."
Fun street to explore,"Myeongdong Shopping street is a shopping haven beside the Myeongdong station that is filled with local Korean makeup brands (Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Missha, Innisfree, Face Shop, Etude House, Holika Holika) that offer discounts when products bought cost over 30000 KRW, shoe brands (Footlocker, NB, Nike, Onitsuka Tiger) and other closing stores. Along the street are food stalls that sell all kinds of Korean street foods. "
Regret if you missed Myeongdong shopping street!!!!,"This shopping area that you cannot missed at Seoul! Men or Women, young or old sure can grab something for yourself from head to toes! Prices are reasonable, most importantly is 'Made in Korea'!"
A busy place buzzing with activity,Amazing amount of shops and market stalls.You can pick up most things here in every price range.A lot of weird and wonderful characters going about
You will NOT walk away empty handed and hungry along this street ,"This is one of the busiest shopping area for tourists. Beauty products and shops lined up in rows and alleys. Local apparel and shoes stores sprinkled in different corners of the street. You find the latest design of adidas and other popular sneakers here too ! Push carts of food lined the main Myeongdong street starting from the Zara stores. We have an enjoyable time on Saturday trying tibits and food along this street. Don't take a heavy lunch. You just buy and eat from the push cart. They are hygienic at least for me and my Friend. We were fascinated by a push cart that sell nothing but just Optus and cuttle fish in various form ( grilled, dried and in a cup etc. We tried the pomegranate juice freshly pressed into a plastic bag and a straw. It looks like a fresh blood bag from a blood bank. But the taste is not as sweet as during winter. We also shop along the way and got bags full of different Brand’s of facial cleansers, masks and facial mist, hair masks etc. There was a Watson store that sell interesting tibits and cosmetic too(items which you can't find in singapore but expensive when purchase online. A lot of eateries are on the second and 3rd stories of the buildings. Fried chicken, Korean food, Osulloc tea cafe, beer and fried chicken place. This is a must go place for whoever comes to Seoul. Just to feel the vibe and craziness of the buying bulk of skin care products from tourists from all over the world. I see more European tourists hovering around the snail based skin care and masks products. Seems like snail is not just for eating, it is for beauty too ! "
Makeup and street food mecca,"We stayed at K guesthouse premium which is located in the middle of Myeongdong Shopping street.but since we had our own itinerary,we werent able to really spend some more time within the area as we have scheduled tours to different parts of Seoul. As a result, i was in a hurry shopping and buying makeup items. Good thing i did my research before flying to seoul so its easier for me to shop for makeup items that i want. Its true that they give freebies. Actually, they give freebies to any branch but I can say that the Holika holika shop in Hongdae gave the most number of freebies. I was quite dissappointed at first but when i saw my haul, i think i got more freebies overall than the main make up and skin care items i got! Also, if you really stroll the streets,you are going to see clothing items from 3600-20k. Imagine, its super cheap! Also, almost all the western and foreign brands are here such as h&m,forever 21, uniqlo,zara,etc are here. These stores are BIG so u know u can shop BIG TIME!! To top it all, try the fastfoods and restaurans here esp the James cheese ribs! I swear to all the gods, you are gonna love it! As in superrrr! Oh wait, dont miss the street foods too because you have to try every single one of them esp the desserts like ice cream waffle and red bean strawberry mochi! Enjoy seoul! "
Place to stay when in Seoul,"Myeongdong is the place to stay in when visiting Seoul. Its what Shibuya or Shinjuku is for Tokyo. It got the shopping, the street food and is central located to give easy access ot the rest of Seoul. the neighborhood itself is filled with cosmetic/beauty shops and stores aimed for younger people. During the evening the streets fills up with food carts and the place is also packed with restaurants and coffee places. Its also close to Lotte Flagship Department store and the two metro lines gives easy access to the rest of the city. So this is not only a great place for shopping and visiting at nights, but also an excellent point to have as a base since most of the city is within 15 minutes."
Nice Place to Shopping but very Rude people,"Love the shopping shop and environment, but they have the same brand in most of every street.Also most of local people is very rude and not helpful."
Very crowded.,"There are a lot of stores !!!! If you want to buy something when you see it, just buy it. It is very difficult to walk back and find them again. The time I went there it was so crowded. If you go with your children, please take care of them really well holding the hands all the time. "
A shopping paradise,"Shops and shops and shops..... Mostly cosmetics. And in the evening the road is filled with many stalls selling street foods, interesting sight. "
Interesting Area,Nice little area with tons of small flea market style carts set up. We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed with people. Didn't find anything really interesting. Make sure you bring cash with you as we did not find an ATM anywhere and none of the vendors will take credit.
Lots of fun!,"Definitely worth a visit for any tourist in Seoul. Weekends are especially fun, because it is very busy and there are lots of food vendors on the streets. Have a walk around and peruse all the different vendors before deciding what to get - there are lots of options. For anyone interested in Asian cosmetics Myeongdong is heaven. Multiple locations of each major brand (Etude House, Innisfree, Banila, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, etc). Also some smaller brands that you may not find elsewhere. Most of the sales girls speak English, so it's nice if you're looking for help or recommendations. You will also generally get the most samples from Myeongdong cosmetics stores. Overall, something to do for everyone in Myeongdong!"
Night market ,Lot of people and stalls at late night. Most cosmetics here are sold in bundles and you can save a lot also some stores give out giveaways. Make sure to try out the street foods they sell here. Good for shopping.
Very busy and basically the same shop over and over,A must if you like street food (which is amazing) and beauty supplies. but not for longer than a few hours. it's basically a million makeup shops - the same make up shops - smoshed together. 
Just love it,"This is an entire street of shopping from international brands, to local designer brands and low end brands. It offers plenty of restaurants, cafes, and street food all at the same time. Definately spoil for choice. Weekend can get really crowded. As a tourist this is a one stop place to shop till you drop. Shopping heaven a Must come destination when you are in Korea. "
Busy shopping strip with yummy street food,"We came here for dinner one night, yummy street food but not the cheapest dinner we had, same with the shopping, lots of the same stores repeated and not the cheapest. "
Shopping buzz,"We wandered the streets here as we had some spare time. If you are after Korean cosmetics this is the place to go as there were a multitude of shops, with some duplicated not far from each other. There was plenty of Street food available and cafes and restaurants however we opted to eat at the food Hall of Lotte mall which is close by"
Too much and all the same,Too much shops and many brands have more than one shop in the area. And they all offer quite the same. Very crowded. Watching people while they are shopping is entertainment as well 
"Food Carts, People, Cosmetics and Clothes","I went with my family to experience the street food culture. Because we were there for only one night we tried a variety of foods. None of them were amazing sadly.The best (to me) being the deep fried shrimp 새우튀김. The worst beight either the cup 'o flaverless watermelon or the chewy and flavorless Cheese Ricecake 치즈떡.Being a holiday weekend, the street was crawling with tourists. I think I heard WAY more Chinese than Korean, not that its a good or bad thing. Also, it feels that the stores in Myeongdong cater to young female shoppers. Being a guy in his 30's there was really nothing for me to shop for.Also, not a great place to bring young children because of the crowd and lack of things that interest them.If your on a date, maybe a great place to check out."
Skin care stor is everywhere...,This street is heaven for women.. The store is everywhere... For the man this street have adidas store.. Very busy street and theres so may sreetfood and the price start from 3000won
Go for the street food at night,"Unlike large cities in Asia like Manila, Tokyo, Bangkok, Seoul is much like Singapore which is compact and all within reach. If you decide to live in #myeongdong (dong means district) and woth a good pair of shoes you can practically walk to buk(meaning north)son and climb Nam(south)san Tower. But the best part of my experience are the streetfood. I ignored the shops at Myeongdong and at around 5 pm the food vendors starts to setup and that's when the experience truly begins. Here's a tip: come hungry and sample them all in small bites but bring lots of ""won"" or cash as the cost does rack up. I've only been to two of them and next time, forget the historic and k-drama scenes and just check them all out."
Mrs Vena Ng ,"Good location ; near subway; surrounded by good restaurants, many skin care products. Many street food. "
Crowded and Colorful ,"One of the most famous streets of Seoul. Very crowded and offers lots of different services at once from local food to clothes, toys, skincare products or whatever you could think of. It is highly enjoyable to let yourself flow with the crowd and enjoy different colors and sounds of the street. Easy to reach with Metro. "
Shopping Paradise ,"As for me, Myeongdong is a great place for shopping. You can find here almost everything: from the traditional Korean street food till the brand clothes from all over the world. I like this place for many cosmetic shops and ability to use not only Korean and English languages, but also Chinese. People are friendly and ready to help or give you an advice.It is also easy to exchange money or use your bank card. + Myeongong is close to Namsan Tower and the city center. "
The Shops Repeat Itself,"I'm not much of a cosmestics enthusiast, which is the main reason I found Myeongdong a tad underwhelming.There are plenty of cosmestic shops, but after a while you realize there's another outlet of the same chain 4 stores down, and another and another. Of course, there weren't only cosmestics. Clothing, shoes, souveniers, etc were all available too."
Real shopping Seoul,This shopping street is crowded with both tourists and local people who seek for nice shopping place. The whole shopping area may cover around 4 sq.km. and you can waste all your day end up shopping here. There are also 4-5 shopping mall around the shopping main street. You may face Korean street somehow if you have luck and it is very nice experience.
Its nice,This area (more than just this street) is full of higher and high end shops. It was nice but I just didn't love it. I was not buying anything so maybe that makes a difference. Plus I think its better at night.
Great Shopping area,It is a great area for shopping in Seoul..where you can find korean cosmetics for skin and hair and the famous korean gensing roots..also you can buy clothes with average prices..not too cheap but in the same time not too expensive..you Will spend great time there...really worth it..after finishing you can ride up from there to Namsan cable car and go for a tour to seoul tower..
Best known korean shopping street,"If you are looking for shopping, this is the place to be: shops, department stores, etc. You will be able to spend full days to spend your money."
"nice, a lot of interesting things","Myeongdong is every shopaholics dream with stores that will cater to everyone’s taste that it’s hard to leave without purchasing something, If shopping just isn't your thing than Myeongdong also have many restaurants and street vendors around every corner. Make sure to explore every nook and cranny as you might miss out on something special."
"For shopper and foodies, it's a heaven","I love street food, don't have high standard for it. So I love street food so much! Here myeongdong is the heaven of street food! It was so fun to choose what to eat and walking along the street and craving anything I see! Plus you can find so many Korean cosmetic shops which are all on sales! It made me crazy for shopping though...:)Good place to visit with your friends!"
Shopping Heaven,"When in Seoul, Myeongdong Shopping Market is something that you cannot missed. From simple korean street food to Kpop souvenirs and fashion can be found. The Korean brand cosmetics with very helpful sales staff are always there to assist when needed. I spent almost 3 day just roaming the streets and of course shopping therapy..... definitely a place to recommend. "
Tourists Everywhere.,"Being a tourist it was nice to shop the basic souvenirs bought in Korea but there were so many people from all over the world. It was almost overwhelming. In saying that, most places spoke broken English which was helpful. Street food is readily available which is nice too. (Chinese and Korean)"
Shop til you drop,"This place has got a vibe. Shoppers' heaven and also offers various food along the street for food lovers. Literally you can shop til you drop, but you can grab whatever you like on the way. It seems that it is almost always crowded til late."
Frenetic atmosphere,"Myeongdong is filled with shops selling beauty products, clothes, accessories, shoes. Young ladies stand outside store entrances offering beauty samples to draw you inside. Restaurants and coffee shops also beckon. It was a bit too frenetic and noisy for me, but if you're up to the challenge of finding more bargains, after having shopped at nearby Namdaemun market (10-15 minutes walk coming from the west), then this is the place for you. I preferred the quieter Shinsagae department store, as well as Lotte's basement food hall (both within easy walking distance)."
Shopping Heaven ♥,"to those who love skincares & cosmetics, you have to visit this street!!!!but the street food is kinda expensive tho, u can get cheaper street food at other market or street.varieties of brands you can find at here, not only shoes, there have clothing stores and Big MCM store oso there!!"
Sh0ppers delight,"Vast number of shops, especially makeup and cosmetics and clothing. There are both high and low-end shops"
Wonderful family summer experience!,"It was our first family trip to S Korea and we picked Myeondong because of the positive review's from TripAdvisor. We picked Philstay명동 hotel which was ideally located in the Myeondong area, no frills nothing fancy as we were on a budget. The reviews/reviewers for spot on Myeondong is basically a huge shopping paradise ranging from inexpensive item's to upscale name brand's. Huge plus was that were on our hotel was on the street where they have the street foods at night, everything was so affordable around $5 or less and so delicious and so much variety. I would absolutely recommend experiencing this area of Myeondong to anyone!"
Beauty products galore,"Place to stock up on your beauty products, there are brands like Laneige, Nature Republic, Skin Food, Face Shop, Etude house and the list goes on. There is a Shinsegae dept store (more luxury branded ) too. If you get any beauty products, usually the stores will give u some samples or they call it ""service"". "
Fun place,"The streets are lined with many shops and restaurants.Great place for cosmetics, accesories, shoes. A lot of street food. Naemdum market and Lotte store are also close by."
Super super super su~~~per crowded,"I could see wave of people there, it's too much so I got scared to get inside literally but you can find many street food and shops, it seems you can get everything there! Oh it has good restaurants,too Myeongdong gyoja, andong jjimdak, maple tree house, meoksidonna-Ddeokbboggi restaurant! Try them! they are really good! :) "
Walking street for tourists,"Tourists everywhere (esp. Mainland China). Large open-air walking streets. Mostly Korean-brand cosmetics at 'heavily discounted tourist prices' (meaning if u buy more, u get better discounts or freebies). Good place to savour local snacks & food from make-shift stalls & carts. Easily accessible via subway."
Not a shopper. But it's got everything you need. ,"This is a place for shopaholics. The street food area is quite good, a variety of foods. However it is quite overpriced compared to the rest of Korea. Its not a tourist spot in terms of seeing anything interesting. Just shopping. And the main drawback is its always crazy packed. If you want calm come in the early morning. "
Overrated,"The skincare shops that can be found here are easily available in many different districts such as Hongdae and Edae. From what I observed, the sales people in Myeongdong are a lot pushier too, especially if they think that you're from China. Worth the visit for the experience but you can easily shop at other districts."
Paradise for beauty products lovers,Many beauty shops and cafe! Or if you just want to enjoy the surrounding you can walk and try street food. Easy to reach by train or bus.
Myeondong,"Have had an amazing time traveling :) myeongdong is great for shopping for skincare products, full of great restaurants and coffee shops, and of course you can find a lot of delicious street food:) a place where you would see people from all over the world and have an awesome time shopping! "
a go to place for those who LOVE beauty products,"As expected, it was a mecca of beauty shops, some designer brands, with a sprinkling of a few department stores (Lotte and Shinsegae),a music store and coffee shops. I enjoyed shopping here to my heart's content. The atmosphere has an energetic vibe especially at night when the street is filled with young couples and those who want to spend some time with their friends after school or work (20's-30's)Myeongdong shopping street is a 2-3 minute walk from Pacific hotel which was very near where we were staying. It was December when we visited and at night, there were a few carts selling delicious street food so we practically lined up behind the locals and enjoyed piping hot food."
busy street to feel the vibe and do shopping at the same time,"jostle with the crowd ... try the street stalls or cafes, dinner at restaurants.. u name it.. fast fashion, shoes, accessories, best for beauty care shopping (aim for those with direct tax refund, saves the hassle at airport).Service is not as warm now (I must say) as they don't really need to woo you for business. there is also the myeongdong theatre if you would like to catch any performances in the city."
Amazing food and fun,"My husband and I had so much fun experiencing the Myeongdong Shopping Street, which we stumbled upon after leaving dinner on our first night heading back to our hotel (we stayed at the Lotte Hotel Seoul). The first night, we simply walked through and saw all the amazing good and ended up getting fried ice cream even though we were stuffed from dinner. We ate dinner here one night and everything was delicious. It was hard to decide what to try because everything looked so good. Definitely experience this street, even if it's just to look! There are many shops and stores in this area too!"
Love this dynamic street,"Myeongdong is like Shinsaibashi and Dotonburi in Osaka, but it mix together in 1 street (area), not like in Osaka which separated by a river (2 street).Lively, urban soul, lot of stores (local and international brand), restaurant and my favourites, FOOD STALL.Sausages, deep fried crab, grilled shrimp, grilled octopus, ice cream, dessert and many more.Like my advice for Dotonbori, it's better you spend 1 day to try all the type of food stall, while enjoying this dynamic street. They will give you different sensation than just eating at the restaurant.Direction to this attraction : use subway and stop at Myeongdong station (exit 6).Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Wow! Great local food with variety to overwhelm,"I very much liked the atmosphere and the vibe. Amazed by wonderful food stalls, many halal items (e.g. corn, egg bun (the one without pork), fried bananas, pomengranat juice, potatos, lobster tail, ice creams with honey..etc).Fantastic place - not to be missed!Enjoy :)"
Busy street,"Busy and crowded, but much to see if you stop up. A lot of restaurants in the buildings over the shops. Not many places to stop and sit out. Try the street food!"
My Myeondong.,"This location have a lot of restaurant, shop and street food. I like street food at Myeondong street. Have a many clothes for select. Moreover, have hotel and guest house that near with street. So comfortable transportation when I shopping to late at night and easy to walk to back at hotel."
Mainly for Chinese toursits,"A very lively and energetic market place, is definitely fun to witness whilst your stay in Seoul, but.... it's very obvious that the shops are targeting Chinese tourists?There's even shop staff yelling in Chinese about a sale of something.It's still worth a visit but you wouldn't be thrilled."
Paradise,"High concentration of Korean skincare, make up stores and sports shoes than clothes.Word of advice is to ensure you have some orientation as you will see the same brand appearing here and there and after shopping for awhile you might lose your way.At night time, all the street foods are out and there is a good selection but as we were already been stuffing ourselves with proper meals, there was no room for more snacks.Shopping hours roughly from 10 or 11am to 10.30pm ish but best to check the store first."
A heaven for girls,They have all brand of korea comestic in this place. The product are cheap especially when there is a promotion. This place have many local street food but quite pricy compare to their local market. But its worth to try. You can walk whole day in this area if you have enough money~ The disadvantage is this place have too many people.
"Not Authentic, Overprices, full of cosmetics","This shopping area can be skip to my opinion, nothing special over here, the university shopping street is much better,"
One of the best places in Seoul!,"Place where you can find both locals and tourists. Amazing shopping street with many (most of them budget) brands. An especially good place to explore the Korean beauty brands, like Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Laneige, Skinfood, Etude House etc, which are considered some of the best in the world (and not expensive at all). The area is full of life and young people with amazing street food. Worth a visit!"
Lots of shops but crowded!!,"You'll find it all here!! Cat cafe, dog cafe, street food, chain stores, and lots and lots of people!! Definitely touristy, but this is truly a shopper's paradise."
So much fun,"This place is the best for beauty products & street food.All the beauty product store you can imagine its all here. Its hard to resist not to go in and buy something. Street food starts at 2pm, come here on empty stomach and try all the food. Came here 3x in the evening and we always come out with full stomach and a smile in our face."
Vibrant street,"This is a place that you definitely cannot miss. It's a vibrant shopping street selling lots of varied stuff. Even if you don't like to shop, just go there and take a look to have a feel of Seoul."
Good shopping but....,Overall the shopping was excellent and there were a huge selection of food stalls to choose from. However due to the being the main shopping area for tourists it was very crowded and hard to move around at times. 
Shopping!!! Eating!!!,Here is the place for shopping and eating. This place is crowded. We went there at 10am and it was already crowded. Many cosmetics stores. There is also daiso. Many delicious local snacks and interested restaurant. You can also find line store in here.
A great place to buy Korean brand cosmetics.,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a great place to buy Korean brand cosmetics. During our 7 days trip in South Korea, my wife visited here more than thrice and at every visit she bought something. (We put up at a guesthouse which is at Myeongdong Shopping Street) The street food here is interesting and tasty too."
Shopping and street Foods!,"I love this part of Seoul! There are lots of shops and food places too, having you walking for hours and not notice the time. The fact we got free wifi on the streets was the highlight! The Shinsegae department store is awesome especially the directory and their restrooms. The under ground mall had many store keepers that were pushing us to buy clothes that we could get much cheaper in the US, which is closer to us. But that had free wifi too! There is one shop near one of the entrances that sold clothes at reasonable prices! All the western products were too expensive here!"
"Lots of shops, but really crowd","Myeongdong probability is the number one go-to place for international visitors with lots of shops, restaurants, and theater. but the place was packed with travelers at all time."
Worth a look,"I spent of couple of hours exploring the Myeongdong shopping district. There are a startling number of cosmetics stores - who knew that Korean ladies buy so many cosmetics?! Cosmetics aside, there's some interesting things to see, and there are many choices of places to eat. You must try an ice cream from Milky Bee! Most of the signage is in Korean which can make it difficult to fully see what's what if you don't read Korean. It's busy and buzzing and well worth a look. I spent about 2 hours there in all."
Crazy shopping bonanza,"If you are looking for a shopping and streetfood haven...this is it. From beauty products to clothes to yummy delicous korean streetfood, you'll spend hours walking and never even notice. Every square inch is filled with stores and people. Queues form on the most exceptional stores or restaurants. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking to shop and dine."
Korea Shopping Hot Spot,"You can find almos all stuff in this area. Popular korean cosmetic brand, Korean traditional stuff and traditional street food and much more"
Shopping Haven,"If you're all about make up and skin care, be prepared to splurge. Great finds and really cheap compared to UAE prices. Ask for freebies. Food stalls and restaurant are easy to find, long lines for the good ones. But some store closes early as 2100. An hour or two is not enough in this place."
Bustling with locals and tourists alike,"The shopping in Myeongdong evolves around skin care and beauty, name brands have several store fronts here. Fabulous customer support, great deals and street markets on weekends add to the ambience. A must-do when in Seoul!"
Cosmetic heaven,"Too many cosmetic shops!They have a lot of offers The sales persons standing in front of their shop promoting their products. If you are cosmetic fan, pls come here. You will see famous brand like nature republic, the face shop, skinfood having more than 2 stores in the same street. "
Great place to get original and very Korean stuff!,"This place is so fun. Best place for socks in Korea, which sounds weird but Korea has hilarious and interesting socks and you definitely will want to pick up a few pairs while you are here. There is also a great food market here which is amazing to see. The only thing about Myeongdong is you have to have TONS of time to search and always bargin! I believe the Korean term for 'give me a deal' is 'gacka juseyo!' which they find hilarious. I lived here 2014-2015 teaching English and made sure to bring my family here when they visited. Wear comfortable shoes and bring lots of cash! "
Most shops are repeated.,"My wife was attracted by great discount items outside one of the cosmetic shops. The shopkeeper asked us to go inside for more discount items, and that was a mistake, because my wife was persuaded to buy more expensive items, and we couldn't get receipts because the shopkeeper claim :"" you are getting many freebies"". After we bought our things, I found out that the items are slightly more expensive than Lotte duty free store even with ""freebies"", I shold have bought them at Lotte Duty Free Store because I would get discount with coupons I got from airport. To keep it simple, if you are tourists, visit Lotte Duty Free Store first before you go to the ina street to buy cosmetics, At least you take down the price at Lotte DFS for comparison. "
Seoul Tour ,There is nothing that you can not find in this market. Your family will love it. It has many cosmetics shops.
More and more varieties,"We have visited few times to Myeongdong. Each time we have gained different experiences. We could say it has progressed even to the street food...the varieties have been increased to different levels...like the rose gelato, ice-cream on the fish-shaped cone, grilled abalone, grilled shrimps...The new shopping malls and hotels create a new whole shopping experiences. It is a must go place in Seoul!"
Shopping paradise!!,"It was quite a pity though, I went on a rainy day and moods for shopping were just ruined :( So do check your weather forecast before heading out to Myeongdong! As the streets do not have shelter at all and it was so tiring to keep on opening and closing our umbrellas while visiting various shops. I believe almost all Korean Skincare/Beauty brands can be found in Myeongdong, from Skinfood, Banila Co, The Face Shop, Missha, Innisfree and many many more. Some shops even have duplicates in different alleys of Myeongdong! Theres also Aritaum(their Sephora in Korea) and Olive Young(their Watsons/Guardian in korea) 2 levels of it - which you can find Neogen, Son&Park and many types of 'smaller' korean brands haha. Clothing I did not really see, other than in the shopping malls which were H&M, Zara and other international brands which are a tad bit more expensive in Korea. "
Great Street Food Oasis!,"My friends certainly raved about the great cosmetics shopping adventure they had in Myeongdong Shopping Street, and the fact that they can use their debit cards issued by Philippine banks. Such convenience won't go unnoticed by travelers, who does not bring so much won with them, or who have ran out of won and had to look for money changers. As for me, I had a delightful gastronomic adventure in this shopping mecca. We didn't go to any special restaurants or cafes to fill our bellies; we just went looking for the food kiosks that sell street food we have not tried before. If you're adventurous enough in what you're eating, I recommend for you to try the (1) soft and moist egg muffin, (2) fish cake on stick with a little paper cup of soup to go with it to keep you warm, and (3) Hoddeok, which is like a pan cake that has sweet filling inside and fried crispy on the outside served to you in a paper cup.Even if it's filled with Koreans and tourists, there's room for everyone in Myeongdong, and people are very friendly and accommodating. I'm waiting to go back to Korea and to Myeongdong again :) Who know, it's going to be soon! "
Impressed for the Korean foods,"It's winter time to visit Souel.The white snow is like the ladies skin color. This is a fashion chic and pop cultural area. Very impressed with their creative ability. I found out that KOrean are also very active for their fashion, designs, foods culture.If you want to see the trendy fashion, then this is it. Trying some awesome local foods, sea foods and enjoy the fashion aroma there."
There’s always something to experience for everyone at Myeongdong,"Of the 4 days my family and I spent at Seoul, we spent 2 evenings and an afternoon at Myeongdong Shopping District. It is at evening when not only is it cooler but also where the whole place becomes vibrant with the street (makeshift) vendors plying their trade and where the place becomes expectantly crowded. Shopping experience: This is a shoppers’ paradise for mainly mid-price items – Korean beauty products, ie cosmetics, skincare, facial masks (Innisfree, Laneige etc), bags, clothing, shoes, socks, accessories, spectacles, music etc . There are several huge department stores (e.g. Uniqlo, H&M, Lotte).Dining/Food experience: Again, this is a diners’ paradise. There are countless eateries and restaurants. For dinner, we ate omelette rice, pork cutlet rice and noodles at a Korean restaurant (it’s got a phrase “名人since 1976”).Myeongdong is home to numerous shops serving wonderful desserts – we ate green tea ice cream and green tea roll cake at O Sulloc Teahouse (next to McDonalds). We also ate the fabulous Strawberry Sherbert with daifuku (mochi filled with sweet red bean) and Injeolmi Toast at the popular Korean Dessert Café Sulbing. Sulbing (translated as “snow ice”) is similar to the traditional Korean dessert bingsu, but instead of using ice, frozen milk is used as the shaving block, which gives the dessert an incredible smooth and fluffy texture as well as a rich, creamy and sweet flavour. From the evening street vendors, you have to try the 32cm ice cream (in green tea vanilla, chocolate vanilla, strawberry yogurt etc. flavours) in a cone (2000 won) or in a cup (3000 won) and the egg bread (“gyeran- ppang” in Korean) which is a popular street snack in South Korea.Cultural experience: Besides the shopping and dining experiences, not many foreign tourists know about the free rental of the traditional Korean costume (hanbok) and photography experience at the Seoul Global Cultural Centre located on the 5th Floor of the M-Plaza. You have to reserve your slot for the same day. While we were there, this hanbok experience was only available from Monday to Thursday. This is because it’s substituted with ‘Descendants of the Sun’ military uniform experience from Friday to Sunday. So don’t miss Myeongdong’s shopping, dining and cultural experiences when you are in Seoul! And I recommend you stay in a hotel that’s within walking distance so that you don’t have to carry those shopping bags for too long (We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Seoul Euljiro which is within 15 minutes’ walk to Myeongdong)."
FAVORITE SHOPPING AREA!,"I've visited Hongdae, Myeongdong, and Gangnam, and Myeongdong is by far my favorite neighborhood. To start, Hongdae has many food stops and sells mostly off brand clothing. Myeongdong has multiple stores as well as a huge variety of street food along every large street. Gangnam is much more modern and gives an upper class vibe, since the streets are cleaner and it's not as freely chaotic as Myeongdong.For me, Myeongdong was the perfect balance of Seoul's street culture as well as their huge options of clothes and skin care products. It's really fun seeing one skin care store within a 5 minute walking distance of each other.Myeongdong is lively at night, so make sure you get a chance to get at that time too!"
Where markets meet department stores.. With amazing street food!,"If you love local street food, this is the place. It is exit 6 from Myeongdong station. Has a few good souvenir markets as well as great big stores e.g Zara, converse etc. Great place, super good vibe!"
Best Street Food,"Looking for local delicacies or just everyday foods; walk down the many streets in the Myeondong. The food stalls are neatly placed and organised and the food is fresh and delicious. Locals are always happy to see a tourist taste their foods, makes the experience even more fun. Enjoy!"
Shopping place,"This is definitely a shopping place, for food , clothes, comestic etc there are night market u can explore the food while shopping. Not too bad, is a commercial shopping street, nothing to expect."
Shoppers paradise,"This is where it's all happening for shoppers and food lovers. There are thousands of shops for cosmetic products and a cosmetic solution for everything under the sun. Apparels, shoes, accessories, etc are also all available and enough restaurants ranging from Korean, Chinese and Italian fare. By evening the street vendors change the landscape and you get throat interesting things and bargains on the streets. The street food has too many options and temptations. This street is a must do. It portrays the energy, vibrancy and hustle and bustle of Seoul. And yes! Do bargain on the streets. I bought a huge suit case for half the quoted price! "
Best shopping street! Must visit!!,"I had a great experience. During the day can be a bit humid, but with so many stores to go visit you won't notice. The stores range from forever 21 and Zara to skincare such as Innisfree, and Holika Holika. Also, in the third floor of the Innisfree building there is a KPOP Music store! At night, the best part was the street food and the different vendors that come to sell their goods. Also, I found some cute souvenirs to bring back home to family and friends! Highly Recommended!! "
Huge collections of skincare shops,"There are so many skincare products sold here and eventho it's for the same brand like for example, nature republic, some of the shop sell the products with different price tags. Go to few places to get cheaper stuff and with immediate tax refund. "
A morning of Shopping at Myeongdong,You can't find the deals you use to get there but for a great sighting seeing visit you have to include Myeongdong Shopping Street. If you take your time and wonder through the variety of shops and stalls you can find a deal or two. I still go there just for the people watch and you are very close to the 'South Gate' another cool photo background
No need to describe for this all time shopping and food paradise,"A must go shopping area in Seoul! Lots of cosmetics, clothes, shoes, bags as well as food stalls, desserts cafe and restaurants. Anything you want, you name it! Myeongdong is open until very late at night so you can enjoy it at the fullest."
"Shops, shops, shops...","This is the street to stay and shop. Great atmosphere, incredible night markets and dozens of different foods to try."
So so,After having so much recommendation to come here I didn't manged to buy much stuff expect face products. And maybe due to high volume of tourists shop assistant are basically rude. I would rather go elsewhere which really gave me tons of samples and good services.
Convenient for Shopping,"Extremely busy place whether day or night filled with places to shop and to eat. All the popular brands of clothing, skincare, makeup, drugstore from korea are place together for your convenience. Due to the high density of tourists in the area, everyone in the shop can assist you in english, chinese and etc. but be warned its so full of tourists im not sure if this place is ""Korean"" anymore. "
Cosmetic and facial product paradise,This is a great place to shop for cosmetic and facial product which is another shopping paradise for ladies. There are a lot of street food available along the stretches of shops as well. Be sure to check this place out.
"Make up, face masks..","You will find endless of make up, face masks, body cream etc in this street. Almost all Korean brands have a presence here. They will give you free gifts here too. Most are able to speak Chinese and little English."
All I dreamed of and more,Shopping for korean beauty products with my friends was one of our primary motivators to come to Seoul for the first time. Myendong is a shoppers heaven. It does get crowded the later in the day you go but many of the shops are open late and have multiple locations of the same brands. Make sure to allot lots of time here if that's what you're looking for. Also good food and some fun salons. Can't wait to go back
Cool Place,Myeongdong is very busy and at night with all the neon lights it is quite an experience. The shops all stay open late and it's always packed with people. There are shops here for every taste!
Cosmetic Nirvana!,"So many cosmetic shops here. There are many of the same brand along the mall & amazingly they all seemed to be packed with customers. Most of the shops give out freebie samples if you buy something Go in the evening to soak up the atmosphere. Street food,market stalls & crowds!"
Perspective of Korea,"Having walked around for quite some time, finding something different every time you take a turn, this is truly a culinary & cultural marvel! The street food is fantastic & tasty, communication is sometimes difficult trying to determine what some of the foods are comprised of, doing your homework before hand does help.A must visit if in Seoul."
The Best of SEOUL ,"This is a nice place for shopping and having many scrumptious korean food! Besides, this place strategy to stay, shop and entertainment "
Shop till you drop,Great shopping district with the major department stores (Lotte and Lotte Young) among others as well as all of the speciality shops.Also near the Namdaemun Markets and with its fair share of restaurants. Transforms at night with a lot of street stalls. Plenty of good hotels in the area.
cosmetic heaven,"Myeongdong is probably the biggest shopping district I have ever seen! So many streets lined with cosmetic and fashion stores, we went during the summer sales so every store had discounted products. The shop assistants are very friendly and helpful with explaining what each product is for, but they can be quite pushy. The street food vendors come out at about 4:30pm and the shops are open until about 9 or 10pm. We spent hours here and I still feel like I could go back and see/shop some more!"
Great place but certainly crowded,"One of the best places in Seoul for shopping, shops at every turn, with many restaurant options. Check around for different prices at the shops as they may vary"
Myeondong – persuasions,"It’s where Asian tourists go for their made-in-Korea beauty products supply. All the known stores are here, every other corner, bustling till almost midnight in summer. The sales people only persuade passersby. If you have something in mind, well you can get it here, free samples included. BB, CC, DD creams anyone? I think price wise, they cost as much as what you may get online, plus the postage. Perhaps the supplies are “fresh”. There are stalls selling food (grilled octopus, pancakes etc.), drinks (fresh fruit), socks (animated), clothings etc. I have been here at different periods - in March, June, August, September and October - it’s more lively during the summer, more stalls too. Plus, you may stop by any one of the cafes (many) here for a Bingsoo, but not in October. There is an Artbox store around the corner too, if you get tired of the beauty products and would like some “unusual” gifts for yourself or someone else – browse is the word."
Must go ,Very popular for shopping lovers. I love Korea as a country and shopping is great here. Lots of young up to date fashion. Great street food. Very Korean exciting samosa here 
Convenient for buying Korean cosmetics ,"Very convenient for buying Korean cosmetic brands - many stores of the same brand within walking distance of one another. Take your time to test out products and the staff are usually very helpful ( if you speak Mandarin, staff can give product information in more details). Always ask for more freebies if you intend to buy larger quantities.If you shop at Aritaum, Olive Young, Innisfree and Too cool for School and purchase at least KRW30,000, you get immediate tax refund off your purchase price- so no need to claim tax refund at airport. But do confirm at the cashier before making payment. The food stalls at the shopping street are not cheap and quality so-so. Better off saving the money and eating at more established and quality eateries in vicinity.There are many stores of established hair salon chains in the area where you can rest and do your hair in between shopping. There should usually be someone who can speak Mandarin ( I went to a salon early one morning and the Mandarin speaking staff wasn't around and they telephoned a translator to speak with me so they could understand what style I wanted(nothing Beats showing them a picture though ) - talk about service !) or very basic English. Prices are not much more expensive than Singapore. "
Lovely shopping district,Shopping haven with many restaurants.At night it is transformed into foodstreet. Yummy! You can spend a whole day in this maze.
The place for Beauty Products Fanatics,"The whole street is full with Beauty products shop. Look for promotion items such 1+1 which could be very cheap. There will be multiple stores with the same brands along the street as well. My friend told me (as I am not good in buying beauty products) that the price here for brands like The Face Shop and Nature Republic is cheaper than their branch in Malaysia. I went there twice, in the morning and evening. In the morning the certain shops open as early as 9 a.m. and there were not many people. When I came again in the evening, there were a lot of stalls along the streets selling street foods, clothes, socks. If you are ever run out of money, there are several ATM there that accept internationally activated ATM card and money changers are also abundant. However be careful of any suspicious people who suddenly come and be extra friendly to you. We were approached by scammers asking for donation before promoter of a shop there came and scolded them off."
A bustling place full of activities and crowd!,"Myeongdong is the No.1 most popular and must visit place in Seoul for shopping and food. Be it day or night, this place is always packed with people, especially the young and bustling activities. In fact, the later the night, the more people and packed it would be. Its not uncommon for one to ""push"" his way through the crowd.One can easily shop till drop here, especially for ladies, with rows of shops of cosmetics and skincare products plying along the lanes with promoters of each standing at the entrance shouting and yelling! Next, there are also lots of makeshift stalls selling fashion, shoes, costume jewelry, bags and shoes etc and of course not forgetting the food and beverages.There are also huge departmental stores (i.e. Lotte) here mainly selling fashion, shoes, cosmetics and gifts. Many cafes, desserts and restaurant outlets are located here as well and you will be spoilt for choice.Prices here are generally higher than at other places as its a touristy area unless shops running attractive promotions.Many hotels are located here or nearby as well and also very accessible as the Myeongdong train station is right here!For ladies this place can be your paradise but for men, maybe a bit boring other than eating but its still good to experience its fun, crowdedness and ambience. People who think the night/street markets in Hong Kong or Taiwan are huge or crowded, think twice as in terms of crowd turnout and magnitude, this place is definitely TOP!Well, a gentle reminder when shopping here. Still need to be careful for pickpockets though I feel very safe here unlike in other places.Good to visit!"
"If you love shopping, this is the place to be",This shopping area has everything you could possible want. There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants as well. You can get a 1/2m whippy ice cream. Not so great on a hot sunny date it melts making a bit of a mess. Great anyway.
A shopping paradise,Any Korean made skin care that you want is here. Lots and lots of them and lots and lots of restaurants and Korean street food available at night.
Busy!,The usual high end shopping but beware of people fiddling with their phone and colliding with each other. Lots of choice but tends to be on the expensive side for some Europeans.
"Very lively, lots of street food that looks yummy and skin care shops that also look yummy !","Very lively, lots of street food that looks yummy and skin care shops that also look yummy ! Go there in the evening."
The fashion street of Seoul,This market offers a wide variety of excellent options for cosmetics and clothing.Its a hub for the latest clothing trends of Korea and gives a snapshot of the apparel choice of Koreans.The street also has lots of street food options and the place is always buzzing.
Halal options available!,"Best place to shop for skincare products and cosmetics. Ensure you have a luggage with you but if you don't, they do sell luggages at the subway station. Some cosmetic shops have promotion giving away luggage if you spent a certain amount. Food stalls will be opened later part of the day. There are Halal options available! Only thing is that rubbish bins are difficult to find but the place is still clean. Do carry with you extra plastic bag to throw the rubbish first while looking for rhe thrash bin. "
"Very crowded, cheap stuff and street food! ","This place is bustling with people especially after sunset. Has lots of cheap stuff like shoes, bags, souvenirs. However, quality is bad! Street food didn't look great and didn't have the guts to try it (possibility of getting sick). My wife told me make up and beauty products were good and reasonable prices. Again, you can visit one time for the experience of crowded and cheap stuff, however, I'm not sure if I'll visit again..."
Lots of Shops,"There were several shops, restaurants, massage parlors, and other kind of shops. Very cool place to eat, shop, or even relax."
My God!!!!!!!,"This district was a shocker to me. I didnt expect that much in one particular district. If you into food, fashion in a Asian style environment, please experience Myeondong!!! "
Cosmetics street,"Almost every cosmetics shops are collected here. Same as other shopping streets, you can also find 3C gadgets equipments, hats, clothes and other accessories here. "
"If you just want to choose one place to shop, this is it.","They have almost every brand that you like here. BUt due to enormous tourist, the price is higher at many restaurant and street stall. You can get a much cheaper food at other place in Seoul but if you are tourist, you were meant to be coned. Everywhere the sales speaks chinese...."
Wide variety,"Stores have salespeople trying to tease you inside, good street food, wide variety of food & shopping, too few trash cans, so people litter on windowsills, etc. "
Just as advertised!,"This is a very fun place to visit, we were there on a Sunday, ad, most of the time, we felt we were the only non-locals there. Cosmetic stores are dominant. Important to note: IT IS OPEN ON SUNDAYS! I mention this because many sites and searches say it is closed on Sundays. Not true. A fun, vibrant experience. Take cash."
Fabulous place for shoppers ,"Just opposite my hotel, open at 10am-9.30pm most of the shops operating hours. My teen age boys were so happy here and grabs almost everything things and my wife too. Restaurant branded shops and streets food were set up at 4pm. "
Great experience ,"Nice shopping area with various types of things to buy, great price range so anybody can meet his shopping budget. Nighttime visit and Street food are must "
"many shops, street food","It's a big shopping area and you can buy a lot of different street food here. But compared to other places the street food here is quite expensive. And it's extremly crowded. It was raining when i was walking through this street and still there were a lot of people. YOu should try the fish shaped ice-cream. Most of the street food you can get it everywhere, but this one is rare, no idea why."
Preferred to a mall,"I like to walk around a shopping street. Our Korean friend took us to a mall Coex but it seemed like the buyers prefer European fashion brands. To see the street, feel the city I enjoyed the Myeondong street a lot more. Not so much for the countless skin-product offers but more for the street food and the flow & flair."
Always busy,"It is always crowded and there is so much to do. Whenever I go I go in the morning and I basically spend all day there. There is so many stores and so many places where you can eat, also the street food is amazing.. If you're lucky you will also get a lot of samples from different shops, and you do not have to buy anything. I was always too shy and I would try to avoid them, because it feels like they're pressuring you into buying things, haha. but if you have a strong will, go ahead and explore the place!"
"Great place to shop, eat and drink.","Myeongdong is great because every brand, albeit big or small, gathers on a relatively small area, enough to satisfies all kinds of customers' needs.Myeongdong has all the high-street brands like Zara, H&M, Forever21, you name them. These shops are located all over the place, and pretty easy to find. Just stick to the main street you're gonna find all of them.You will find local brands like Top 10, Gentle Monster too.Skin care/cosmetic brands from Laneige, Whoo, Sulwhasoo, Hera, etc.Be cautious if you were to plan to shop at NATURE REPUBLIC. The staffs will put sample packs of masks onto the shopping baskets. However, when you make payment at the cashier, they will retrieve the sample packs according to the amount that you spent. I had 4 packs of sample in my basket, and upon check-out, they retrieved 3 as I had purchased 2 lip tints, 25 packs of gel masks. Totally disgusted with their dishonest scheme. And they gave the guts to give me a smirk when I questioned them.By early evening, the food stalls will be out on the streets too. I noticed that certain stalls with no price list listed, are a scam too. At these stalls, prices will go higher if you are a foreigner. Hence, stick to the stalls that have a price list stuck onto the vendor pole.TIP: If you are planning to buy 'expensive' cosmetic brands like Sulwhasoo, Hera, Laneige, best to get at the Duty Free shops at the airport. You will get further discount with your shopping coupons (coupons are available in AREX trains, shuttle bus and even in the tourist map) or Lotte/Shilla VIP card.Moderate labels like Skin Food, Too Cool for School, cheaper off the counter in Myeongdong."
A Must Visit Place in Seoul!,"You must definitely go here in Seoul. It has great little shops, restaurants, and street food stalls. It's bustling with people so prepare to be shoved at times (but that's all over Korea). There's also many places to change money and you usually get a good deal. This is a fun place, enjoy!"
A crazy area for shopping cosmetic,"We stay in Myeongdong area, we are go to shopping in Myeongdong nearly everyday, due to all cosmetic brands are on sales in mid-Jul. to early Aug., the street foods are delicious, I recommend you start to eat street food at 4:00pm and before 9:00pm, it is their business hours."
Shopping & Eating,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a busy street.. place you can find everything..food, cloth, skin care etc. I love this place. Conclusion..Heaven for shopping and eating."
Good for Tourist Sightseeing,Nice to walk down the streets as a tourist - many streetside food stalls offering munchies and tidbits to snack on. Be prepared to see shops of the same few brands every 200m you walk. Retail service staff are not as friendly as expected
Good,A joyful happy bustle around. You can find almost anything under the sun on Myeongdong shopping street.
Crowded and dirty,We stayed near myeongdong shopping street during our 1st trip to Korea. I was surprised to find the dirty streets in Myeongdong. There are many tourists here. The cleaning crew swept and washed the street every day (we saw it since we were up early due to jet lag). But there was trash and dirty by night fall. It got worse when street vendors are out. The sales associates in those skincare stores are like Hawks. We are the prey. They followed you everywhere. It wasn't a pleasant experience for us. 
Make sure you don't miss this place,Myeongdong Shopping Street is the only place to get the coolest stuff in Korea. The metal-work stuff is excellent - You can spend hours here sampling amazing street food and enjoying all the markets.
Good diverse shopping,"Not the marketplace type of shopping, so not a lot of the bartering types of shops. Lots of skincare shops in one area, so that is great. Lots of the local brands and very helpful city employees in the streets that speak all kinds of languages to help you find your way. Also, area is two subway stops from Namdaemun if one also wanted to go to this area. "
STREET FOOD,"Street food heaven! Make Up shopping till you could drop.Lights, people! It comes alive at night so if you are there during the day be sure to stop back at night! And be sure to eat the ice cream with the honeycomb on top!"
Shop for Cosmetics,"Pros1) A LOT of shops where you can find every Korea cosmetic brands, tons of shoes, clothes, and kpop star brochure.. kind of things2) unique ambience where you see more of foreigners than Koreans. You dont have to worry about the language barrier there3) You would love the place if you buy make ups in bulk.Cons1) I feel cheated when buying street food in Myeongdong. It is way too overpriced2) streets are quite dirty as all those Chinese throw away things and as there is certainly lack of trash cans around the street"
Shopping Paradise for the ladies!,"If you are in love with dolling yourself up or just enjoy shopping, Myeongdong Shopping street is a place you CANNOT miss! The whole area is a shopping paradise! I would recommend spending a day or at least 4 - 5 hours here. There are just so many shops. There are many food stalls along the road too. Some of the many things to try are the Rose shaped ice cream and potato tornado!"
Good mix of shops,This area has a good mix of mainstream shops and a lot of interesting smaller boutique type shops. Its worth a visit both at day and night (night being more for eating) and is close to a large local marker
Busy Shopping with Street Food,I like that street and even my family loved it where you will find tones of cosmetic shops and huge variety of street food. The shops open till midnight and it is really safe for night life. 
"Shopping, Eating, Shopping, Eating","A place dotted with many shopping malls, shops and eateries. It can be very crowded during weekends and night time. There is a stall here selling the tallest ice cream cone I have ever seen. Taste of the ice cream - well, so-so. Many cosmetic shops touting for customers. A good place for the youngsters. As for food, I would choose Jungno-gu over Myeongdong. Jungno-gu is more for local and the food is better."
Shipping paradise,"You can buy everything you needed here. Shops offer immediate tax refund with a passport. Most shops have salesperson who can speak Chinese, not English. I went there in during weekday, not crowded. Weather in late Aug is very pleasant too."
Great shopping district but don't get carried away with streetfood,Lots glitz and glamour to be found here. Almost all the cosmetics and skincare products you can think of can be found here...Be warned the streetfood... while tempting.... is very pricey and it's satisfying enough just to share among friends... I had a good bbq meal up above the streets next to Starbucks... It's more value than the streetfood. 
Cosmetics/ Skincare / Food lovers - Must visit,"I went there by myself, NOT with a tour.This is a perfect location for the cosmetics/skincare lovers to shop for their favourate brands such as Tony Moly, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Innisfree, Etude House, Nature Republic, ARITAUM and Olive young etc. Tips: The promoters usually provide free sample to get your attention and most brands provides Get 1 Free 1 promotions. Some promoters emphasized it was the last day of the promotion and tried to convince payment asap but the promotion went on everywhere and I didn't see any difference for the whole week. So just make sure you have a clear mind before making any purchase - it was tempting to have those offers and there was always a better deals with more purchase.Personally I would recommend to visit during the evening with all street stalls out selling amazing popular Korean street food.Tips: Make sure you visit with an empty stomach if you enjoy Korean street food"
Shopping,Awesome place for shopping. Lot of fancy stores and some others cheaper. You would find everything you're looking for
Interesting place ,It is one of interesting places in seoul a lot of traditional food and market with the new shops the best night market 
Full of tourist tat,"In my opinion if you value style make a wide berth of this busy street, possibly good for cosmetic brands"
Shopper's and foodie's dream,"Myeongdong is a modern shopping area. Lots of brands, and less tourist shops. Also there are lots of places to eat and starting afternoon the streets are filled with street food vendors. "
Myeondong street,Different life in Myeondong street with large number of street food caravans with different taste. It is new experience in Korea 
Lots of tourists,"It is a place full of tourists, shopping and searching for food. It's an easy choice if you need to spend some money!"
"Experience Beauty, Food and Chinese ","When in Seoul a trip to Myeondong is must. What do you get? Lots and lots of beauty products stores, fashion stores, interesting street food and yes lots of Chinese tourist with huge bags to pack there beauty products shopping. Between the Chinese you will get to see the beautiful Korean teenagers. I like the buzz and the amazing range of street food presented in interesting way. Korean today is exporters of new food trends to the world and you get to see them first at this area Watch out for a new way of serving ice cream in a cone which looks like a rose flower. "
Cheap cosmetic n clothes,Lovely place to visit for ladies who like makeup...and trendy clothes to buy ..A very busy place too
Place for Shopping,If u go to seoul and want a shopping a branded item or cosmetic. U need to go to this place. It have anyting especially for girl
I like shopping center,"If you buy product made in Korea, of course it's cheap. You can find Korea comestic, Gentle monster sunglass... In there, MCM is still cheaper than some another country. I will back here in near future"
Disappointing experience. Better shopping experience in other parts of Korea.,"The shopping here is messy and honestly not the most value for money if you are not into cheap goods without quality. On top of that, if you don't buy in bulk, most businesses don't entertain you.Much prefer my shopping experience in Busan, or in Gangnam instead."
Good cultural experience,"Good street food and a nice, safe environment. There are good restaurant everywhere if you don't feel like street food."
A must stop for Cosmetics lovers,"Myeongdong is a famous shopping street for Cosmetics. There are many shops of cosmetics which offers duty free items also. Cosmetics of Many brands available. There is an Indian restaurant named ""Taj"" also in this area where we had food after shopping."
MIXED FEELINGS,"Waves and waves of tourist...all the shops looked the same. Repeated shops on different streets and they all sell the same products. Young women & men will stand outside the shops trying to promote their products. It's a skin care heaven shopping place for ladies ! There are many cafes, money changers too. I like the ""food hawker"" selling bbq squids, sweet paste coated fresh strawberries, the famous 32cm long ice cream on a cone. I was told that an average of 1,000,000 person passes through the street of Myeongdong. Not a place for young children or parents with prams. Go and experience the ""walk"" even if there is nothing to buy - join the crowd and have fun !"
Real local loves cuisine ,"Take a break with a smarter choice of food & beverages. A Local beverage store EDIYA Coffee offers seasonal beverages toffee nut latter kwr3,500, grain latter kwr3,500 green tea latte krw3,200. Hot pot rice set only at kwr7,000. "
Relax after work,Good place to visit. A lot of things to buy . Cheap& good. A lot of restaurants for traveller to choose . Good taste and reasonable prices. 
좋아요~,Soooooo many shops on here. Of course you can eat somethings on the street like lemonade or french fries.
street market with lot of local food,street market with lot of local food . you must to try a local food there everything is very tasty . a lot of the restaurants . 
Great place to shop and try some street food.,This place is a cosmetic heaven.You find lots of Korean brands here with lots of good promos and feel free to ask for sample and if you purchase a fair bit ask for some free gifts everyone does it.Other than that you find cute shops from fashion to gadgets. There is something for everyone. Young or old.You have lots of local food stalls all around too but they are not cheap. Things you should try are the fish waffle shaped ice cream with real honeycomb at the top. Rose flower ice cream....and lots more.
Lots of Retail Chains and Fun street shopping,I really liked Myeongdong shopping but it gets SUPER crowded at night. The H&M there is amazing as well as the other chain retain shops like ZARA and XXI. Check out Uniqulo and some of the side streets where you'll find lots of Korean fashions at all price ranges. If you're looking for steals I'd go to the Express Bus Terminal underground instead but Myeongdong is a solid shopping area for pretty much anything you want. The underground market here is good too but more for older than the younger crowd. 
Cosmetics heaven ,"Biggest market of cosmetics I have ever seen. Most of the renown brands are having outlets at this market. So many free gifts, tax free shopping for tourists... what else you want..... Happy shopping... "
Shop til u drop,How I would have loved to shopshopshop the day away. There are many cosmetic shops next to each other. Everything is concentrated so shopping here is easy :)
Shoppinf,"If you're looking for skin products, look no further, this is the place. You can find other products too, like shoes, clothings etc"
Super packed shopping area,"Fun shopping area, this area was my favorite. Had the best night market too for food. However, the food vendors all closed very early since they're just stalls in the street and this wasn't a ""food market""."
Great place to shop and eat,We stayed in the area so it was convenient to pop by every day. Lots of street food at night - although i did not particularly find it very good (Taiwan and Bangkok are better); lots of dining options - the Myeongdong Gyoza eatery lives up to its reputation; love the shopping there - dizzying array of beauty products. 
Korean street food and Korean beauty products!!,"I love hereeee!! We stayed in Myeongdong so that we can shop anytime!!! Also, all of Korean street food is here!! If you are into Korean beauty products, oh man, you will probably spent all your money here!!!!! We went during the Seoul Summer Sale 2016!! So everything is in sale up to 50-70%!! "
Bustling place for shopping and street food,"You will not go hungry here as you will be spoilt for choice with the wide array of Korean food, desserts, restaurants and street food! There's hair salons too but personally I feel that it's at cut throat prices. "
"Do for it girls, this is the reason why you are in Seoul","Bunch of comestic, clothes, foods store, walking there and feel the spirit of korean. I actually love the way they can't speak English and you must work every way to get they understand you for barging or buying something. "
True Seoul experience,Haven for shopaholics with all types of budget. There are many malls and underground wholesale markets. Note that these don't usually open until the evening around 8pm. 
Shop till you drop and eat till you drop too,"Bargain place for cosmetics and clothing . Last week were summer sale period, I got a great offer for korea masks, get many samples given by the sales girl.Go after lunch time. by the time we walked for so many stores and try on different masks, in the evening, time to eat more street foods. Never miss this."
Best place for street food,"You'll never feel bored if you come here for shopping and sample some of the yummiest street snacks. It differs every season.This time I went to Seoul at the end of Spring. Strawberries are abundance, grilled seafood, flaky pastry called taiyaki filled with sweet potato or cream cheese, honey butter corn are some of the favourites. "
Vibrant and lively,"Famous hub in Seoul, somehow you have to go to Myeongdong, for food, for changing money, for shopping. Vibrant, lively, bustling, nothing against the place, but it has never been my favourite spot in Seoul. "
very crowded,Too crowded as it's the most famous tourist shopping area. You can find all Korean and international brands (medium level) plus on the weekend the famous Korean street food. I suggest to visit in the morning (they normally open the shops between 10 and 10.30).
Was better before the tourist explosion,"Have beem living in Korea for over 5 years, and I must say that each year 명동 becomes less and less enjoyable.It is sooo crowded, and with a seemingly never ending influx of tourists it doesn't look like that will end anytime soon.My advice is you can find all of the same stores at almost any major subway stop in Seoul, and you can shop much more comfortably."
Crazy shopping,"Shopping at its best. I love this shopping street, all the latest fashion, trendy, cool and hip styles line the shops of these streets. Hundreds of Korean make up and skin care brands to choose from. Late in the afternoon, kiosks of food stalls line the middle of the shopping streets for a taste of Korean snacks. "
Big city,"When we went out for our first time touring the city, this was highly recommended. The walking areas, the people,and shopping are second to none. We had a great time."
Shopping paradise,"Best place to go shopping in Seoul. We were after some Korean beauty products and found some great offers, don't hesitate to haggle to get freebies."
fantastic shopping and street food alley!,"Once you arrive there, you might be so suprized at so many people walking along the street filled with so many street venders and shops! But it's really exciting to walk around there, finding, tasting and shopping there! Street food was really good and our tour guide let us know good restaurants,too! It turns out so great! For food, shopping and real korean modern culture, I recommend to look around this alley! highly!!!!!!!!"
Shoppers and Foodies Paradise,"You are spoilt by having so many different types of shopping in Myeongdong. Besides clothing, shoes, make-up shops , department stores etc there are also the interesting stalls of freshly cooked food in the middle of the closed streets. It is a shoppers and foodies paradise."
Yummy street food,"I'm in love with this street , you can go and have ice-cream , sandwich , smoothie and more as a snack , also you ganna enjoy shopping for things that made in Korea."
Cosmetics Heaven,"We stay in Myeongdong area. It is a cosmetics heaven! Almost all korean brands available there. You can also enjoy street food along the street and back to shop again. Many good restaurants in Myeongdong, such as: Myeongdong Kyoja, Yoogane, etc. Down the street, you can also find beautiful Catholic Church."
affordable cosmetics,there were a lot of cosmetic to choose from and also money changer available most every corner. i think buying cosmetic here is better they give a lot of freebees. mostly mask pack. depends on your purchase sometime it comes with lipstick. so many options. they also have all those nice contact lenses that makes your eyes look big. dont forget to ask for travel receipt to get a travel refund when you go back to the airport.
Great for solo travellers!,"Whether you are travelling alone, with friends or family, Myeongdong is a great place to go and walk around. You get loads of street food and uncountable shops to walk in. If you feel lonely when you travel alone, come here!! Or if you are with someone, come here to double. the shopping fun! The only thing is it's crowded almost all the time and the price is more expensive compared to shops in Hongdae and Ewha. "
Popular shopping area in Seoul,"I think no one will miss to visit this famous shopping area in Seoul. You can find numerous shops and restaurant here. If you are do crazy shopping in clothings and cosmetics, this is definitely a place you need to go. Also, you can find lots of restaurants selling traditional Korea food. In conclusion, an area to spend whole day long!"
Sadly overrun by Chinese tourists,"Mainland China has helped Korea's economy significantly, especially via the tourism sector. But it comes with a price. Terrible mannered Chinese tourists that have little regard for local customs or even international standards for mutual respect. Myeongdong is overrun by them; so much that even local sales people greet you in Chinese and can speak nearly fluently in Mandarin. From the public display of spitting, loud and aggressive talking, pushing, cutting in lines, tour group leaders with their announcers, and the rampant use of selfie sticks, Myeongdong was not very impressive. Rather, it felt like I was in mainland China. Aside from the people, the food was also mediocre. What I thought would be stall after stall of different, delicious and unique cuisines, I was disappointed to discover that there were about 5-8 stalls that were cloned and placed on all streets in the Myeongdong area, giving the perception that the area was a foodie haven where instead it felt like Starbucks placed on each street for maximum coverage. The food was not ""amazing"" and nothing unique that you can't find in other cities or countries for that matter. You can skip this destination if you're only considering the food; else, the shopping is fairly decent."
Cosmetic and skin care paradise!,"There are just so many stores here on skin care products - it's easy to get lost around here! But the atmosphere is great - lots of shopping (not only for skin care, but also clothes!), street food and young people. Definitely worth a visit, if not more than once! "
Expensive but fun,"Its a lot of fun to get to see the koreans cooking, all the stores and the nightlife but for shopping might not be the best place. Aside from forever 21, stores here are really expensive. "
Busy shopping streets with great foods,"i really enjoyed walking through different streets with huge shopping variation.The streetfood is excellent too, tobokki in myeongdong is also worth trying!"
Street food - DO IT DO IT DO IT,Just went there for the street food (twice) Korean food that tastes amazing! Very busy and there are a lot of shops around.
Shopping,It's very crowded lots of shops though they pretty much selling the same stuff. Important to remember not to eat at any of the local restaurants without asking for the actual pricing. We were shocked when we were charged almost us$250 for a three course meals for 2 at a bbq restaurant. Menu stated price apparently is for per person as what we were told. 2 beef slices cost us $150 can u believe e it? We tried another restaurant n asked for the price which was confirmed while ordering. When settling bill we were again charged double and you can argue till the vow comes home but still landed paying it.
MUST GO,"It is so much fun to walk around. The streets are crowded. It has its own unique style. Cosmetic shops everywhere, food carts everywhere and it's delicious. Just go there and enjoy yourself."
Fun and food,"Stopped by on several occasions to sample the food and never left dissatisfied. While it can be quite crowded, it is well worth the visit. You can find some incredible snacks, full sit down restaurants, and small shops and street vendors. If you go, you must try the grilled snail, it's excellent."
Lively,This is much a district than a shopping street. Full of Korean cosmetics stores and you can try some street food there. it is very crowded at night but in a good way
Beauty Make Up Shopping,if you look for all related to make up and beauty.. this is the place that can satisfy you.. It's a girl place with lot's of Korean make up brand.. They also have a night snacks market in the center of the walking path and you can find some interesting food. Good but not too good..
Great value shopping and street food,Went there at night and full of buzz with street food vendors and shopping along with the small outlets and restaurants. Loved the atmosphere!
Go there,Just go and enjoy. Taste the different food they offer. Cheap and delicious. Buy some body lotions or tea or just hung arround. 
Unique district focused on cosmetics,"If you are looking for Korean cosmetics, this the place. But it is a popular spot all day and evening with restaurants and other stores. "
Delicious Food,"It was pretty fun to just walk around the neighborhood. There is a lot to see, a lot of shops, cafes and street food wagons. They serve a diverse variety of food and its absoluteli delicious. Just 2 things we bought for a quick snack."
"Very lively, street face and shops.. thats it","Its very lively up to 22:00, there is abundant street food vendors and shops. You can stroll down and enjoy your juice or snack, its safe and well accessed. Give it a go"
"Really like Taiwan's night market, but during day!","It is just like what the title above said. There are street vendors selling delicious food and drinks. There are also cosmetic, clothes, shoes shops left and right beside the streets. Overall, it is a great place to go for shopping since it literally has everything there. If you want a perfect picture of how the place feels like, it is like Taipei's Ximending.P.S. Didn't have time to take picture since there were so many people around, and I was quite busy carrying shopping bags on one hand, and food on the other."
Street Food Good,We had some street food there which was good but I think you could get some less expensive food at the underground shopping malls or in subways.
Go for the food not the shopping!!,ok - its a shopping area but to be honest it came alive for me at night when all the street food traders came out. There was such a huge choice it was hard to resist!! The usual European and American brands are here but try and find the beauty shops as beauty in Seoul is HUGE and some home grown brands that are great e.g. Nature Republic stores. 
"Fun for Food, Strolling, Window Shopping",A few decent shops but overall a bit pricey for goods. Great place to get a feel for modern Korea. And for Korean watching. See the latest fashions and hear KPop being played in the street from shops. Many restaurants and cafes. Eclectic. Vendors with mid street carts are fun to peruse and often have the best bargains on accessories and trinkets.
Couldn't get enough,Love love the place if you are a shopaholic like me. The street food is to die for. Never give this a miss!
Will come back one day,"I love Korea and I love the buzz and atmosphere in Myeongdong. All alive & fun. As expected in Korea.You can literally find anything here, from food, cheap shopping, skincare, accessories, and etc.Travelled July 2015"
Not enough for One day.,"Are u ready for Shopping?? if yes, please set your time as least 2 days for shopping at Myeongdong Shopping Street, this place is so many cosmetics shop, cloths & shoes."
 Night myongdong visit,Myongdong street is the most crowded people area in Seoul for shopping and food kiosko experience.I visited with my family after years and I recommend night visit for best flavour of amazing shopping and street food experience
Great shopping area but not if you're a budget tourist,"Great shopping area. It's like shopping in 5th avenue or Paris, in other words expensive!! You can window shop, not for budget tourist."
Great crowded place for all to shop and munch on snacks,"The place to be to shop for female products , tons of free samples (please ask for more ) , money worth to spend place as it's inexpensive and duty free as well. Many local Korean street food is available too. Majority of shop staff, food stall staff and the people around speak fluent Korean and Mandarin languages. English speaking is available but limited .The stall close beyond 10pm most of it."
Best shopping in Seoul,Best street to shop and eat in all Seoul. Tons of street shops for food and souvenirs. Restaurants and lotion stores everywhere. Nights light up the street with more markets and food (specially on weekends). Do not miss it!
Meh,"Depending on what time of day you go there and also what weekday you may encounter normally crowded streets to very very busy streets. Before the shops are people trying to get you to come inside the shops and give you masks as a treat, especially on the weekend. Honestly nothing bothered me there and I knew the place was good to get CDs for a good price. It is after all a shopping street and as such one should see it. The shop assistants are good with English, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Was a fun place to stroll around and just explore."
Shoppers Paradise,A place for tourists to shop. It mainly specialises in Beauty products but they also cater to fashion. It ranges from cheap to luxury goods (no to much on luxury for road side stalls) and has nearby malls like lotte plaza and lotte young. Also offers a variety of food and is accessible to lots of tourist spots.
Shopping paradise,"Of all the areas I went to in Seoul, Myeongdong was ourabsolute favorite. The streets were just lined with so many shops and good restaurants."
Place to shop,This was the place for the younger members in our group. Spend a good number of hours and could see the place change as night near. 
Shoppers paradise,"Great place to soak in the shopaholic scene in Seoul, with innumerable stores for range of products from international vs korean house. The vibrant place with street food options is a must do especially if one is looking for great deals on local cosmetic brands"
Shop till you drop!,"Myeongdong is a heaven for girls. There are a lot of cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Banilla, Aritaum, Clio and more. Around 4pm, street food vendors will start their business at there. "
Ming Dong Guesthouse,Ming Dong Guesthouse's envoirnment is quite good. We reserve twin bed and the bed is large and it is very comfortable.
COSMETICS!!!!,"Like seriously any Korean cosmetic brand you could think of is here. Saw 5 of the same brand littered about the stretch. The staff barely spoke English but were very eager to help. Requesting for tax free when you forget and come back later is like asking for an arm and a leg. So basically gotta remember that anything above 40,000₩ entitles you to tax free which you HAVE TO ASK FOR. And don't forget to bring your passport because trust me; you'll go mad here and you'll definitely be entitled to tax after. Prices in Singapore are fluctuated to 200% so trust me I'm not exaggerating on the level of madness. Men, just drop your women here and pick them up after the stores shut. Oh yes. There are cat and dog cafes here where you could come by for their meat. KIDDING. Entry's about 8,000₩ and you get a drink and you can play with the resident cats and dogs or catch up with friends while having these animals coming up to you for a pet."
The variety of street food is unbelievable!,"Come at night! Beside all the different shops along the street, you can sample different variety of street foods in one place. Come hungry and you will be satisfied. Not to be missed when visiting Seoul."
Overwhelming Make-up Shopping,"While this area included some unique eating experiences (mochi covered strawberries, super tall ice cream cones, spiral potatoes, and more!), it was mostly an area dedicated to skin care and makeup for woman. Many of the stores repeat themselves on every block. Unless you are in search of skincare products, this busy street may not be worth visiting."
Your hearty supply of beauty needs!,"This is the first place we went to straight from the airport. The whole street is packed with beauty skin care and cosmetics. And mostly they have promos for bulk items which is good for gifts. You can also score cheap accessories like bags, etc."
"Crazy shopping area, a must!","Myeongdong shopping street is a very exciting place. Cheap Korean cosmetic shops are everywhere, they are not only cute but also very good products for teeanagers. This is an absolutely place to visit. "
Shopping!,"Nice area filled with many shops and eateries, including street vendors selling many things and food. A lot of beauty products and sunglasses sold here. Seemed safe and tourist friendly."
Great for skin care products,"Its a great place to visit and spend hours there . You can go inside many shops and get free samples inly for rntering , i collected about 20 free face masks . It was amazing !!Its also great for walking and to eat some street food . You can also find some nice cafes like the dogs cafe , cats cafe were you go and spend time with dogs or cats .Also there is the hello kitty cafe . Well i recomend ti visit and spendat lest 1 hour"
Go for the street food if shopping,"This place is packed with shoppers mostly buying cosmetics, go for the street food if not for shopping. Easily accessible by subway. Most Koreans stay away from this street and almost 90% of the people you see will be Chinese tourists lugging big bags full of cosmetics "
Beauty... Food... Fashion...,"It's incredibly busy, but worth it.Street food stalls assault your senses!Every other shop is fashion or beauty!This is the Korean capitalism heart if you're on a High Street budget.Have cash in your pocket and unlike any other countries, here you're heckled by beauty store sales people who want your business, rather than restaurant staff haha!Honestly, I feel this place is about food and beauty.I love Innesfree for beauty/skincare, so made a bee-line and spent 45 minutes making my choices - good to know for purchases totalling over 30,000w they offer on the spot tax refund but you must have your passport with you, otherwise be sure to present the receipt at the airport. Helpfully, there was a laminated sign on the counter that told you what your tax refund would be... Check out my photos!I love any street food vendors, but note it's worth getting there about 7-7.30 for the real buzz and you're best to walk through and browse before buying so you know what's on offer - usually: soft shell crab tempura, egg bread, meatballs, gorgeous filled cheesy mini omelette cakes (you MUST try one!) various noodle, spicy chicken, savoury pancakes, octopus/seafood and there's even a stall we got abalone! Yum! Lots of juice stalls too... We stuck with orange juice, but would also advise on taking a bottle of water with you. Once you've bought food, etiquette seems to be you move to the side of the stall, stand and eat. Then stick your trash in the nearest bin and move on. Simple and common sense.We didn't really pay attention to the fashion retailers other than Uniqlo and TopTen both of which offered great T-shirts and about £5 a piece... Bargain!All in all, well worth a wander... and if you're more into malls, Lotte has it covered just the other side of the road with Young Plaza, plus the high end luxury goods mall including Chanel etc. Something for everyone in this neighbourhood!"
Best place to buy cosmetics,"Myeongdong is a must place to visit when you come to Seoul, cause you'll find any kind of facial products here. Plus the thing that makes me always want to visit this place again and again is the street food that open in the evening."
lots of individual shops,Its easy to get to this shopping area on the metroWe weren’t very impressed by the range or the prices. We understood that Seoul shopping is amongst the bestI have found better quality at lower prices in other parts of SeAsia but the experience and foot weary expedition provided an interesting afternoon
Best place to get your high-fashion Korean fix.,"Lots of shiny shops lining the streets, plenty of snacks, great fashion, and even really fun to go during the middle of the winter. It is not as inexpensive as going to the open air markets, but still very fun. Great place to get clothing & makeup. And also to people watch. "
Great place to people watch and get a feel of the city,Enjoyed exploring the streets with local street food aplenty. Interesting to see a mix of street vendors and permanent shops' assistants vying for attention and selling their wares. 
Fantastic - Not to be missed,"The title says it all. Vibrant. Energetic. Fun. Food. Cosmetics.It gets even busier with stalls opening at around 4pm. By 6pm, the whole place was bustling with people. Cheap eats. Good shopping. What other combinations that are better than that?"
Korea skin care galore!,"This is the place where you will find every Korean skin care brand shops like Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Laneige, Faceshop, TonyMoly, Too Cool for School, etc. Go to All Mask Story for the best selection of face masks. Prices seem competitive among the stores. You should negotiate for free samples & pick the stores that offer instant tax refunds. "
Too many people,Too many tourists from a certain country. Very chaotic and noisy and people shouting from all over the place. Not a pleasant place but this place has all the korean skincare and cosmetic stores you can think of and more
Little China!,"Don't be fooled by the sales girls, or boys, I would say 70% of them were from China as they happened to speak Korean as their mother tongue too! Already the Koreans are not that attentive, this PRC bunch is making things worse!They are in retail but their rude unfriendly and unhelpful attitude pissed me off and I totally hated this area!This is also a place where tourists get scammed easily, so be warned!You may just stroll, and ignore those screaming sales staffs, or even just be rude back as being nice in Seoul is literally pointless!"
Best shopping expereince,"Though the streets were packed with shoppers, it was still clean and orderly. Endless stores of beauty products at affordable prices. We also enjoyed the street food that were offered in the afternoon."
You can get everything and taste fantastic foods,"You can just walk around and taste the fantastic and typical foods around. Or you can get to a restaurant, or you can just go shopping. A very nice place to walk around."
Tourist place,"It is a cosmetic heaven. Every street is lined with cosmetic and beauty shops and they keep repeating. However, I feel that these cosmetic brands can be found everywhere in Korea, and the stores outside of Myeongdong have better deals??? (More freebies) Also, the street food is more expensive comparatively."
Good place to get face masks or street food,Streets lined with shops - mainly beauty shops where you can buy face masks including snail mucus masks! Food stalls selling all kinds of food. Interesting experience in the evening
The place you can not missed,"Myeongdong is my favourite place in seoul. It is good place to walk, eat, shopping and try some snack along the street. When i am visited in july it is summer time sale so it is really exciting. If you go to seoul do not missed to visit myeongdong and have a great time there."
Nice place to shop for cosmetics ,"It is quite happening when the night falls and there are lots of street food to try. You can definitely shop your cosmetics products here at reasonable price and remember to ask for tax refund! However, the street foods are quite pricey. There are a few decent restaurants here as well which you can try."
Not my kind of shopping,It just showed how Korean loves their cosmetic and skincare products. We visited on a rainy day maybe a reason why we didn't find much food stalls. For people looking for K-Pop souvenirs it's best to go to the Kpop Music Store on the 3rd Floor of Nature Republic. They sell albums and K-drama stuff too.
"Cosmetics, cosmetics, cosmetic",This is simply paradise for someone who likes cosmetics there are 33 different brands of cosmetics stores in the vicinity. Go to Innisfree it is an awesome store.
Shopping Haven,"Shopping, shopping and lotsa shopping. This is the best shopping area in Seoul. Cosmetics, apparels, foods are everywhere.We stayed at Jongo which is only about 10mins walk to Myeongdong.This area is quite big and no worries if youre kinda lost as you can always ask around and signage are everywhere."
Crowded and noisy,Huge crowds and very touristy. But a good place to get your cosmetics and skincare products. Also lots of trendy chain cafes.
Fantastic place to try street food and shop - but beware of the crowds,"A good place to check out for a few hours; there's shopping, street food and many restaurants to keep you occupied. Be sure to map out where you are going as it can get a bit confusing especially when it's crowded. The place is huge! Keep in mind that many of the BBQ places in this area are a bit overpriced so do your research before walking in."
Shopping street,"No doubt a shopping street however very repetitive. The same cosmetics brand shops keep turns up after a with mins, they all try to get you into their shop. There are also many food stalls for a snack."
A lot of stores,"As the titles says, there is a very lot of stores here, but since this is a shopping street it's only expected. The price here is similar to the ones in Hongdae, meaning; not very cheap. I'd say it similar to European prices or American ones.But the streets are always bustling and full of life and a few stores you only find there so it's worth visiting."
Never boring,"How many times I visited korea, myeongdong is the best place to do everything. Shopping, eat, dating, etc. the location also easy to find and u just need to get here by subway( my hotel in seocho ). And when evening this place starting more crowded and full with the tourist also the Korean. I really like to shopping in Zara and uniqlo. The store has a big store and easy to find in here. And for cosmetic shopping myeongdong is a heaven for u. Every kind of Korean brand in here and the must go place in korea is 명동 "
Good day or night,"This is the place to go if you want to get your dose of shopping and Korean cosmetics, as you will have 3-4 of the same beauty brands with stores barely 50m apart from each other. If you can't find one thing you're after just try the other store down the street. It's good to come with a target list of things you hope to buy. No matter what you will end up with tonnes of samples. There is also a cute dog cafe you can visit."
very crowded site,the street is very crowded.most Chinese visit the street and buy something.but Koreans is where a short visit.
Busy streets,"It is a good place for shopping. This place is huge. We're aimlessly wonder around and got lost several times. Haha. Despite there are many similar shops with same brand, some shops do have different promotion. Beware when you take the so-called-free-gift (normally is face mask), they will pull you to their shop. It is good if you're intend to purchase anything. But if no, put your hands off . Some shops do offer immediate tax refunds, otherwise they will advise you to refund it at airport (which is easy and fast too)"
Korea Cosmetic Heaven,This area full with all famous korean brand cosmetic. the price also quite affordable and a good place have a lots of bargain. Really love this place. What more I love this place they gaves us a lots of free samples. Yeah!! we can used for travel purpose..
The place everyone visits in Seoul,"You have to see it to believe it... The prices for goods are not that great, and there are much better placed to shop in Seoul. But this is the tourist trap of Seoul. Go look...just don't buy..."
Great night scene,The fun starts after dark when the street vendors come out with the various food carts. We found one with soft-shell crab. What a treat for our last night in Seoul
Great night market,"During the day, its very crowded and lots of different cosmetic shops with people trying to pull you in to buy stuff. On the plus side, they give you free masks if you buy something. The strange thing here is that there a multiple branches of the same shop only a few doors away from each other. This street is a shopping Mecca for those looking for cosmetics. The night market is the best here. Great atmosphere with lots of street food and the main street shops also stay open very late."
Amazing Street !,"What to say more as the other reviews that shopping street is amazing for the number of shops, especially for the cosmetic products and if you are not a fan of that. You will be a fan of the little food places along that street ;-)So go there and enjoy !"
Girls must visit,"it's shopping street has all fashion close and cosmetics, skin care and of course food. massive area and ppl everywhere. "
Cool shopping place. ,"You must go to Line and friend shop if you are their fan. There are a huge Brown for you to take photo with. Lot if gifts to buy an d food to try. There are lot of skincare shops. But I recommend to buy them near any metro stations as you can get a tax refund straight away if buying more than 30,000 won n showing ur passport. "
Cheap Cheap,This place is so so happening! and i the cosmetic items is very cheap and dont worry about the language barrier. Just enjoy!
There so much to see that it made dizzy.,"Pretty much an outdoor mall with lots of street vendors and lots of options to dine, and shop. What I liked the best was the fresh fruit cut and ready to consume also baked sweet potatoes, yummy."
Cosmetics and street food,"If you're fond of cosmetics or want to try street foods, myeongdong's for you! For the ladies, go to every cosmetics store and gets lots of free things (korean call this service!). Don't buy at the first shop you see though. Look at others first before buying. Wear comfortable shoes as you'll be walking a lot. "
Branded shops,A shopping street carrying many known brands such as Nike Adidas Superga Art box etc etc and the prices are the usual retail price. Pretty crowded but nothing very special. 
we can easily walk to myeongdong,"During the trip, we can easily walk to myeongdong from the hotel which close to myeongdong about 2 km with good weather"
Crowd and more crowd,"As soon as you get out of the train station there goes the shopping street gallore, price aren't cheap as we all hoped but we just tour as much as we can... Food stalls everywhere and they're pretty delicious... The trick is if you're on a budget don't go inside those boutiques (unless you have specific target purchase) instead keep your eye on the stalls outside the boutiques k name brands store... Plenty of well made clothing merchandise and shoes...this place is not for people that doesn't like crowd because this place is jampacked with all sorts of people☺️☺️"
Outdoor Mall,"Busy shopping district - lots of options for dining, entertainment, shopping (multiple stores of the same name around every corner make this a bit of a maze to get lost in...)"
NIght Shopping need I sy more!,Awesome experienceWhenever I have visitors this is on our to do list It is always jammed pack The locals love to bargainGood street food Easy to get dropped off and picked up by taxi 
Great place for make up lovers!,"i love this place so much. It's the must visit place for you who love fashion. Along the street is a make up and branded-fashion shop. You can get a good price here especially for Korean make up, and you can get a free sample :)) how great is it!"
Great place to spend all your money on cosmetics,This is a cosmetic heaven! Love every inch of the street. Try the street food. You can buy souvenirs too. 
Happening Place to be~!!,"I loved walking down the streets of Myeongdong! It had all sorts of wonderful eateries, every few feet! Get home made drinks squeezed fresh from every fruit (grapefruit, lemon, pomegranite, orange, pineapple, etc...) to all sorts of yummmy concoctions: flame fired squid, dumplings, korean pancakes, fish cake soup, 3 feet high ice cream cones, etc.... too much fun! AND there's great shopping to add to the wonderful food festival!!"
fashionable,"Even if you don't like Korean fashion this is a place to be, especially during weekend. Free samples everywhere, I would recommend Korean cosmetics, it's not expensive and it is great."
Great Shopping Street,"I went here with my family and the atmosphere on this street is amazing. During the evening, tons of food carts will be selling street food and people will be bustling around. I think this is a good way of experiencing Korean street food.The downside about this street are: over priced street food, lots of carts selling similar food, and the shops along the street is also quite repetitive (you can find 2 - 3 same cosmetics shop in the same street)"
Great shopping,Great shopping for both genders with mostly shops selling cosmetics.Street food is awesome but a tad too expensive.
A place must go!,"Vary kind of goods (clothes, cosmetic, street food, etc.) to enjoy. Prepare yourself a good shoes for walking several hours each time coming here ;)"
All day shopping and eating,"Spent few days in Seoul last week and stayed at Myeongdong. Right in front of the busy shopping street. You can spent the whole day here without going to other places.This shopping area have several streets with lots of shops (mostly cosmetics, but also shoes, sport wear ), numerous restaurants of korean restaurants, also with japanese and desserts, etc. You must try the foods from hawkers selling all types of local snacks. You will be full if you pick one from each of them. They are tasty. But they only starts from afternoon around 2-3pm. So spend you day in the shop in the morning and stay on the street afterwards."
shopping heaven for cosmetics lover,"very tourist-y area. so food stall around here is expensive compare to other part of seoul. example roasted cheese clam, 8000w here, 4-3000w elsewherebut you're not here for the food (or clothes). myeongdong is cosmetic shopping mecca!! shop staff will lure you with free sample or even free face mask. most of them can speak chinese even more fluent than me. no english or broken korean is needed here"
I am not a shopper - but cool to people watch and eat street food!,"As the title says, there are so many stores in this area but I am not a big shopper so that did not interest me as much as people watching. The street food was cool to look at and eat! I tried some fried squid on a stick and loved it (and did not get sick as people warned me I might)."
Great fun ,Wandering through this food cart filled street was a highlight of Seoul. There is entertainment along the way and the food is just delicious. Go out of your way to get here!
Disappointing,"This is a narrow shopping street with lots of vendors crammed in. The product quality is very low. The was a wide range of items - food, clothing, electronics etc"
A buzzing beehive: food and shops,"Myeongdong is definitely worth a try, especially for the variety of food (often intriguing for one who's not used of Asian street food), the shops (lots of cosmetics, and the very trendy snail face cream), coffee shops and restaurants. It's a good immersion, which is going to request your every seconds of attention! A nice, but intense, experience!"
Has almost everything that you'll need,"Myeongdong is Korea's ultimate shopping destination. Whatever you are looking for, chances are, you'll find it in Myeongdong. It helps that the streets are compact, you do not have to do much walking to get around. Korean cosmetics brands - Nature Republic, Innisfree, Etude House, The Face Shop, etc. all have multiple stores here and they give out free samples to entice you in. The Migliore in Myeongdong (below Loisir Hotel) has even better prices than the Migliore in Dongdaemun.Myeongdong is also where you can get the best rates from money changers. We changed money a few times here and were satisfied with the rates we got. We found that those on the second floor usually give better rates. There are also reputable eateries here like Myeongdong Kyoja. The range of the Artbox here is not as good as the ones in Hongdae or Edae, so I would not recommend shopping at the branch here.The Lotte Young Plaza and Lotte Mart are also nearby. In the afternoon, street stalls se up and sell their wares. Namsan and N Seoul Tower is also within walking distance, if you want to take a break from the bustle of all the shopping. If you are staying in the area, I suggest choosing a place right in the middle of the shopping streets and not on the side of Pacific Hotel/Hotel Prince, to be closer to the action."
It's all about you!,"Everything you could possibly need is here clothes, food, toiletries, gifts, socks etc. No household wear or electronics though. Closes about ten p.m. Easy to navigate around. Ate some really good food."
favourite place for tourist,"there are a lot of street food in this area, which we we can enjoy it while shopping, for mosle dont worry because there are also halal food, the price is fair enough."
Worth Visiting,"for anyone whom is into Korean skincare, this is THE place to go. Would have given 5 stars if there are more variety as you do get a lot of repeated brand even on the same street."
Korea's Beauty Street,"If you love Korean makeup and beauty care, this is the place for you. A wide selection of Korean home brands (more than 1 shop for a particular brand in a row). Often with a lot of discounts. They even throw in a lot of free samples of you purchase couple of items. If they don't, try asking them for free samples."
For the Discerning Shopper,"Another spot for tourists to seoul to do their shopping. Main street and the parallel streets full of shops with the latest fashions and trends in all clothing, footwear, electronics, etc Also food stalls and restaurants"
Very different mornings to the afternoons,"Always busy but much more so after 4pmAt that time the street vendors appear in their droves and transform the roads into tiny passageways that very quickly fill with people. If you like that sort of thing then great, if you do not then you still have to see it!!!"
Shopping street for ignorance foreigners,"I noticed there were a lot of visited foreigners and very few locals shopped and bought their staffs there. The street food price tag is more expensive, for e.g. a fruit juice cost me only W2,000 when I bought it near my Hotel, but it costs W4,000 from this street.I managed to find a few very small food stalls located at the back lane of the street, which offered excellent taste and good price local food.Tip: follow the locals and do not choose a restaurant full of foreigners."
Great shopping experience,"This street has everything you need! Esp if you're looking for Korean cosmetics! They have every brand here and what's good is that the stores are very competitive esp during weekends. Watch out for promotions or freebies during weekends. I failed to buy the weekend I was there and when I went back on a Monday, the promotions the previous weekend weren't available anymore.Also, check out the food kiosks! Lots of interesting and unique food to try. Great shopping and foodie experience!"
shop till you drop,Too fun!! too much to see!! Lots of goodies. Great to get the souvenirs. Prices are decent and a lot of variety to chose from.
Great for Shopping and Food,Many shops and eateries good varieties. Best time to visit is from late afternoon to night. That's when all the street food and merchandise vendors are also ready for business. 
Great street shopping!,"It's a great area to shop for cosmetics - so many deals on makeup and skincare (especially face masks)!!! Makes for great gifts to bring back home. Lots of street food, bars, clothes, shoes shops etc too. My favorite on this street was the Cat cafe! There is a dog cafe too. I love dogs, but didn't go to the dog cafe as I felt it'd be harder to get out of it lol"
if you like shopping and street food go here,It's amayzing how many shops are there and the time they are open. in the evening there is street food for every ones choise. it's a visit worth
Good for the experience but that's about it,"Personally I feel that this place is overrated because with regards to shopping, there are too many repeat shops - especially Korean cosmetics. A great place to buy cheap face treatment masks. The whole experience of being in a bustling and crowded shopping street in Seoul is a must when in Korea. There are many eateries to be tried - on the streets as well as restaurants. Given so many other places to see in Seoul, I would just do this once. While there, do drop in Ossulloc, a green tea cafe selling their famous green tea spread."
Shop till you drop,"If shopping is your this, Myeongdong Shopping Street is the place to be. Lots of different stores, always a night market and great food."
Myeongdong Corner,"Night time after dinner, walk around for window shopping. Right at the corner, there is a ice cream seller. If you female, plus nice looking. Be ware of the guy selling ice cream. Umm...."
Great food & Shopping,My son & I explored the market & really enjoyed seeing all the food stalls & great shops. Very interesting.
A must for shoppers and foodies,"Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived at Myeondong at around 6:30 pm. Just in time for the street food vendors to start selling their gastronomic creations. Moving from stall to stall and sampling food from grilled scallops topped with melted cheese to the barbecued steak and bulgogi was just wonderful. The food was also relatively cheap (between KW2000-KW8000 per order or $1.75-$7/ order). The money changer in Myeondong (the one next to the subway exit across the street from Lotte Young) , in my experience, had the best conversion rates. I will definitely be going back to this place when I visit Korea again."
Everything and anything you want...,"Take the MyeongDong exit and open your world to this busy but fun shopping zone.This is the perfect place to go shop for make-up and clothes. Albeit it's a bit more expensive than the underground markets nearby, it's pretty decent and a good one-stop shop. It gets rather lively in the evening with food carts lining the main streets with yummy fried and spicy foods galore. You can also find vendors along the streets selling everything from clothes, hairpins, and purses for unbelievable prices. Even if you're not there to shop, it's fun just strolling down the street window shopping or stopping by one of the many restaurants to grab a drink. TIP: remember to shop around. You'll be seeing the SAME things in many stores and you might find something up to 10 wons cheaper somewhere else down the street! "
Great for shoppers,"The street is full of stores, especially cosmetics and clothes. The place was crowded but still great to visit. All the lights are cool at night so worth to visit even for that."
Has everything that a tourist want,"A shopping haven for ladies! You have shops giving free masks to lure you into the shop. Be careful as they are very good sales people and you might end up buying more than you bargained for. It was a nice shopping experience even if you just want to window shop. There's a lot of street food at night, starting about 3pm. The restaurants however, food, not so lovely. Almost double the price from elsewhere in Seoul, it also doesn't taste as good. Very tourisy restaurants. I would suggest go shopping here, go somewhere else for food."
A must visit for tourists,"Myeongdong is a busy shopping area that's full of people all day. Particularly, it's a convenient place for tourists whose looking for cosmetic shops, local clothes, restaurants, department stores, money exchange shops, etc."
Must Love Shopping,"First you must love makeup. Every street level shop is a beauty shop, every block repeats the same store. I saw 5 store fronts of the same store in a 5 block walk. All the clothing stores are rising on the second floor or higher. My niece visited several shops and did have difficulty communicating as no one really spoke English. We ended up spending some time in a great cat café waiting out the rain. If you love to shop this is the hippest street. If you don't peek in and then run."
Grwtbgun,Not huge variety just great bustle of people and enough to keep you interested and entertained. Lost the kids a few times but since it's really one street with offshoots was OK 
The dinner time zoo is something to witness,"The street vendors are spectacular: every food imaginable, and just crowd watching is 'worth the detour'. To say ""this is where it is all happening"" would underestimate this amazing display of enterprise and energy."
Enjoy your windows shopping & EAT,Very nice street to windows shopping & enjoy street foods.Topoki for 3000 KRW & Dumpling 1000KRW very delicious and lots of other street foodVery recommended..!!! 
Good positive lovely vibes! <3,I love Myeongdong Shopping Street. It's very lively and full of street foods and shops! There's also a cat cafe and all sort of things that are suitable for teenagers also for the adults.
A heaven for shoppers and food lovers,"Lots and lots of cosmetic shops especially, and there a lot of eateries as well. There's even a cat cafe in Myeongdong. The street food are delecious and surely not to be missed. There are volunteers in red clothes can be found in the centre of Myeongdong that will provide you maps and detail explanations on what to do and where to go in Myeongdong. They speak English very well."
Fun shopping and lots of street food!,"I really like walking around Myeongdong! It's fun to shop during the day when it's less crowded. My fave buys here are cosmetics, skin care, and shoes. Before sunset, the street vendors will arrive so the street will be more crowded. Try the street food! There's plenty to choose from and they're delicious! There's one vendor we've been going back to since last year. An old lady who sells tteokboki, odeng, mandu, and boiled snail. Her spot varies but last spring, she was in front of uniqlo, beside Nature Republic by the station exit. Her tteokboki's the best. You can tell it's homemade. Aside from that, this place is also filled with restaurants and cafes where you can rest after shopping. Try Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory! It's delicious. Better that Two Two, IMO. Look up, it's at a higher level."
Lots of shops and street food,"We went there and stopped by a cat cafe for a drink and kids to play with the cats. After a rest, we walked around the street and there were lots of beauty shops with some ladies standing in front of the shops to promote their products. There are a lot of street food to choose from and ice cream stalls too. If you like to shop for Korean skincare and cosmetic, you can come and look for them here."
Good for dinner and walk around,"Good for some dinner and walk arounf see people w friends, korean called it chinese town because so many chinese tourists here, the price very high as well."
Great at night.,Great atmosphere. Lots of shops and many street food options. It's easy to access by subway. There are so many people so take care.
"Our all time favourite, went there 4 times in a week!","The most shopper friendly shopping street with food and shops at every corner. It was rather easy navigating the streets too unlike other districts where you feel like you are going round in circles or there is nothing much to do. Plenty of food push carts along the way too. They have a 3 level Nature Republic and Olive Young, a good place to get your seaweed snacks also. On top of that you can get a clear view of the Seoul Tower. "
Shopping and food,Busy at night but you can walk normally. You will find many asian foods and cafe... you can try many fresh juices 
Must go ,"This market is AMAZING for any person that enjoys shopping, they mostly have make up Korean stores, but you will also find H&M, Zara, Forever21 and others, also a lot of street food ( every booth is very clean ).You can easily spend here the whole afternoon with no problem at all, they have several cat cafe which i highly recommend to visit and one dog cafe which is amazing ( the cat cafe has an entrance fee of 8000 won and the dog cafe 9000 both include a drink with the entrance).I will recommend to come at night from Tuesday to Sunday, on Mondays not all the street vendors are there. Myeong-dong subway station exit 7 "
Shopping ,"That's it. Whether it is for cosmetics or clothes, or carving for food, or you want to go to great department stores, Myeongdong is the place you are looking for. "
Shop shop shop,"you can find almost anything here. huge area filled with delicious street foods, restaurants and shops"
Myeongdong,"When dropping by Myeongdong, YOU HAVE TO EAT THEIR STREET FOOD. I swear, everything I've tasted were really really good. I don't usually eat street food but theirs were—sorry for being redundant, really really good. Oh! And they have the trademark 32mm ice cream that Seoul is famous for. Myeongdong offers lots of beauty products. South Korea is famous for their cosmetics and ginseng products. You can find them here but at a slightly pricier price. We've been told that the market beside Myeongdong, which is Namdaemun, is very much like Myeongdong but the products come at a more reasonable price. "
Shopping & Eating Street,"It's a heaven street that combines food & shopping together ^^ it's a must visit place for all ladies. You can find shopping malls, restaurants, street foods & street shops. "
Amazing street food!,So much street food to try!! Grilled Cheese (3 won)Noodles (3 won)Ice cream in fish waffles with honey comb (4 won)MeatballsFish / octopus / chicken / pork skewers 
Best place for cosmetics and body products,Went with partner to shop for cosmetics and body products. Best pricing and concentration by far. Very value for money at a single spot. Very crowded though.
Shops and food.,"There were many, many stores that sold local goods. My son and dad ate street food which they enjoyed. Some store owners will haggle and others were not."
Day and night,We came there twice. Once at night to eat the street food and once during the day to shop. The eating was really yummy and fun experience. 2 or 3 vendors are quite filling already. Everything cost around 3000 to 6000 won. Shopping was so much fun. Especially the cosmetic stores. I was overwhelmed. And oh we went to a dog cafe too. We spent hours in there playing with dogs who are treated like kids with characters. So cute!
Street food galore,"The market was amazing with the varieties of street food and retail items for sale. Also the market is conveniently placed nearby the local shopping district. Amazing reasonably priced souvenirs, international restaurants, a few ""American"" stores and so much more. If you're a people watcher, this is the perfect location. "
Love the street ambiance,"Really nice walk around, lots of street stalls offering food, snacks, etc. There are also several coffee outlets to rest the tired feet. A good walk to window shop and people watch"
Busy shopping street full of great buys and food,Awesome place if you are a shopaholic and foodie. There are many stores to get a good buy especially Korean makeup and skincare. If you buy from them and are nice to them they are very generous with their skincare samples. Once evening comes the food vendors drag out their carts and sell their wares. So many things to eat. A meal made of all these food is actually more expensive then a sit down meal at a typical Korean restaurant but it's the experience that counts. Lots of interesting food to try. A must go if you can brave the crowds.
Cosmetics Cosmetics Cosmetics - leave your husband or boyfriend in the hotel,"Unless you have a very patient boyfriend or husband, leave them in the hotel or a coffe shop close by. I certainly did and so glad that I did. This gave me time to shop at different brands, tried out samples and bargained for the best price with the most free samples. A good afternoon work and thoroughly enjoyable! "
Best spot to shop in Seoul,Myeongdong is a area with full of shop and street food along the street. Go to here from about 5PM and find many Korean cosmetic brand with many free sample inside the shop. 
One-Stop Shopping Only,"Only visit if you have limited shopping time and looking for cosmetics and skincare. They do have almost all the korean brands here. As it is famous for shopping street, you will see all the tourist here (especially from Mainland China). Shop attendants will start greeting you in Chinese too.. Experienced very bad service as they will product push to you and once we dont buy, their face will turn really sour! Shops on the main streets will not give you product samples or disclose the promotion deals unless u ask for it. I get much more product samples, discount deals, and other perks fr shopping at the same brand stores located at other areas like Garosugil and Hongdae. Shoppers, be aware! Food prices are also higher when compared to other areas. With same price, you can get better quality food at other places. "
Cosmetic galore,"Think no further if you need to shop for the last minute face masks, lip sticks, eye liners etc. You will find Etude house, nature republic , face shop just to name a few. Watch out for the deals. Many of the shop assistants can speak mandarin, English and even Thai! All accept cash or credit cards"
Lots of cosmetic shops with street market along the streets,"Many cosmetic shops of the same brand and operating hours differ even though same company. Have to say, lots of PRC tourists around, so much so the staff at the shops are all fluent in mandarin. "
Shopping and hang out ,"It's a good place for shopping and to hang out and reminds me of London Oxford street. The other thing good about is it that had food stalls and you can try out many fresh food items from juices, snacks, to ice cream. But there is only one halal food shawarma stall or at times two. But plenty of seafood options along with vege too. "
cosmetics haven,"A lot of cosmetics sold here. Etude, skinfood, and many more. And theres a lot of street food and bbq restaurant too.. nice atmosphere here"
One of the best shopping areas in Seoul.,"I loved Myeongdong so much that whenever I had a chance to go shopping it would be my go to place. It's got literally everything you could need from a shopping area, mostly for women, from skin care, to shoes to brands, as well as the latest food fads courtesy of new shops and street vendors. The shops are a great range of korean brands, and western, meaning you can always find what you need. I did however find brands like Zara slightly too expensive, but the korean brands sell similar products for less! I particularly went for ALand, make sure to pop in for the latest fashions!"
Loved shopping here,Stopped off here ona one day visit with cruise ship absolutely loved the korean handicrafts and shops along this street. We wanted to buy so much but had limited room in the suitcase.
what a women street!,"over 70% shops are for women, including cosmetics and make ups, clothes , etc.Also, there are few bigs shoes shop like Foot lockers, ABC mart and Folders, a lot of fashionable sport shoes that suitable for both mens and womens.Recommend cosmetics brands: ""Banila col"": Zero make up remover cream, Shinny base, loose powder.Clio: BB cushion and water proof eyeliner"
"Delicious food, friendly atmosphere, and cat cafe's!","Tucked into the heart of Seoul, this shopping street has nice broad avenues perfect for a lot of pedestrian traffic. The streets are set in between three storey buildings on each side, and there are a LOT of different types of shops throughout. Everything is very clean and well maintained. At night this place really comes alive, with street food stalls everywhere, and loads of people selling goods from carts and streetside stalls.If you like shopping, or just want a neat urban experience, swing by Myeongdong."
Lots of shops and street vendors,"The Myeongdong area is a very busy area with lots of shops, street vendors and a good few restaurants.I would say it is worth the trip to experience some of the buzz of the city, and perhaps find some clothes for yourself as well.If you are an European, as I am, keep in mind that e.g. a medium or a large size t-shirt in Seoul (and in most of Asia) is not the same size as back home.Also, you will be hard pressed to find shoes in sizes larger than European 44."
Fun area to walk around,Great food vendors and cool stores everywhere. There are hundreds are shops for teenagers and not always the same thing. Also many places to eat. I would recommend the street food 
One of my favorite shopping places,"We went to Myeongdong several times during our trip. It is a great, fun, busy shopping area. It has a good mix of retail chains, small shops, traditional, fun, modern, street food and restaurants. A little of everything is a good size but not overwhelming area. I found Dongdaemun too huge and endless. In the early evening - all the awesome street food vendors come out! We also went several times because we saw the Nanta show, got our Hanbok pictures taken at Gogun studios, we ate pretty autentic American pizza, kids loved the spiral ice cream cones. Also there are several banks -Citibank where you can pull out money. It's street shopping but many larger air conditioned stores you can go into also. "
Favourite place for shopping,"There are a lot of Korean brand cosmetics shops that offer instant tax refund to foreigners. In the evening, the streets are full of temporary stalls that sell food, clothing, accessories, etc. The streets, however, would resume cleanliness the next day with no trace of garbage. You can also find restaurants with good food at reasonable price in the area. This is my favourite shopping area in Seoul."
Another place for shopping,Lots of people and it's shopping after shopping and more shopping - this is a great place for currency exchange since you get the best deals. Some nice restaurants and the prices are ok- pretty reasonable. I also heard that this is the place where people go under the knife and I did see a few girls walking on the streets with bandages etc...hmm...safe and a good place for endless shopping
Girls paradise,"Everywhere is cosmetic shops, cafe and restaurants. Girls will definitely love it. It is a place for tourists and therefore price is higher compare to other area. "
It has everything you need,"Myeongdong is that special area in Seoul that provides everything you will ever want to eat, buy, or see. A great place to spend a day, but just one!"
Bustling market lanes,"Fashion, cosmetics especially, also street food stalls. An interesting stroll on a busy night in Seoul."
Mostly Cosmetics,"It was good walking in Myeongdong. However, the food price is basically expensive. Although, this might be considered as a shopping haven for those who loves cosmetics!"
Popular place a good location,A good place for shopping and eat have many delicious restaurant and also local food on the way everything in Seoul can find it here
Myeongdong Street. ,"It's a safe place to shop and dine. Ladies are spoilt for choice for beauty products and accessories. No sign of touts or hustlers, you can shop peacefully. Foodies will loved the many varieties of food joints available, coffee lovers will have a hard time choosing the right cafe to have their drip. Also many beer and fried chicken joints. "
MUST IN SEOUL,"It a Must if you visiting seoul , a lot of shopping store in a wide open streets most of them for walking only, you will find cheap stuff or high brands, all in one place.. "
Shops everywhere!,"First thing you’ll see is a big UNIQLO store, then from there endless stores front back left and right. It’ll get you excited if you love shopping. The store can get too repetitive (incase you changed your mind). They also have small food stalls along the streets. Would definitely come back! "
Great holiday feel,Bustling street with lots of street food option and plenty of restaurant. I would have rated it 5 star if not for the vast amount of tourist from china. 
Heaven for Makeup and Skincare Lovers! ,I absolutely love Myeongdong! I fell in love with all the lights and all the stuff that's being sold here. Every street has at least 4-7 makeup or skincare stores. It's also good to try Korean street food here. I would really go back here and would want to get lost again.✌️
Love it,"This place has all you need. Thousands of shops and street food. OMG the street food is amazing, especially at night time. This place is a must. "
Overwhelming!,"Even if you don't like shopping, you should experience this area. If you like to shop, you'll be in heaven! We stumbled onto this area walking around and, wow! It was late on a Sunday night and it was teeming with people. There are so many shops including the largest Uniqlo in Seoul. You can also grab a street snack from vendors between shops. "
Street food and stores,Great place to stop by if youre looking to shop and eat street food along te way. Found more variety of street food (particularly in the evening) than other street markets in Seoul. Gets pretty busy and there is traffic occasionally going through. Try and travel light if here (no strollers).
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Myeong-dong covers 0.99 km² with a population of 3,409 and is mostly a commercial area, being one of Seoul's main shopping and tourism districts. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Myeong-dong was listed as the ninth most expensive shopping street in the world. The area has many department stores, restaurants, upscale shops and boutiques."
Mixed review ,"First day I arrived in Seoul I walked there. Since I was booked at a hotel nearby it didn't take me long to hit the makeup and beauty heaven. I had comed prepared and written down everything I wanted. And I assume I did acted as a typical tourist, now where I'm from if the store worker asks if I need help and I decline politely they leave me alone. Not here be prepared to have someone follow you around literally right behind you. If you do find something that you want be sure that they also trying to convince you to buy other items that you ""MUST"" have. It was funny the first 2 stores but after 6 it starts to get annoying. I didn't experience any of that in the clothing stores like Forever 21. Oh and if you want to experience some of he wonderful street food head there around 6 P.M. KST "
"Lots to look at, buy and eat","You will never be bored here. It is the ladies' dream shopping area and the boyfriend/hubby's nightmare. There are so many different cosmetics and facial products to be bought. There are many street vendors too. I bought clothes for my dogs and hats for myself from them. When you are tired, you can dine at the many restaurants found there. "
Shop Till You drop,So many choices and varieties to suit different budgets. Activities came alive especially during later in the night and you can shop to your heart's content.
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Shoppers can go crazy with the range of cosmetics they can get. The shops give freebies with purchases and most shops will have staff who knows how to speak Chinese. The street stalls start after 11am, and it's definitely fun trying out their snacks while shopping"
Cant understand the Language so not good for foreigners,We went to this market with big hopes as it was mentioned as biggest flea market in Seoul but it was a bad experience for us as either the shopkeepers didn't understand english or were not ready to bargain. we came back empty handed after 3 hours.
Glitz and glamour ,"If you like the hustle and bustle and bright shiny lights this is the place for you. Comes alive at night although day is also great for people watching. Be prepared to be lured into beauty stores flogging all sorts of dodgy treatments, masks and anything you can imagine to achieve beauty and everlasting youth.Otherwise trendy brand name stores at retail prices and fairly touristy eating places. The foot long parfait / ice cream vendor was popular on a hot day"
Busy and Hectic place for make up shopping,"If u only have limited days in Seoul, so you can get anything here, the cosmetic's shops is all around, coffee shops, even cat cafe and dogs cafe also avail. they also sell food street when start being evening time. so you can just stay here ..."
Shopping Haven,"Many attractive shops, malls and kto nearby. There are many popular restaurants and cafes here. You can try a haircut at hair salons found everywhere. Street can get crowded even on weekdays but this doesn't deter us from returning. Love the street snacks too! Very convenient location with 2 subway stations nearby (Euljiro 1ga and Myeongdong). Consider staying at hotels locates here. I'm going to return again! "
street food and lots of shopping!!,"If you really love Korean street food and makeup, this is the best place to be! It is great to find anything you are looking for korean cosmetics and makeup! There are many shops and you can have a walk around while enjoying delicious korean street food like tteokkbokki, heotteok and fish cakes!"
Shopping and Food Heaven!,"Shopping and food heaven for all. Lots of interesting food to eat. Halal options are available though limited, need to look around. Variety of choices of shops for you to shop in. Street food is awesome here! You should really really try the street food. Lots of variety as well! A place to visit in Seoul."
Heaven For Skin Care & Cosmetic Shoppers,"It was a weekday evening but it was so crowded. Shoppers are mostly foreigners (China, HK, Malaysia.. ). All the popular brands like Innisfree, Nature Republic etc are here. If you are skin care/cosmetic lover, this is the place for you. You may enjoy great discount up to 30% at certain outlets, tax refund on the spot for certain amount, and freebies! Remember to bring your passport along for tax refund purpose! Most of the Korean sales girl here speak Chinese too. Be sure to check the streetfood out too! Note: Compared to most of the outlet of same brand in Busan, they dont offer much discount and tax refund on the spot, but they can give you more freebies, just ask for it!"
An interesting experience,"Cosmetics are the big thing in Korea and this area of Seoul has countless cosmetic outlets offering everything imagineable, at discount, with freebies. It is interesting to see but, after a while, it all just gets too much. It's well worth a visit though, just for the experience, and the street market is more varied in what it offers."
"Streetfood, shops and deals!","I have visited Myeongdong now several times, and I think I prefer going to eat streetfood and not so much for shopping because it's a mess when it comes to shopping, also its really touristy. Their are resources avaliable if you need English/Chinese/Japanese translation. Definetly a must see for a trip to Seoul, just to experience it, once during the day and at night!"
Extremely touristy but great for skincare/makeup shopping,"Touristy is good in that all the shops are there so if you have a list of things you want it's pretty easy to knock it down there, because there are 10 of each shop (innisfree, laneige, etude house etc etc) at every corner you turn. The bad side was that I think there were more foreigners than koreans there, so I would only treat it purely as a 'shop and get out of there' kind of place. If you can speak chinese and not korean, this place is great because all the staff speak chinese to some extent. "
"Shops, shops, cosmectic shops","If you are shopping for cosmetics, this is the place. There are many restaurants and convenient stores too. In the evenings, the street stalls open and there's plenty of street food too. More stalls open during the weekends. Very suitable place for those who love cosmetics and food."
Happening shopping area ! ,Definitely very enjoyable to shop here. Wide variety of international brands and Korean fashion and cosmetics. Lots of street food as well ! Enjoy eating and drinking your way through this shopping haven !! 
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"If you are cosmetic shopping gals, you definitely love this shopping district. Lots of beauty shops that you can buy stuff from; but street food can be pricey."
Great shopping area,Great area for shopping not far from metro underground from seoul station. Nice surroundings and great food and coffee shops. Worth a visit.
Full of cosmetics shops!,"We noticed that the street offers soooo many cosmetic shops...you name it...you've got it! All are Korean brands...of course! Apart from that, there are a lot of shops selling clothes...bags...shoes...you name it! You also can find many good restaurants, including Halal eating place."
Popular Street,"It's a very popular street, it's an amazing place where you can find street food and a lotoof shops to buy the last new special facial mask or the new cream for your face or hands! If you go to Seoul you must go there!"
Night Shopping Galore!,"I visited this area during the day and at night. If you want a laid-back shopping experience, I highly recommend going during the day. But the night shopping is wonderful! The area has a ton of cafes and restaurants to choose from. This includes dog and cat cafes. They have vendors that sell street food and tourist gifts in the streets as well as plenty of stores with clothing and beauty products. I highly recommend Myeongdong, even if you just want to walk around! "
Shoppers heaven ,"You can literally find anything here for everyone with reasonable cheap price. Girls will like the tons of cosmetic products, kids will love some toys there and food lover will be satisfied by variety of street food and restaurants. I would hope there are more public restrooms available, you have to go to subway station which is also crowded or customer of restaurants to use it. I found this inconvenience when my little one suddenly need to use it. Other annoying things is lot of sales person that trying to give you free sample on the street and take it away if you didn't enter the store. Otherwise this is a good heaven for shoppers and must go attraction in Seoul. "
Great food and shopping,very fun place to walk around and try the different types of food. very tourist based shopping and a lot of makeup stores. 
Shopping District ,Definitely the Shopping district. Lots of beauty shops that you can buy stuff from. Just a tip: food can be pricey here.
Has everything you need!,"Be it fashion, hair salon, makeup, skincare, restaurants, or souvenirs, Myeongdong street has everything! You can't be bored coming here and will end up buying things! Korean makeup stores are in every corner of the street and offer good deals of makeup and skincare.If you're looking for clothes, 8 seconds and topten are my recommendations!"
Shop till u drop,Go on a weekend late afternoon for the best picks of food n everything else. The tourist information offers free hanbok try-outs. Just go n book a time. Also lots of information guides around to help
great food street....,"lots of awesome street food, every night of the week, lots of cosmetic shops and well as clothes etc. must visit at least once during your visit to seoul, to see all the young people out shopping and having fun"
Great fun,"Each of the shopping areas/streets are different and offer their own charm. Though it seems to be geared toward beauty products, there are still options for every need/want. We stopped through on the way to N Seoul Tower and was a lot of fun."
June school holiday vacation ,"Very happening place. There were buskers in the day and at night there were Street food carts. We shopped there 3 days in a row and ended up buying earphones, sports shoes, food. Picture shows the drinks and ice cream /cake we ate at a cafe which sells all the green tea products. We went there twice in 2 days as we like the food so much. Also ate at a bbq restaurant, couldn't remember the name. The usual stuff, grilled korean beef. Worth visiting place. "
"For shopping and street food, this is your spot","Great spot for the full-on assault of consumerism - mostly clothes and shoe and cosmetic shops. This is not the place for the chic Seoul boutiques or hand-crafts but if you want big brands and lots of them, spend a few hours here. If you like street food, come here at night - it's very vibrant and great fun and the food is good. Wash it down with a beer or two at one of the bars - happy days :-)"
Hours of shoppings ,There are so many things to do here. Mostly you will find shops selling cosmetics and skincare products. Some fashion shops scattered around. I prefer to do my fashion shopping at dongdaenum area. You will be approached by many touters from restaurants. Try to avoid these restaurants. The food tends to be lousy and expensive. Walk around and seek the busiest looking restaurants. Those are the ones you want to try. 
Nice shopping area,"Cheaper than dongdaenum shopping area. I bought a pair of shorts for krw 10,000 and when I went to myeongdong it was only kwn 5,900! A lot of street food and cheap clothes ( but i suggest you go around and compare prices). Definitely will come back to this place again especially for shopping. "
Bustling street with tons of korean make-up brands,"Myeongdong is mainly known for the endless numbers of Korean make-up brands, each having more than one branch. When you do buy a considerable amount from a store (approx 30,000 kw), do expect them to give you free samples and if they do not, it's completely normal to ask so don't be shy. There are stores that sell sports shoes/sneakers and prices for some are not bad, especially taking into account the tax refund you can get. Tax refunds require a minimum spend of 30,000 kw in a single receipt and some stores give it to you instantly so you don't have to do it at the airport, do ask beforehand if they have that liberty. There are plenty of stalls selling streetfood and I find them to be generally more hygienic than some other Asian countries. However I can easily say I very much prefer streetfood in Taipei, but restaurants in Seoul. Speaking of which, Myeongdong is similar to Ximending of Taipei, if you have been there.Just across the street is Lotte Young (take the underground pass through the train station), where you can find slightly higher end make-up brands like 3CE by Stylenanda, blogshop clothes, sports brands, UNIQLO, MUJI etc. Lotte Departmental Store is connected to Lotte Young, and there is a huge area with lots of eateries, cafes and a foodcourt. "
shopping street,"Very vibrant shopping street with all major Korean cosmetic brands. The Olive Young Store with 2 levels is a convenient place to get everything in one spot, especially if you are looking for a variety of face masks!Most of the sales staff seemed to understand Mandarin."
Shopping,The cosmetic at the Myongdong is very reasonable price and good quality. A lot of people to visit there. I also bought a lot .
It is a popular shopping street,"This is a very crowded place regardless of day and time. You can get almost anything here, especially facial products."
Crowded and fun,"Some tips... If you are looking for money changer, try to find some in alley not in a main street. The rate is favourable especially for USD. It is quite a fun street shopping and we find it cheap rather than japan and singapore. The food is best in alley.. Some bbq place near mcd is good and reasonable prices. "
"Street food, shopping ","Everybody speak Chinese and English, brand cloth, delicious street food - but it seems to me - not so authentic. Must visit as Namdaemoon market"
Enough is enough ,"4th time here and I just breed through this place. If you're thinking of enjoying Seoul. Try Hongdae, Ehwa, Samchengdong nearby or further afar places like Itaewon, Appejong, Gangnam or the new Lotte Plaza. "
INTERESTING PLACE TO SEE,There are lots of street food vendors. It is not the best place to shop as some of the items are of poor quality - a good place to take in the atmosphere
Happenin Shopping street,Lots of shops to go as well as kind of nights market s with foods and goodies sold. It is very happening especially at night. every day of the week. we went 3 times and always new things to discover. shop till you die lol
A shopping maze,"You will find the latest Korean craze from cosmetics to clothes and Korean street snacks here. Almost every face/body care shop is offering discounts on cosmetics and masks. If you are not ready to buy it from one street, you will likely see it again in another. In other words, no hurry to buy. There is one street that is lined with Korean street stalls so leave room to try out the local snacks."
Place for outfits,"Be ready to buy two of the same kind, you may get different colors but you have to get two pieces to be able to buy it. This area is known for wholesale market. Price is quite reasonable."
shopping,"I like some of the stores in the Myungdong area, with large western brand stores along the main strip and around, and smaller boutique type shops on the side streets. It is definitely a busy street so if you don't like crowds I would suggest avoiding it."
Blast.,"Seoul is boring, unless you're a shopaholic or nightlife person. With a you family, THIS market is not to be missed. You want to go after dinner, but with room still in your belly for street snacks. It's busiest/coolest late in the evening."
Cosmetics paradise,"i love korean cosmetics. they are really very expensive. but in myeongdong, can buy at 50% off. so good value for money. huge place. a lot of tourist visiting. totally love the place."
Masks ,"Only operates from 4pm till 11pm. Things a bit high,foods are all done by Chinese from China. Crowded .sells lots of masks. Near subway.near lotto.Lots of shops .nice place "
Interesting Not Cheap,You will find good bargains and a large variety of items. Street food vendors are awesome. Great snacks and food to keep you going while shopping and window shopping. Wear comfortable shoes. 
Nice place to suck it all in,"But not to really shop i figured. The athmosphere is amazing. Definitely! You can find all sorts of products. Textile mostly but also kitchenware, toys and food. Anything you need. But i habe been a lot to asian Markets and so the product range didnt blow me off my feet. All the same fake and low quality stuff you need (or not). Even though they also habe some authentic korean things."
great shopping,Lots of skin care product stores.They give out lots of free samples if U buy from them. no minimum purchase mecessary. easy to find. Lots of cafes as well. There isa Hello Kitty cafe on the second floor along Myeongdong street if you are a fan.
Trendy shopping paradise that you shud visit!,"Singapore has Orchard shopping street whilst Seoul has Myeongdong as its trendy shopping paradise.Undoubtedly this place is always busy and crowd with tourists or locals, even more packed during weekend. Many shops along the street in this area are selling from clothes, bags, shoes, to skin care and cosmetics products; not to mention cafes and restaurants to lush thrist and hunger after tiring strolling around for hours.Cons: majority clothes sizes in Korea are quite small, thus probably a bit challenging for Caucasian to find suitable sizes."
Tourist Stop - Shopping,"Very good shopping place. came here for 4 times over 6 days in Seoul. The place is packed with good food, famous joints and good shopping with decent price points :)"
Bustling night street,This place is livelier in the night than in the daytime as the pushcarts are only available at night. It's basically a cosmetic shops street with a few clothing stores if you explore more behind (the smaller alleys). Plenty of street food but not cheap. More restaurants at the back alley towards Shinsegae. There is this spicy spare rib soup in one of the alleys which is crowded & delicious. OneDang Gamjatang Myeongdong Store 1. Tel no. 02-757 7612. Interesting street to stroll around at night.
"Streets after streets full of cosmetics, face masks and food","You can get lost in myeongdong! My hotel was at the heart of myeongdong shopping street and we go out every night for food and explore the shops. Majority shops sells cosmetics and facial masks and they all the same. Buy 1 get 1 free or 50% off is very common and if you work out the prices, they are all the same! So if you going to buy facial masks, buy from their official store to avoid any fakes.Food is great! many restaurants to try and different types as well. Price wise, Korean bbq is expensive and street food is expensive because they give you very small portions. If you like ttekboki I suggest you buy from Myeongdong station underground shops (same price but gave you double the amount of food).You can still bargain in myeongdong but they won't discount it that much.... This place is pretty much filled with Chinese tourist! If you don't speak Korean but speaks Chinese, you're OK! They always speak some chinese...."
Busy!,Great shopping place with a lot of selections. Tons of stores give you freebies enough to stack your whole travel vanity purse. Plenty of places where you could eat too.
Cosmetic shop everywhere!!! ,"Lots of cosmetic shop everywhere in the street ! Pls compare the prices 1st then go to the cheapest, some shop do duty free on the same time,some doesn't so u need to get it at airport. But korean is not as friendly as japan ! Most of them hav bad attitude!! No matter young or old !!! For my personal ,i won't visit more then one time for holidays compare to others coutry! But for cosmetic shopping I'll . Below is some of street snack pic on the night ! And the cat cafe lots of cats for cats lovers !!! So do recommend it for cosmetic shopping !!! "
horrid...,"over crowded and chaotic, my least favourite walking street in Seou. Unless you really want to get the cheap Korean face masks, i would rather give it a miss..."
Good Modern Shopping,This is a good spot for a variety of food choices along with all your more modern fashion. It's a little more expensive than other areas but I think it's worth it for the unlimited accessibility to so many things. 
Nice small area with plenty of cosmetics stores,In the evening the food cars take the street so you can have your dinner/snacks on streets. Price is about 3 € per food. Sweet and salty food available.
"shop, eat and people watching","shopping galore, lots of eateries, safe and good rate money changers. rare find at Lotteria Burger Restaurant. lots of people during night time"
Good and Trendy Shopping Street,"This is a nice shopping area where you canbuy many fashionable clothes, famous worldwide and Korean cosmetic items. You can get many street dishes, try a number of restaurants.Nice experience to be in this shopping area."
One day cannot shop finish!!,"Full of comestic shop food stall.i think u need spend many day just wan walk all the shop and try all the food.night time alot street foos.always open until 11pm midnight.bring your empty stomach to try all of it.comestic mask remember compare shop by shop.some product will more expensive than other place.if you stay near here,u may compare price at other place first.other place may cheaper like hongdae."
Great for Tourists,"This place is curated for tourists. There is a great variety of food and more new types of street food. Also, there are a lot of stores and cafes."
Hey its what you do when you visit,"I had late lunch/ early dinner in the colourful Myeongdong St. I enjoyed looking at the restsraunts and shops. Enjoyed a yummy meal cooked on the plate, they showed me how to cook and eat the food on the lettice leaf. With Korean rice wine off course. Didn't get to see the nightlife. If you are in the area worth a look. I went there after visiting the garden of morning calm. Together make a nice relaxing day trip from Seoul."
Great for shopping,"Myeongdong is really fun to walk around and get a feel for Seoul. There are lots of Korean brand shops, cafes and cosmetic shops, you can easily spend an entire day walking around window shopping here."
Very underwhelming,"I thought this would be a shopping mecca, judging from pictures I saw online of how packed the crowds are. It's a mecca of sorts, but for makeup/cosmetics/skin care shopping. The majority of shops are the same cosmetics brands repeating themselves in different alleys. There are some major clothing stores like Uniqlo and Zara, but for the most part, there simply wasn't enough variety. "
Myeongdong,"a paradise for cosmetic / skincare shoppers. mainly mid price point Korean cosmetic brands. lots of shops are bundling their masks such as you pay for 5pcs, you get another 5pcs free (or 10 for 10pcs etc).also lots of eateries, we had andong (braised) chicken for lunch. bingsu for dessert."
Shopping and eating mecca of Seoul,"Myeongdong is the main shopping district of Seoul, but it offers much more than just shopping. While you can find many major brands stores here, there are plenty of street food vendors, restaurants, and bars. It is worth coming here to people watch, eat, and window shop and just take in the hustle and bustle."
Rows of shops selling facial products. ,Filled with rows of shops selling facial products and street food. One stop selection - prefer to shop here than at lotte duty free which was filled with Chinese Tourists. 
Delightedly surprised,"Came here mid Dec 2015 just before Christmas, as a family with 3 young adult children. Just curious to visit Korea but not really expecting much. We were delightedly surprised to find Myeongdong perfect for a Christmas break. Its cold weather suited us since we live in a tropical country. The festivity of the street with lights, people, shops and food, were just amazing! Oh the street food was even more amazing! They came out in an organized manner starting sundown and very organized, very efficient and very clean! The food were a variety and all enticing to eat. The vendors were friendly and the atmosphere fun! My children felt like they were in a theme park, not knowing where to head first-- the food or the shops! Of course there were plenty of people, locals and foreigners flick here. We didn't mind the bustling crowd, heck it was Christmas season and we were feeling young & invigorated by the street activity. The street literally comes alive! We were booked in the area nearer to the Catholic church, where it was near to walk from all the activity but quiet in our rooms. There being a Catholic church in the MD area was very ideal since we heard masses for a birthday celebration, anniversary celebration and a Sunday worship in different days during our stay. The Nanta theater is also in the middle of this area, where we enjoyed the show very much. A little hole in the wall allowed us to enjoy samgyeopsal, a popular Korean dish that is commonly served as an evening meal. It consists of thick, fatty slices of pork belly meat. The meat, usually neither marinated nor seasoned, is cooked on a grill at the diners’ table. Usually diners grill the meat themselves and eat directly from a grill. It is typically served with ssamjang Korean vegetables, and lettuce leaves to wrap it in. For a family with young adults, exploring the area is like opening gifts! We felt like children in a candy store, our eyes filled with all sorts of treats. The locals were not all well-versed in English but can be understood with smiles, sign language, body language. Of course, you can't help that it may be more expensive to stay here than in other areas but hey, we want to be in the center of the action, and enjoy our 8day stay! All in all, we rank Myeongdong excellent for our first-time vacation place."
Awful. Just Awful.,"This is a crowded, VERY loud venue. Mostly uninteresting department stores, each with a sound system trying to outdo its neighbor. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Go to Insadong instead, a craft/market area that has lots of local flavor and is very fun. Myeongdong Street was our least favorite venue of our entire trip."
A good place to enjoy night market experience & street food (non-halal),"So many shops available for clothing according to your budget but definitely not as cheap as the local markets in Seoul. Variety of Korean Street food available for cuisine hunters. For Muslim travellers, this area is not feasible for food selection. As for Malaysian currency, the clothing are quite pricey."
A must-do,"You cannot come to Seoul without visiting this place where shopping is the main aim. They have everything here!!! Big name shops and all brands of skincare can be found here. Besides that, it's a good paradise where many food chains are here. Besides that, it comes alive at 6-11pm where all the street hawkers come! Cheap and unique street foods can be found here!"
Make Up Shopping,"Be sure you have a list of make ups you want to buy. Because you will be overwhelmed with so many choices, all promising of a good smooth skin after using ending up being able not to buy anything. Try also all the street food, its worth it."
"Crowds, fun, icecream, bargains!","Lovely place to get the vibe of shopping for good street food - I can highly recommend the ice creams!! Plenty of bargains to be found, and so many people jostling their way through the myriad of shops. It's a good idea to just sit and watch the passing traffic for a while. Much nicer place to find souvenirs, etc. - Korea is not a cheap country to shop in, and most large shopping centres are full of brand names at exhorbitant prices. Plenty of great restaurants to have dinner. No smoking allowed in the street."
A must for the shoppers out there,"Myeongdong shopping district attracts millions of people every year and it's not hard to see why. There's plenty of stores to keep you shopping for hours. There's also plenty of street food at night and restaurants to keep your mouth watering.Down side is the cosmetic stores are repetitive as you'll find the same brand on every main street. This worked well for my wife as if one store ran out of a product, the next store would have it. Plenty of walking so wear comfy shoes and ofcourse accept the massive crowed If you want to avoid the crowd just go earlier in the day but I think the hussle and bussle heightens the experience. "
Typical high end shopping ,"We've been shopping all throughout Asia this past trip, Tokyo and Hong Kong included. You'll find designer and local brands here but it's not a really interesting area to explore. It reminds me of the typical brand name streets you'll find anywhere and not uniquely Korean. But there are good restaurants and shopping in this area. It's just not my favorite area to explore so far."
Shopping paradise,"Not only shopping but street food paradise. A lot of beauty stores are everywhere. Zara, H&M, Forever 21 located along the main road. There are also hundreds of local fashion small shops around. Choose the one u like more.You won't be left hungry if you prefer restaurants rather than street food. Though the prices there are a bit higher than in other parts of Seoul.For pets lovers there are Cat Cafes and Dog Cafes, i visited both and advise you to do the same :)"
Croudy and pleasant,"Should go there at night for the street food! Shopping in Korea is expensive, but the street food is amazing."
shopping galore,here you can see value for money beauty products and delicious foods!!! must visit when in seoul and must shop all day!!
Great experience for street food & shopping,"Visited primarily for the street food experience which was good although the place does get quite crowded. Tried a lot of the street food and we found most of it to be quite good. Most of the dishes will be KRW 2,000 - 4,0000 per serving. If you do try the grilled chicken skewers from Park Hyo Shin Dak would suggest taking it easy on the ""hydrogen bomb"" sauce. It is loaded with cayenne pepper among other spices and a bit spicier than we anticipated. Best time to go for food experience is after sunset -- also the time when it's the busiest. "
good,"Good places for shopping,come to myeongdong with your family! don't forget for come to myeongdong when you come to south korea"
Great place to stroll,This place is vibrant in the afternoon and evening. It seems that there are more tourists here than locals. It is a great place to walk around.
Go for the Street Food,"The Myeongdong area is known for shopping, in particular for make-up. There are numerous stores like Missha, Nature Republic, Etude House, Innis, H&M, and Zara. As a foreigner living in Seoul or a tourist this is a great place to get the best of Korean make-up products and those western clothing stores you might need. But secretly, my wife and I go there for the street food. It is always jam packed, even in the cold months of Fall with food vendors. You can try out the latest trend or just get the classics like a crepe. Check out this area for a unique experience of shopping and food!"
See it once and it's enough.,"This part of town is very crowded by either 1) school girls/boys and teenagers, 2) (Chinese) tourists or 3) young crowd.So if you want to mingle with them, it's great as you can feel the young and lively atmosphere especially at night. But it's mostly packed and not so enjoyable in my opinion. Mostly there are only makeup brand shops, which is also overrun by Chinese tourists that you feel very neglected by the staff who kinda look like they want to be anywhere else. Since there are so many of the same brands elsewhere in town, I'd recommend you doing your shopping there."
Go shopping!,"I love here so much! Shopping is everywhere. I love shopping here, Korea cosmetics, clothes and food."
Shopping and Street Food,"this is a good place to have street food and bargain prices for make-up, socks and other fashion items"
Shopping haven for ladies,The picture says it all. It's SHOPPING HAVEN FOR LADIES!! Beauty products as far as your eyes can see. 
Great place for its food and atmosphere,"There are quite a number of signature local restaurants and street food there which make it convenient to try good food. As for the skincare products and cosmetics shop, I feel that you can get better prices at the Lotte Duty Free nearby if you are planning to buy a lot of stuff. If not, you can consider shopping for them at the university districts (i.e. Hongdae or Ewha) as the promotions might be better and they offer more samples as well since they are less popular areas for skincare shopping as compared to Myeongdong."
Nice Place to Go Shopping,"When it comes to fashion, Myeongdong has a mix of Korean and international brands. The Korean brands are interesting as they are not global brands that you can easily find anywhere in the world and some of them have unique products (in terms of designs). What was shocking was the number of skincare/cosmetics shops here; one brand can have several stores within Myeongdong Shopping Streets. Secondly, there weren't that many Koreans, but instead most people here were tourists.Food was not difficult to find, but perhaps due to the popularity of the area with tourists, the prices were slightly higher than in comparable restaurants in different areas. "
Evening stroll with so much to see and do!,The evening street market is well worth the effort. Great food choices and the summer nights are perfect for exploring and enjoying.
Love the Shopping,"Myeongdong night market is excellent, if you are here the first time, you will probably get lost from the streets after streets of shopping. You will never be bored here. The street food is a must try. "
Love the street food,"Love the street food best to come at night, shops are also opened but was mostly their for the food i came back twice in one week! Definitely should visit at least one , tried basically everything! so much to try"
Amazing shopping street,There are so many stores in Myeongdong. It is an amazing street to be shopping at. Do note that most of the big brand stores close around 9-11:30 PM. There are still some small shops open late at night and street food stores still on the streets. It is a huge shopping area so you might get lost. If you are going with your friends; it is best to stay together. Majority of store employees are really good at speaking Mandarin.
Street food and stalls,Went to Myeongsong shopping street for street food and soak the atmosphere. Interesting to eat different kind of street food. 
Good for luxury shopping but not good for bargains,"This area has a lot of overpriced stores selling luxury goods. It is not good for the average traveler and it is no different from other shopping areas you can find in big cities in the west. Restaurants are also more expensive here than in most other areas of Seoul. It is a good area to change your money though, several currency exchange places here. "
Shopping paradise for ladies,Myeong-dong is a definitely a shopping paradise. It has almost everything. There are endless rows of cosmetic shops to local and international fashion to pretty restaurants that nestled in between the rows of shops to delicious local snacks. All the Korean cosmetic brands can be found within 50 metres from each other. Prices are really affordable and the cosmetic shops here are more generous with freebies and samples.Best place for shopaholics!
Shopping paradise for ladies,This shopping area is full of cosmetics shops and nice restaurants to have your meals at. There are many cosmetic shops of the same brand name all over Myeongdong. 
The street food is awesome.,Myeongdong is a huge market area for shopping and street food. I was staying close to this area so landed up coming to the market every day. It is always crowded. the street food is just amazing. Carry cash to enjoy the street food. 
"Buzzing with energy, a shopper's paradise!","Equivalent to London's Oxford Street, only more crowded it seemed, Myeongdong is truly a shopper's paradise. Visit for clothing , accessories but especially cosmetics. Each of the Korean brands have their shops here... The Face Shop, Etude, Club Clio, Skin Food, Missha etc. and it seems one in every street!! With food hawkers, cafes and an incessant stream of shoppers, this place is buzzing with young energy!"
Wonderful ,This is truly the heart of Seoul. With locals and tourists mingling and a lively atmosphere and lots to see and do. Quaint tea houses and so many shops selling things unique to the area and unique to the country. As a tourist it's a must! Don't miss out on the famous Red Ginseng Tea. Yes it's a little expensive but certainly worth it because you won't find it anywhere else. And the sweet white floury stuff with nuts in it--I totally forgot the name but you will know exactly what I mean when you see it being made in the side of the street. Take your time and don't rush. Take it all in because it's a truly special unique experience. Enjoy! 
Better to shop at other area,"Really crowded, especially around afternoon until night. The staff mainly speaks Korean and Chinese, but not really friendly. Also, usually the shops are full even moving around will be difficult."
Shopaholic's heaven!,"If you only have time for one place to unleash your inner shopaholic in Seoul, Myeongdong is the place you have to visit! With several flagship stores and lots of skin care stores, you'll definitely be occupied the whole afternoon. If you're looking for halal food in the area, check out the HHWT Travel Planner (it's free)!"

Best place for street food and comfortable,There's so so so many beauty shops here. Almost every shop has its discount and promotion. And also there's so much food after 5pm. You can never get hungry at this area. 
Insane,This place is where you want to go for endless rows of beauty products and fashionable clothing shops. Restaurants and money changers are plenty as well. Street food stalls are also abundant. 
Good outdoor shopping ,"Very tourist place.. Good outdoor shopping, better at night.. Lots of food. Nearby there is shinsigae dept store and lotte shopping complex if you prefer indoor shopping."
Incredible place,"Been there at least 3 times during our trip and we keep finding things to buy and there's plenty of food to eat. However, it'll be better if there's recommended place for food else you'll be walking round"
A Must Visit While in Seoul,"After getting dropped off, immediately bought some cut-up watermelon for 5,000 won ($4.50) at the 1st stand we saw...On a hot day, it is worth the splurge for the fam. Then found some internet at McD and walked two shops down and up the stairs for a huge dish of Kalbi that easily fed four folks (cost of $38 is totally worth it)."
gotta come here at night for the food stalls!,"shopping area full of beauty products...but the real fun is when evening comes and all the food stalls set up.tasty, hot, inexpensive good eats to have and walk around...plus, beat the daytime heat!"
Lots of cosmetics and clothes for young generations ,"If u are well versed with the KdRama and kpop scenes Your eyes will thoroughly enjoy the scenes.As DOTS drama was so popular, u see SJK posters endorsing almost every product imaginable.At night time lots of food stalls line the streets with Korean street food "
the main shopping district in seoul (money exchange rate here is the best),here you can find all kind of famous Korean brands selling clothes or cosmetics and many types of food and restaurants. also there are many types of fresh and delicious street food that i recommend you try all. there are also money exchange stores with the best exchange rates you can find in seoul so i recommend you exchange your money here but look for different stores to get the best rate
The Busy Street of Myeongdong,"Myeondong shopping street is amazing.. Much more at night.. Youll enjoy the delicious food, the shops, the things theyre selling. I so love it.. During our trip, we are at myeongdong st. Every night... I really miss It. So amazing so beautiful "
Skin care capital of the world,"This street is known for stores selling skin care products. Most stores will give you free samples just for coming in. Go there your first day in Seoul, walk in and out of stores, get free sample and try it out at night back in your hotel room. You might one to pick up a facial mask or too to try if you don't get one as a free sample. On the second to last day in Seoul, buy the products you tried AND liked to take home. Given the ubiquity of the products and the conversion rate, it is incredibly inexpensive compared to what you would pay in the US. for example, a floral based mask at Sephora sells for $4 each. With the buy 10 get 10 free specials there, each mask averaged out to 50 cents!!!! These shops are all over Seoul, you don't have to go the myeongdong again. It's good for the first day because of the concentration of shops; you can hit so many stores in a short period of time. Additionally, because the stores are so concentrated there, the competition to get you into the stores are more intense, hence, all the free samples. "
Don't miss the market at night,Delicious food vendors everywhere. From exotic seafood choices to spiral potato-on-a-stick to crepes - it's a lovely delicious food fest every night.
Never fail to be my favourite,"Myeongdong has always been my favourite place to stay at as basically what you need can be found here i.e great food, great shopping, DFS, hair salon, optical shop. However, it is always so busy or you can call it vibrant."
Shopping Market ,"Myeong-dong Market is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main drags meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Cosmetic and Fashion has many branded shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores include Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices. You will find many family restaurants, fast food, plus Korean, Western and Japanese dining. Do try Egg Pan Cake on the street."
Crowded but interesting,Be prepared for the crowds. Had excellent street food here and shopping is fantastic! Lots of little alleyways to explore for boutique shops.
amazing street food,lots of fantastic food esp the beef steak... good prices and too much of variety. it's packed almost every nite so make sure go there early around 7pm to avoid the queue...
A street of Korea beauty products,"This is the place you can find The Face shop, Missha, Etude House, Skin Food, Nature Republic and Innisfree etc. A must visit for tourist and you can see thousands of people walking the streets. There are also several major department stores in the area. It is located by it's station name Myeong-dong station and can be reach by Line 4.You may like to try visiting Seoul Global Culture & Tourism Center which is located on the 5th Floor of the M Plaza. Here you can register for a slot (they will inform you what time to be back) to put on the traditional Hanok costumes FOC."
Just so much!,"Overwhelming shopping experience from small stalls to large western shops, I would not say that there are bargins to be had in the large stores. Street food is there if you want to brave it, in general food quality is good, but don't expect to have a clue what you are eating!"
A great hive of shopping and food ,A fascinating experience wandering the streets in this area. It's a great big crisscross of shops and street stalls. Obviously a very popular shopping area for young people. 
The best market of Seoul,"The market is very touristy and vibrant.Full of street food,high end ,mid end retail showrooms . Those looking for cheaper goods can find on the street shopping carts.A must visit,while in Seoul even for 1-2 days."
Shopping Heaven!!!! ,"So many shops on sale! Seriously a shopping heaven for ladies mainly! Shopping ends up being addictive here at this market and we couldn't stop! When we left around 11pm, shops were all still open. "
Shopping Haven,"Grids of malls filled with cosmetic shops, streetwear labels, American food chains, and local food stalls catering for overseas tourists (written in English, Chinese and Japanese). We went on a Saturday but It was very comfortable and spacious despite the crowd. Shops were well layout although at times same shops were duplicated on different streets. You really need a full day there to find what you want but it's worth it. "
Wander round and try the street food,"As we were staying within Myeongdong we couldn't help but walk through the shopping area every day in and out of the hotel. Was good to take in the busy atmosphere and we tried some street food a couple of times - tasty snacks and so cheap. If you're not staying in the area but in the city centre for other attractions it may be worth paying a visit, particularly if you're looking to buy cheap cosmetics, which the area is famous for."
"After the Nanta Show, go and enjoy some awesome snacks!","The street is buzzing with vendors and Chinese tourists, you'll hear ""ha chi"" a lot. Prices vary from 3000 to 5000 Won (3-5 USD), baked cheese skewers, super juicy meatballs, seafood, fresh juice - the best was lemonade made with korean cider (non-alcoholic). There's a subway station on Line 4 and plenty of taxis. An hour to walk around and have some really good food. "
Really enjoy here!,"Lots of shop to enjoy, cosmetics, clothes, and many more. There are also restaurants that you can enjoy your dining. Whenever you visit S.Korea, this is the place you can not miss!"
Any ladies shopping fantasy,The Myeongdong Shopping Street offers a plethora of any ladies' clothing fantasy. From quality to inexpensive items; this shopping district is a ladies dream come true.
Cosmetic heaven,"Youy girl could make you bankrupt in 60 minutes. Makeup, cosmetic, skincare etc with super cheap price. Don't miss dessert in this area. "
Too crowded and touristy,Myeongdong is way too touristy and crowded these days.You can find all the shops in this area in many many other areas around Seoul so I don't see anything special about this area anymore. It used to be a great place to come for shopping and eating but there isn't anything special that sticks out in my mind. Might be worth a quick visit to check the box but I would spend time elsewhere. 
A Shopping Paradise,Good food and shopping everywhere! Many things to buy...this is a place to come to. Things are not cheap but good quality. One could go window shopping too. It will always be a great place to shop for all and fancy. 
Can't miss this,"If Goto Mall is the place for clothes, then this is the place for cosmetics. What can be said about this that hasn't been said before. Fantastic place for cosmetics. Lots of different brands and lots of shops selling same brands. Hence we see diversity of choices. Lots of samples for those willing buyers. In the evening, lots of street food. Not cheap but really good and delicious. There are also a few spectacles shops too. One can't miss them. Apparently one can get good quality glasses at reasonable prices in Korea. This is a must go for another interested in skin care. Come in the late evening and stay on till dark. "
Shopping galore!,"Myeongdong is a super busy area. It consists of several blocks of shops and restaurants. All of the Korean skin care and cosmetic brands are represented here. Most of them entice people to visit their shops by giving out freebies and you get even more freebies depending on your purchases. They also have promotions and sales like buy 1 take 1 on stuff and additional discounts to make your shopping sweeter. International brands like zara, forever21, uniqlo, h&m have big stores here as well. There's also a Daiso here that basically covers all your needs at a very affordable price. What's also interesting about this area is that there are food carts selling all sorts of yummy korean food. So when you get hungry while shopping, you can rush to these food carts or drop by any of the many restaurants in the area."
Good shoppin place,Best of the brands are available and the roadside eateries and shopping also available. underground market is also available. for shopping a must visit
Crowded regardless of morning or night!,"From cosmetic, food to clothes, fashion and accessories. It's all here for you from morning to late night. Lots of restaurant selections also, you will never tired walking around the neighbourhood due to the liveliness."
Absolute must,"If you don't visit Myeongdong, you don't see the most important part of Seoul. Shops, shoppers, department stores, market, street food, restaurants, cornucopia, - you name it. This is the main place to buy cosmetics - and don't worry about the carriers - if you really get into it and get everything you like, they will throw in a free suitcase for you to carry your purchases. The best place to buy are smaller shops, because the amount of freebies they throw in is astonishing! Definitely try the freshly grilled octopus, and the eggbun - they are the must have! Another delicacy is the fresh vanilla ice cream with honeycomb in the freshly baked waffle. Then, there is more, but your ""gourmet"" experience will depend on the size of your stomach! Juices and fruits are expensive - a glass of freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice cost around 4000 KWR! A cup of strawberries- 3000 KWR. Personally, I'd just stick to cold bottled water, which is available everywhere and costs very little, and save my money for the authentic street food, and of course, cosmetics, cosmetics, cosmetics. Visit Lotte department store too! The place is a madhouses, but it's fun - although, I will review it separately - it is worth its own review for sure! "
Food and shopping,"Busy street, you'll enjoy all kind of shopping, also so many kind of food, drinks, snakes. You need more days to stay there."
Shopping at Myeongdong!,"For me and my friends, the main purpose of our Korea trip was to explore all the different Korean skincare and beauty brands in Myeongdong. Etude House, The Face Shop, The SAEM, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Banila, Nature Republic(my fave), Its Skin, Skin 79, you name it, they have it ( though I did not recall seeing Too Cool For School within the shopping street ). Most of the brands are quite generous with their free gifts/samples. Got 12 pieces of the Snail Mask as samples from The SAEM when I purchased about 50,000 KRW worth of products. Me and my friends had the same experience of being spoken to in Mandarin the moment we stepped into the shops. Some of the more polite Chinese sales staff would first ask you if you understand Mandarin before proceeding to speak in the language. However, majority of the sales staff would automatically speak to us in Mandarin with the assumption that since we are Asian( me and my friends are Singaporeans ), we would know the language. No complaints though because without the Chinese sales staff, we might have difficulty communicating with the Korean sales staff.The retail associate from some brands can be quite enthusiastic/pushy in getting you into the store. One sales staff really took my friend by the arm and tried to drag her into the store. There's also a sales staff from another brand who tried to persuade me to purchase an item even though I already told her I already just bought 2 quantities of the same item just a few days ago. Some of the sales staff from the other brands also kept following me around the shop even though I had made it clear I would prefer to browse around myself. Overall, I really enjoyed my shopping experience and would love to go back again next year!"
Lots of people,"If you don't like to be around a lot of tourist, then you're going to the wrong street. Lots of shopping but swarming with people. It's a one stop shopping for Korean stuff and food but be ready. Be careful for pick pocketers. Keep your belongings close to you. Most stores open late so don't go before 11 am "
Convenient but super crowded,"You get almost all of the skincare brands (with multiple shops), chained coffee shops and the ""must eat"" items at the food stalls. Both Lotte and Shinsegae department stores are at the different corners of the area, so it's super convenient. But they tend to get repetitive and the area gets really crowded at night and during weekend."
"Shopping, shopping and shopping","convenient and dynamic shopping area. from big malls, chain stores to local stores, you can buy almost everything here. most tax refund centres are in the area, which is great for travelers; even better, quite a number of shops do direct tax refund thus save you all the troubles."
Street food,"we visited this area almost everyday, as our hotel in this area, mostly the shop selling skincare product, the area will get busier in the afternoon, love their street food, this place never never been quite. u can get everything in here from good restaurant, bar, and shopping center. must visit when you are in town"
Shoppers Paradise,"Truly a shopping haven...from clothes,shoes and cosmetics. Even if you dont intend to shop, the probability of going home empty handed is nil. There are tour volunteers to guide you around. One day isnt enough though."
Love love this place !,"We really enjoyed going to Myeongdong Shopping street which is just across our hotel The Pacific Hotel. There is a lot of action here, lots of tourists, lots of street food and of course lots of shopping. When in Korea, this is a place that you shouldn't miss."
Shop,"What to say about this place, so beautiful. Its my first visit to korea, as soon as i entered to this place i fell in love. So vast place massive buildings, people everywhere. This is the place where you will see most of the foreigners. There is too many beauty shops (which i dont need). You can find every thing in this place. One of the favourite place in soeul. "
Busy shopping street,Great shopping for skincare and accessories. Food and restaurant everywhere. Woman place and Line store with big bear also located here. Don't miss it when you visit Korea. It is a typical place to visit in Korea.
Mad house on weekend nights,"Bring lots of ones and fives, because you will need it for the street food. But you might want to spend just 10 minutes at the tourist info shop if this is your first time."
Food STREET place,"After having dinner in This STREET , Our GROUP started tO Explore This Myeongdong Shopping STREET Which is dominated by food street sellers , cosmetic shops, fashion shops and a few of shoes shop. A very interesting sights how the locals do enjoy very much their wide variety of foods , some is selling also Japanese sushi , grilled meats in varied forms, fresh fruits , pomegranate juice which is I found too expensive the price for a small glass of pomegranate juice KRW 5k. Just enjoyed the vibrant life of the city and their after office hour life is very interesting. I do recommend to spend one night here where you may enjoy the NANTA show theater."
All Day-Night Long Shopping & Eating,"A must visit if you travel to Seoul. The place was famous for middle range branded shopping such as Zara and H&M. There's a lot of cosmetics shops and sport store like Nike. So it's fun to spend the whole evening shopping and enjoy the also famous street food. There's ice cream, sausages, eggbread, and various fruits. If you don't feel to have street foods, there's also lots of restaurants. Lastly clothes and souvenirs also available here."
Great shopping,"It's like an outdoor mall... with great street food. One can spend hours browsing through the variety of cosmetic, nic nack and branded stores."
Great place for cosmetics shopping. ,It's a home of all cosmetic shops in South Korea. You can also try street food here. For street food you need to come in the evening when the vender start yo set up their food stands.
WOW,"dont miss, please look for guys with red cowboy hats that help you orientate in the city. Cosmetics EVERYWHERE. they have local food stalls at night. open very late"
Great shopping,"Great place to shop and eat at the places locals love. So many great shops and places to eat. I would recommend a half day, go at lunch and spend the rest of the time shipping"
Everything can be found here,"The de facto area to shop for cosmetics and beauty products. However, the selection of restaurants and food that can be found here is amazing. If you only have one area to visit and want to try all types of Korean delicacies, this is the area. Moreover, in the evening till night, the streets are lined with streeet stalls selling street food to fashion wares. Shopping can also be done in this area if you don't have time to head to other popular tourist areas. Almost everything popular in Korea can be found here. "
shoppers paradise!,"We happened to pick a hotel right in the heart of this area, it's a real shoppers paradise, you can get everything here from cosmetics through to fake designer goods, lots of extra stalls go up in the evening."
The place to visit if you're a tourist,"What else you could ask for from this shopping area which has everything starting with the famous Nanta Theatre w/ Cookin Nanta still performing after years and years...There are streets full of food vendor with all Korean street food that you're looking forAll Korean fashion chain store brand as well as cosmetic are here There's also the Line Store, restaurants that it took me 3 days to explore the whole shopping area"
Crazy Neon magic,"Great place for shopping and street food at night. The place absolutely buzzes with music, hawkers selling their wares and Seoulites enjoying the shops."
"Best shopping district for skincare products, money exchange and food","This is a very convenient all-in-one shopping district area for tourists, popular for a reason. Great during the day as well as at night, lots of food stalls as well as restaurants (and due to high number of tourists, it's one of the areas you can depend on to find english menus). Money exchange is quick and easy, I google searched for money exchange information for this area and came upon one or two very informative step by step blogs with directional guides of how to get to them with photos for references which was very helpful (unfortunately I am not allowed to put the URLs here but you can google and see for yourself). It was in this area that we visited the lovely Cat's Playground cat cafe as well, which was loads of fun."
street food and shopping everywhere!,"go for food experience mostly, you can shop, but everything is made in China, and sellers are chinese also, go by 6-7 pm, by 11 pm all closing"
Buzzing at night,Visiting the food stalls of Myeondong and savouring the variety of street food was a highlight of our trip to Seoul. We tasted many different and delicious meals. 
Cosmetic world ,"This street located in myeongdong area. Who looking for cosmetic and beauty products never miss this area like etude house and skin food and another else. Also a lot of another shopping and mall around this place for clothes, shoes, and food In the night it's open small capon in the area for another products with far price All the the time it's crowd until 11 pm"
Best place for your lady and her friends!,"Myeongdong street is famous for its stretches of beauty products store. You will see many promoters outside luring you into their store to purchase beauty products. Many good restaurants are also around. Pushcarts appear later in the night after 10pm that sells food, accessories, clothes etc. these may be cheaper than the normal stores you shop at in the day. "
Must visit!,Amazing shopping street! Ladies will go crazy with so many Korean cosmetic shops. Time to stock up on the Korean facial masks! There are many Korean restaurants here where you can try delicious Korean food like ginseng chicken soup and seafood pancake. Lovely!
Shop till you Drop!!!,"Want to shop? Here is the place to do so! First thing first, find the information centre which is near the bank or they station people in red with the 'i' icon, ask them for a map of the place. Plot where you want to go and shop!!! Buy more gives you more tax rebates so you can ask your friends to tag along too!!!Other thing we loved was the street food, from honey coated twisted potatoes to strawberry mochi. The street food selection was better than the ones along Yeouido Park!!!"
Good shopping area,"Even though it was rainy when we got Myeongdong, we had such a good time to visit many Korean beauty stores and do some shopping! Happy place for shopping lovers, especially the one who want to buy Korean beauty products."
Paradise for shopping ,"You can buy almost 90% things on your buying list in this area as I comprises big shopping mall and hawkers. You can start your buying from 10 am to 11 pm. Tips is that you have to shop at mall first as most of them close at 8 - 10 PM while you can continue shop at hawkers after that.One more tips for shopping, please do see more shop as the price difference is big in different street, in my case, select those old style and shops not in the Main Street are cheaper, different can be more than 30% ! "
Great place to browse for hours,"Many stalls by the roadside and shops with bargains to be found. Everything is available DVD, clothes, watches, bags etc.."
A Cosmetic Heaven,"Myeongdong is one of the place that you can get your Korean cosmetic product, by o mean you can still get it at other place but Myeongdong has most of the store which easily to grab. It was really crowded during Friday and every stalls try to sell their product. You will see more than 2 Skin Food or Etude House store. This place similar to Causeway Bay in Hong Kong but bigger and crowded with a lot of people carry big luggage to shop. A lot of restaurant and street food vendor as well so if you like to shop and eat at the same time, Myeongdong is the perfect place for you. We stopped by here almost 4-5 times because it was nearby our hotel so better come early in the morning to shop before it gets crowded."
The absolute best South Korean street market!,"I normally don't review this way, but I have to hand it to the Koreans that their street market is amongst the best I have ever visited. It's impossible to make your way through the whole thing in one visit unless you make an entire day out of it.. But you really could.. The best street food from sweet bread with eggs over easy to cheese bbq on sticks with honey drizzle.. Everything I put in my mouth was better than the last. Don't forget the mile high ice creams along the walk.. Plenty of souvenir shops and even places where you can dunk your feet to have little fish eat off the callouses.. It's everything you could ever want in a street market and more!!! A+"
Repetitive shops,I was told this is the place to go for the young and trendy but the shops are very repetitive. Tho I found the Line specialty boutique to be quite interesting.

Shopping Paradise,"It definitely is a great place for shopping because you'll find all famous Korean brands here. There are a lot of beauty/cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Missha, Holika Holika, Aritaum, Primera, etc. Most shop assistants know Mandarin. There's also the LINE flagship store with all the cute products of line characters. In mid-May it was not too crowded, so it was a nice shopping experience."
It's ALIVE!!!!!! ,"Lively and vibrant place. Alive, busy, and bustling at night. You can find so many shops in Myeongdong. From food to fashion to cosmetics - it's a place to be for shopping and dining. You must visit this place!"
Fun Neighbour Hood and Great Shopping,"My husband was recently on a business trip where I was lucky enough to tag along and enjoy a wonderful holiday in a country I have never had the pleasure of visiting before.This was one of the places where husband and I shopped. This whole area is a long strip of all kinds of retail stores and malls. It is a day long trip or a few trips to get the entire taste of the place. The best part of the area is the street food. I recommend to try everything out. Enjoying delicious street food is a birth right for Koreans and is taken very seriously. Everyrhing I have had is delicious and my husband and I have tried it all. Cheap, delicious food for snacks! There are food courts in the malls as well. And they are all worth a visit. Shopping and excellent food all in one wonderful place, what more can one need! "
Beauty heaven,"A place that one cannot miss it for beauty freak.. You are able to grab any beauty products on any of the streets. There might be 3-5 outlets of each brand around the vicinity. Different type of foods can be found too... Vibrant night shopping area!!! Never-ending crowds!! If you gonna purchase a lot of beauty products, best to stay around the vicinity. "
Cosmetics paradise,"Really love this shopping area, crowded all the time. You can find many brand of cosmetics such as innisfree, laneige, missha, holika holika, etude house, nature republic etc. There are many food stalls along the streets, selling strawberry, fish shaped cone ice cream, topoyaki, deep fried milk and many more. Most of the streets (myeongdong 1, myeongdong 2) have the same outlets, so in 1 area of myeongdong you can find 3 or 4 etude house. For tourist, minimum purchase of KRW 30,000, can claim tax refund at airport (ask the outlet staff to print the tax refund receipt)."
You can walk these streets for HOURS AND HOURS!,"If you love the hustle and bustle of Asian cities... Myeongdong has everything! Great Night life, great street atmosphere, especially the street food, great markets and shopping malls and of course great restaurants and bars..... I never ever got tired of wandering around Myeongdong!"
Brands & Tourist Galore,Every brand you can possibly think of are there... Including every other tourist are there. Lots to see and shop ( very competitive prices & promotions). Not a place if you dislike jostling and fast shopping.
Best place for cosmetic and food!!!,Myeongdong has everything (cosmetic) you want here. Cosmetic shop basically selling the same thing with same price every where in korea but you can get lots of free gift here in myeongdong. The restaurants here have lots of choice as well. From typical street food till high end korean bbq. Must visit !!
Shop shop shop,So many to shop in Myeongdong. Last time we stayed somewhere else and have to carry all the purchased good back to hotel by metro. This time we stay at Myeongdong and do all the shopping and city tax refund with few steps from hotel.
interesting shopping centre,"you can find lots of different shops and restaurant here. walk in street and buy clothes, cosmetics, shoes and bags."
For shopping addict,"For people who like shopping a must go, for other just a must see...incredible Korean style of shops. Just crowded and noisy, unbelievable how many cosmetic shops are found there"
AMAZING SHOPPING DISTRICT,"I personally prefer myeongdong shopping over dong dae mun.Lots to see, eat and shop! Extremely lively and fun.Loved all the street food! Highly recommended. GO AT NIGHT! 11pm++ Opens till 4am."
Shopping Haven,Went to Myeongdong one night with my family. Shopping is not enough for one night as we went back the following night. My teenage daughters were very excited with the cosmetic purchases they made. Street food is available and satisfying. Myeongdong Cathedral is also within the vicinity. Aside from cosmetics many things are also on sale. Restaurants are also within the area.
Busy and bustling ,"There is so much going on in Myeongdong that sometimes it's hard to pay attention. Tons of shops, restaurants and things to see. Pretty noisy, with all the music, people in the streets hawking their wares, etc. It's a great place to explore, but crowded all the time!"
awesome night market,Came here at night for a taste of local street foods. My tour guide showed me this place. It was very crowded with local people and was very fun. There were lots of food carts selling local delicacies at cheap prices. There were lots of mom and pop shops selling all sorts of things at prices cheaper than at retail stores. I highly recommend this place at anytime of the day.Tip: try the hot dog wieners dipped with assorted flavoring. DELICIOUS!!! My favorite was the garlic and corn.
"So much to see, shop and eat...","This place is so happening... So much of shops selling cosmetics, bags, food and fun things... The cosmetic shops have repetition in different area so in order to get customers they give away free masks. So after going into a few shops, even without buying anything, you will be able to bring home various type of face mask to try. You can always buy later after you try la, haha... A few must try street food are banana fritters in chocolate dipping sauce, egg cake and stir fried glass noodle. During office hour we can visit the cultural center to try out Hanbook and take some picture. There are also downtown tax refund for tourists here (2 banks) so you can safe time later in airport."
Variety of choices.,One good thing about the hotel we stayed in was it's proximity to the street. A women's paradise for skincare products. Variety of street stalls offering a countless number of different foods. 
Lively spot,It is very lively place with loud music from the malls. Not much comestic free gifts that I get though as a lot of people describing how generous the this place would be. A great place for youngsters and some kosher food available here.
The best of Seoul,"I love Myeongdong!! What can I say.. the atmosphere, the food, clothes, peoples, shop etc...the perfect place.."
Definitely a MUST-GO PLACE in Seoul!,"If you love to try variety of local food or you like street-food and shopping at the same time, this is exactly the place that you shouldn't miss when visiting Seoul. For shoppers, you can get better price here compared to Dongdaemun (only for certain stuff). When it comes to food, Myeongdong is also a heaven, even Muslims can easily find HALAL foods in here. You will definitely have to go here for so many times because one time visit is not enough!"
Find anything you want in Myeongdong,"Big brand stores, no doubt, will be available here. But not only them, even more niche store like A-land also available here. many good restaurants are also available here. No wonder Myeongdong become one of most visited shopping centre area. "
Fun Place!,"Full of clothing, shoe, cosmetic shops, restaurants, street vendors and a theater. Look down the side streets as they have lots more shops etc. Very safe (police station at entrance), and has an English speaking church at the other end. "
Excellent Shopping Stop,"I love how the shops have so much of varieties and the quality are good. I mainly stopped by their snacks and street food booth. Cos their street food are very delicious. There are shoes, clothes, accessories and many more. However, since the quality are good, the price for some items are not cheap once I convert from ₩ to RM, esp the jumpers. Other items are still affordable though. But still, if you are looking to buy quality items and you hv set a budget for it, be very sure to stop by this area. Its filled with youngsters and its very happening. "
Main shopping area but be prepared to have lighter wallets,"Very colourful area, bright signages, and usually packed with people. Clothes are incredibly expensive in Seoul, which I found surprising. The designs are nice, and the materials are usually of good quality - but, OMG, prices are shocking. You could buy 4 shirts in Malaysia, or 2 in America for the price of one in Seoul. Imitation stuff is available in abundance on the street though, perhaps that is what most people recourse to buying. "
"Food, fashion, fun","The title description says it all. This place is open late and full of shopping, eating and drinking. "
Interesting Shopping Street with loads of cosmetics and food,"This is a MUST-COME place in Seoul, regardless whether you love shopping. For those who doesn't like crowd and touristy area, i suggest that it's still good to at least experience the real Seoul Shopping street once. For female travellers, you will be thrilled with all the cosmetics on display here and for foodies, you will be spoilt for choice! "
Myeongdong Shopping,"Comparing Myeongdong to Insadaong for a shopping district, I much preferred Insadong. Myeongdong has a very urban feel, like a downtown Manhattan. The activity is down the small side streets which at first intimidated me. I walked the perimeter and then decided to ""head in"". This area I really felt had a focus on the skincare industry (there are some known clothing brands here, too). There are about 5 major brands for the skincare products and each brand has about 10-12 stores here. It's a very competitive industry and every store is really trying to ""reel you in"" with freebies, samples, discounts, etc. I finally went to Nature Republic and had a good experience of buying some skin care products. I was nervous about buying liquids and having them taken at the airport, so out of curiosity, I checked Amazon, and they carry Nature Republic, from Korea, so if you see a product you want, you might be able to get it sent to your door via Amazon. Just FYI. It's a fun place to go and see, but it does have a more high energy, hectic feel to it."
Great shopping experience!,"Wondering around this area for 3 days. Lots of skin care products and very confusing. However, if you're looking for a good skin care with a great price this is the place to be. Walk around, windows shop prior to make your selection. Lots of discount available for the same item. Stay alert, don't get confuse with discount offered. Otherwise, you will end up with over purchase."
Good location for shopping for tourists and locals,This shopping street is full of individual shops offering different type of items and they even have street foods carts selling diiferent korean traditional foods. The street is very well organised and plenty of walking spaces. 
Excellent shopping place,"Lot of cosmetics, clothing, style items are being sold. Use your bargaining skills. The shopkeepers will like that. They too will smile and bargain. shopkeepers use the calculators to tell you the price, due to language barrier. No problem, do the same and use their calculator to tell them the price you are willing to pay.. n enjoy shopping."
Lively Street,"Have fun embracing the Korean culture, try the traditional almond cake and sometimes it's just good to get lost you always find hidden adventures."
Shopper's Paradise,"If you're into fashion and make up as well as food, this is the place to be. Better to go at night for the food street. "
Great Place for shopping,"we almost spent our entire seoul trip here. My wife enjoyed shopping here and you can have good side street food here. many malls like lotte young, avaneul are there. we watched one movie too here. Grate Place for shopping and entertainment."
Great shopping,"If you visit Seoul, you will most certainly visit Myeongdong. Lots of shops, although plenty of repeat cosmetic shops. There are lots of sports, clothes shops and plenty of F&B outlets.There are always a lot of tourists around the area and if it is your first time visiting, you might feel pretty stressed out by the immense activities all around. Duck into shops to get some relief from the crowd on the streets and take your time."
Cosmetic area,"people who wanna buy cosmetic made in korea, should come here. All is korean product. in the afternoon a lot snack (street market) they sell seafood grill, fruit,ice cream. that time i went there is a strawberry seasons, so yummy..try strawberry mochi."
Great,Fantastic place! It makes feel in a move. A lot of local shops and international brands. Get lost and if don't know the way back there are some guys to give you information. I really liked and enjoyed the place.
My favourite shopping place,"I loved this place, you will get lost along places and shopping brands, if you pass by a place that you want to check, please do it right away, forget about going back you will probable get lost because every street is similar to the other one."
Shops everywhere ,After visiting the N Seoul tower I ventured around Myeongdong. The underground shops at first look quite ordinary but led to an underground food heaven. The choice and quality of food was amazing. After eating lunch I went back up to the street level where there were food stalls everywhere and shops to suit all kinds of tastes. If you wander around long enough you will find back alleys that sell everything from clothes to souvenirs. A morning trip to the tower and the afternoon around the shops is a good way to spend the day.
Where you can find everything,"a good place to go as you can find everything you need, from shopping to eating. Multiple branches of same brands can be found for shoes, beauty care, apparel. Lots of restaurants as well"
One of the most happening shopping district,"Had always enjoyed shopping in the Myeongdong area. There are lots of shops and restaurants available in the area.Pretty happening with lots of mascots walking around the area. This time round we are pretty lucky to chance upon shooting of a show at the Myeongdong Theatre. For a moment, we panicked as we see police, personnel in chemical warfare suit as well as ambulance, complete with a criminal being handcuffed. It was a welcome treat in a shopping district!"
Is a must visit to all visitor to Seoul,The best shopping + culinary + hangout district in all of Seoul.All kind of foods (restaurant and street vendors) and all kind of shopping available at this wonderfully wonderful wonderful Myeongdong. Feels like you are in a Korean Drama you've always admiring.... 
Who likes this?,"It was in the travel guide, and my Korean friends said it was worth a few hours, at least. Nah! It was way to crowded, and I'm pretty sure I caught some sort of virus there - either from being in excessively close proximity to millions of other travelers from dozens of other countries, who were all open-mouth coughing all over each other - or else my illness was brought on by my making the unfortunate decision to purchase some ""food"" of indeterminate origin from a street vendor. I don't wish to reinforce any negative stereotypes, but lets just say that meal didn't taste like any other protein I had ever eaten before (or since). After 90 minutes in this place, I was wiped out for days! Leave it off your itinerary, unless your somewhat suicidal."
My favourite street,I love the shopping street of Myeongdong i go there every evening just to enjoy the food and shopping
Cosmetics cosmetics,"If you like cosmetics, this is the place to go to. Every shop offers all kind of products for apparently good prices. For me this wasn't it..."
Great great place to feel Korean..,"Its just 5 mins walk from my hotel at President Hotel. This place will offer you everything. Theres mall, big mall, duty free, traditional market, traditional food and good ambience when you went out at night. You can shop any kind from the cheapest till expensive..you should visit Myengdong if you spend the time at Seoul.."
Fun,"When night fall, there is where the crowd build up. Nevertheless, if you enjoy shopping and eating, this is the place you should never miss out."
A must visit!,"Bustling with street vendors, street foods, selling everything Korean from mobile phone accessories to Korean beauty products, local Korean delicacies, never lack supply of caffeine from the coffee shops, clothing stores and much more! its alive at night and vibrant with shopping activities! Easy access from everywhere. Loads of accommodation nearby ranging from backpacking hostels to high end hotels! The choice is yours."
Shop eat repeat,This place is a heaven for shopaholics and makeup + skincare lovers. The prices of the makeup products and skincare products are reasonable. The street food were awesome as well. You should visit the cat cafe as well. We had a great time there. Visit this place after your visit to namsan tour.
Wow!,"Twice we visited this area, one for shopping, the second one for shopping and sampling all the incredible street food."
Love love korean beauty products,"Shopping shopping and more shopping of korean beauty products. Lots of big brands here and they have more or less 3-4 of same brand boutique stores like Laneige, tonymoly, missha, nature republic , etude house and more. Everywhere u go is about shopping . They also give free samples if u will just take a look inside their store.. But of course it entices u to shop and try their brand :-)I love the nature republic store. It is also in this his area that we found a very good korean bbq restaurant- hmmmm yummy the samgyeopsal... Just a block from Loisir hotel. I definitely want to be back here. 3 days isnt enough :-)"
fun,The street comes alive in the evening. It was fun just to try to guess what all the foods were. We snacked from various stands instead of going to a restaurant for dinner.
busy but many shops,"Very busy. You can buy many beauty items and fashion items. If you hungry, you can eat something at restaurant or food stands. There are many hotels near Myeongdong. "
Crazy shopping!!,It feels like you can spend a week there shopping and you still won't get enough!! If you prefer to shop quietly I suggest you to go in the morning. Most of the shops are open about 9-ish. If you want to try all the yummy street food then you should go after 6pm!! It's a crazy and wonderful adventure! 
Make-up and street food,"Make-up, street-food and tourists pretty much sums up Myeongdong. It's a popular shopping area for tourists so most of the staff in the stores speak English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. If you're looking for some place traditional, this is not the right place for you. The same shops are repeated several times and are mostly branded local and foreign products. "
Love the vibrance of the street vendor and the crowd ,Enjoy walking around and snacking on the variety of foods. Should go both in the day and night time as the ambience is a little bit different. 
"Whatever you are looking for, they have it","Myeongdong is the place to go shopping and when you are tired, just eat at one of the many resturants! There are a lot of good places to dine here, if you know what you are looking for. And there's plenty of street food to try if you want to go more local. As usual, take the opportunity to stock up on cosmetics here as there are plenty to buy!"
Never come here in the weekend,Many international brands and famous Korean brands stores located here. You may see the same cosmetics brand has 3 retail stores or even more located here. I don't really suggest ladies to do your cosmetics shopping in Myeongdong because the shops here are much more busier and some hot-selling items may run out-of-stick. Why not go to ehwa university street for your cosmetics shopping? You will have much more space to shop there and you don't need to squeeze with other visitors. You may even get more samples there!
Happening at night,Its was happening! Do go at night.. but the market ready to close around 11pm..Lots of lots of make up brand u will see there.. dont forget to ask for free give.. :)
Fun shopping,"This area is rival to any working garment district. Los Angeles has a smiling district offering everything from fabric to clothing and shoes. Sizes are limited but the clothing is well made and up to date. The merchandise is in abundance and prices vary. This can be an all day event, but go early since the wholesale markets close at noon."
"Awesome shopping, great buzz at night","Myeongdong has everything you want. It's a girl's heaven of course since half the stores here sell skincare and cosmetics and they always pile you with free samples to take home, with or without a purchase. Even my spouse is happy here as they have cd stores and there's always a skincare range for men. You can also find lots of boutiques selling clothes, from Korean brands like SPAO to edgier multi-brand stores like ALAND. In short, there's a good range of cheap to mid-range shopping here. There are plenty of cafes to fill your cravings for good coffee, desserts and waffles and restaurants serving anything from Korean, to Japanese to Chinese food. Thetre's a also short street that is lined with Korean fried chicken restaurants - how awesome is that?! I have been here multiple times and never get tired of this place. Oh, and I always choose to stay here every time I'm in Seoul. The buzz at night is awesome, especially with the night markets selling anything from street food to accessories. "
Best place to shop for cosmetics!!!,I live it here!! Most of the shops are opened till late 11.30pm.. there are so many promotions and if you are a korean cosmetic product junkie then this place is heaven for you! A good tip is to really decide which product or brands you're looking for... because each brand have a few shops just here... so when you're here take a look around first. Check their promotions as each shop have different promotions even though they are the same brand. And i love it when you purchase any cosmetic product you'll get free gifts... the more you buy the more you get so decide wisely! And there's also clothing shops here... korean local very good quality brands clothing and very fashionable too... ranges from expensive to affordable... just google the brands and styles which suits yours and get the Myeong-dong shops map so its easier for you to locate any shops you're looking for... for tourists there are also discount coupons we can download but i dont remember the site name... just google it and it will come out... hope my review helped! 
Just ok for me,"We arrived around 5p and the food street vendors were just arriving and setting up, we bought snacks from grilled squid and octopus to fried noodles, egg bread and crepes, kind of korean tapas, it was amazing and very tasty. The shops were just ok."
A paradise for girls!,"Endless Korean beauty brands in this area, super busy and crowded but I liked it. The street food was amazing as well, so many variety and I wish I have the stomach to eat everything :)"
Seriuosly CRazy bout the Banana Crepe,There is a lot of food stall if you happn to be there not during rainy day.I repeat the same place during my second night just to try their street food and it was awesome.
Busy at night ,Really busy and exciting at night lots of street food vendors and hats and sock vendors for some reason.
Incredibly crowded shopping area,"Myeongdong shopping street was great for shopping and the food stands! The area is always packed with people so there isn't really a ""best"" time to go to avoid crowds. There are a huge amount of stores selling clothes and beauty products so you can never run out of options. The staff in the stores follow you around and stick to you until you leave, which can get quite frustrating for those who enjoy shopping in peace and asking for help only when needed."
"Shop, eat, shop","Interspersed with the main retail chains like Zara, Uniglo, you will find lots and lots of small shops selling masks, make up, skin care. On every street, left and right you will be surronded. After a while, all masks look the same. Local branded makeup and skincare shops are on every block and corner. In between are the cafes, there are at least 4 Starbucks within the area, lots of eateries where you can rest your feet. Despite the crowd, its clean. Within walking distance is the Namdaemun market. If you only wish to visit shop in Seoul, this would be the place to be."
Oh the street food,"Lots of shopping, and the food....I miss it already. Great just to walk around and browse. Did I mention all the great street food vendors......delicious"
Let's face it . . . Asia's Cosmetics Mecca!,"This shopping district is home to all of the cosmetic brands that Asian women--and Asian metrosexuals--respect and revere. In addition, there is a decent-sized Daiso, one of the famed Japan-based ""dollar store"" chains, in the area. The UNIQLO, a Japanese GAP, is also purported to be the biggest in South Korea.Many of the store chains offer 2-for-1 deals, allowing a customer to take home double the amount, for the original purchase. But mind you, prices aren't cheap. Cosmetic masks seem all the rage, as of Spring 2016.Competition is tight, so sales clerks hover, as soon as one enters any store. They obviously work on commission, as they try not only to show one a variety of goods, but also to upsell.An interesting place not only for shopping, but also for people watching. There are numerous concrete cubes along the main pedestrian thoroughfare, where one can watch the world go by."
Shopping and relax,"Though it is a very crowded city, I really found it relaxing, you can walk a lot while you shop or simply see at all the nice (and not expensive) things they sale in the street. You can find street food (I didn't try it but some of it looked ok, specially the sweets). Here you can find stores you have at home (like Zara) but the main attraction I would say is street stores with a lot of cute socks and souvenirs. "
Plethora of beauty products to choose from!,"For those beauty product aficionados, shopping here will be definitely to your heart's content. This encompasses a lot of subway stations and will really take you a day to stroll! It is also a haven for Hello Kitty enthusiasts, for the Hello Kitty cafe is also located here!"
CROWDED BUT AWESOME,This place is like Orchard road in Singapore but extremely crowded especially on weekends. You can find whatever you wanna find here although I would not recommend as Singapore already has everything you wanna find if you are from Singapore. The high end items are not even cheap to begin with. However you can find lots of street food if you wanna try their street food. 
Beauty and Wellness Shops Abundant!,"Myeongdong is full of Korean brand shops selling beauty and wellness products and they will give you samples just to pull you into their store and maybe get you to buy some of their products, but they also won't seem upset should you not buy any. However small the purchase, they will throw in some samples of other products for you to try."
Vibrant and great street food,"Good for a western style shopping experience and dinner. Bustling, vibrant and varied. A wide selection of restaurants to visit in the vicinity too."
Fun Shopping at Night!,"The Myeongdong Shopping District is big and well organized, whether you want to do shopping in the street, where I found the best deals for bag-packs or within the Department stores, with an incredible selection and trends but where you'll pay more. There are also some underground shops worth visiting below the main streets. Take your time and compare items as very often you'll find the same at several locations but not necessarily priced as much! You can also negotiate with the street vendors and usually get the best deal when you say NO and sort of walk away. You'll get the price you are willing to pay! We had the best Korean meal within the Lotte Department Store all the way to the top where it's garnished with a food concourse and several restaurants. There is also a street stage with non verbal choreographic performances of local pop music which is fun to watch!"
"""excellent place for cosmetics-shopping""","After Visiting Myeongdong Cathedral, cousins and I just couldn't helped ourselves shopping for cosmetics! "
So awesome,There is so many shops and sooo much street food!!! Do not miss out on myeongdong!Tons of cosmetics and clothing! Don't forget the underground mall
Must visit!,"Crowded street with great varieties of beauty products, cafe, restaurants and etc. Must visit place when you r in Seoul, especially ladies."
A good place to buy skincare products,There are so many Korean brands of skincares at one place beside the international big names and clothing giants like H&M and Zara. Street market open at night too.
Shopping Haven,Prices have been sky-rocketed since we were here in 2012. Overall still a decent place to go shopping for cosmetics and street snacks. Plenty of people making it quite hard to manoeuvre around the streets.
Food&Shopping + Best Money Exchange,"Myeongdong is a busy area, full of fashion store, different shops, cosmetic brands and small restaurants, coffee shops and street food. As a plus if you are searching for money exchange, Myeongdong has probably the best exchange rates."
Feel the vibe and food..,"Good for (cosmetic) shopping, but we liked its vibe and especially the street food. There are many restaurants nearby where you could taste the local food as well. It could be very crowded though.."
All about beauty,"Myeongdong area is complete for fulfilling your cosmetics, skin care, make up needs. Along the street you can see several brands. They usually offer free samples however the sample is for you if you buy something. "
Terrific Shopping,"Stayed at a hotel on the heart of this area, the joint jumps well into the night.Great selection of street food, restaurants, and shops selling all things fashion."
"Street food, fast fashion shops and lots of people","Noisy street day and night where you can find amazing traditional Korean street food such as grilled octopus, some crab things, fish and sweets. Prices vary, some are highly unreasonable but food is just beyond imagination."
Bustling market,"I love the street food here, there is just so much variety. The market is full of cosmetic and retail shops and there are even cafés hidden in the alleys. It can get crowded but it's all worth going to."
The Place for Make Up shopping,"This is the place for you to buy your make up! They offer a lot of discounts and free samples. You could also find clothing and foods here, but really you could not missed the make up stores."
Crowded every way you go. ,"The place is so crowded with shoppers, strollers or just passing by people from all walks of life! You'll find anything you want here with so much street foods of all sort! Nearby is the big Lotte Super shop where good bargains and tax free merchandise for tourists.The best place for shopaholic!"
looks like jakarta pasar baru,things actualy not.to.cheap u must have a very good skill for negothen u can got the cheap prizebut the street food is sooo tempting
"Great city vibes, unleashed the closet shopaholic in me!","There's something about Myeongdong that I find irresistible.2nd time here and would still find myself spending hours roaming the streets!First time we came, we had an unforgettable mud spa experience. This time, I'm back with a group of foodies, so we sought out a famous abalone porridge restaurant and a gyoza place.Skincare products loading is granted, but the prices for Brands like Laneige has gone up substantially compared to 3 years ago. "
Great shopping,Great shopping for souvenirs and skin care. It is right by the subway so it is easy to get to and make sure to try the street food which was delicious. 
A place for people watching,"It's not really the mecca of shopping as only mostly cosmetics and clothing are sold here. I wouldn't call it a food paradise either because I can find better eateries in Insadong. But it's certainly a magnet for the younger crowd, especially at night. This area comes alive after 7pm. Street food (mind you, they are not 'cheap', starting from 2,000 won for a tiny bun) abounds and you will be tempted to try everything! Stand along the shops and watch people pass by. It's filled with tourists!"
Only for shoppers,"The place is crowded, not for people who wants nice and quiet. But you get your clothes and accessories from there."
Shopping Haven,Best place to shop for Korean cosmetic products. Especially face masks. All the big brands are here. Visit in the evenings to enjoy the street food while shopping. 2 thumbs up! 
Nice hustle-bustle,This place is full of street food and cosmetic shops. I loved the hustle-bustle. My wife loved shopping for cosmetics. They have a free public wifi in many places. 
THE Place for Shopping in Seoul,"This is the market, with many 24-hour outlets for shopping of cosmetics. Probably the busiest shopping area of Seoul."
bring lots of cash,"Shopping and skincare heaven, take your time to look around before buying. Crowded at any time of the day, the street really comes alive at night when the food carts are out. If you plan to stock up on your skincare or cosmetics, do your research as some shops provide instant tax refund now like the Laneige flagship store and Olive Young. Other than shopping, there are also plenty of restaurants and coffee shops for you to rest your feet. Visit the cat cafe while you are there to take a break from the crowd!"
High-end shopping area plus souvenirs.,Main street has high-end clothing and department stores. Side streets have more souvenirs. Skin care is a hot items in Seoul. Lots of places to buy face masks and foot masks. Inexpensive items for pampering your skin! 
Window Shopping,"During our brief 5-day trip to Seoul, we found the Myeongdong shopping street was perhaps the best past-of-time activity, especially at night where street food stalls abound with plenty of variety to choose.I can't say much about shopping aspect - we did our shopping spree at Lotte Department Store which was virtually next to our hotel. But Myeongdong Shopping Street is really only 5 minutes walking distance from our hotel so a great window shopping & street food sampling opportunity. "
Love it! Love the vibrance and energy. ,Great place to visit especially if you love the night life and bargaining as well as the endless rows of street food. Bring lots of cash. 
Shopping shopping shopping ,The best area for shopping or just walk around. Very recommend to arrive after 18:00 pm if you want to enjoy some food in one of the food stands. 
Hotspot for cosmetic lovers.,"The other name for this street is cosmo road, which itself explains the speciality of this street. You can see a wide range of cosmetics with all popular korean brand names lined up in one street.Even I, who has almost zero knowledge about cosmetics was mesmerized.Do not forget to buy Aloevera gel from Nature Republic.Also, do not overlook the street peddlars. You can find a very large variety of accessories with them which come very cheap. I went there on a day when the temperature was -12 degrees and the wind was blowing at 12 kmph speed but still the allure of the street peddlars was so good that I bought around 2 dozen earrings, each one costed 1000 korean won (approx. 60Rs in INR)And don't forget to buy those yummy cheese sticks which you will see being cooked on open clay stove there, and potato tornadoes (potatoes are cut and twisted around a stick in the shape of a tornado and deep-fried. You get to select the type of seasoning you want on it - plain salted, cheese and onion flavours are available)"
Visited night-time,"I went at night ~9.30pm local time, after visited Everland in the morning.The street was still busy with visitors, mostly tourist. I came here mostly for the cosmetic goods. Spotted Etude, Nature Republic, etc.. I end up spending a lot (blimey!) because the offer was too good. There were branded stores as well, and another plus is the street vendors, selling food. I'm going there again tomorrow to check out the souvenir part of the street and eating from the vendors. (it's so good, i just want to come again)To go there: Use Line 4 and stop at Myeongdong station, exit 6. Enjoy!"
"Skin Care, Shopping Heaven","OMG, in myeongdong is like skin care heaven for ladies. From the beginning of exit of subway to the end of streets is full of various and verity of skin care shop ( well, it's not only skin care shop, but department Store n shopping mall too, but my eye just focus on skin care shop). You won't be worry of your stomach as a long the streets hawkers selling streets food, and despite of that, it's clean."
Food extravaganza ,Food food food heaven. Very busy. Most vendors charge 3000 won per item. Lots of cosmetic shops. Fun place to visit. 
Fun area ,"I liked this area a lot, but I liked Insadong more for what I was looking for. Lots of skincare places in Myeongdong, and trendy universal stores."
Skin care heaven and street foods,"You don't have to walk too far to find a store of whichever Korean brand skincare product, they are just right there. Lots of offer 50% off or buy 1 get 1 free, so just work out exactly what you need so you don't overspend ( which is way to easy to happen). Don't buy face masks as your first item, you most probably will receive some freebies (lots of freebies possibly). Street foods are available more at night. There are KFC, Starbucks and Macca as well."
good shopping area,"go there to stock up on your skincare & cosmetics. heard that skincare & cosmetics used to be really cheap, but realised it is not that cheap afterall. do your research and see if you can buy it cheaper at your home country first. go there for their street food, you must try their honey pancake!"
Must visit when in Seoul!,"Good venue for shopping! From clothes, beauty products, food, to souvenirs. My friends like the bags the most!"
Good for shopping; mind the crowds...,I enjoyed wandering around this area. There are a few side alleys which bring you to interesting and different shops. However the proliferation of chain stores and tourist-friendly shops means that the interesting and eclectic will not last long. Catch it while you still can.
Best Place to have fun.,As I mention early in other review that I love seoul. Myeongdong shopping area is good go get every thing you want for fashion and makeup but for dresses I like nandemondon only 15 min walk... also there is many food stall try different kind of food .....I am going again on May so this time will stay in Meyongdon area.
Busy but fun,"I visited at night. This is the place to go for western clothes stores (forever 21, h&m, Zara) and Korean beauty products. Many salespeople speak English and Chinese because this area is so popular with tourists. You can also claim tax refunds on your purchase by showing your foreign passport at the tax refund counter. The area is extremely crowded and noisy but doesn't feel unsafe. Lots of street food and street market stalls too. "
Great for shopaholics and foodies....,"The price of food is a bit pricey considering its street food. Price ranges between 2000 won which equivalent to 2USD-5USD. But some of the food are unique, out of this world and yummy. You'll go there again and again so you can try all of them. I recommend the fruits especially their fresh strawberries (you can get it for 4000 won a box, 3000 won in a cup), crispy squid and shrimp is also a must try (5000 won), the egg muffin (2000 won) and the sausages(3000 won) a stick and other sweets like mochi and waffles and pancakes shaped like a fish.There's plenty of souvenir items as well and a wide range of cosmetic brands."
Best place to shop for cosmetic and skincare!,"Everytime I visit Korea, I have never failed to visit Myeondong. Reason being, there are so many street foods to try out and this a great place to shop for skincare and cosmetics! However, it seems like the crowd is getting more these days. For travallers who prefer less crowded places, you may consider going to Hapjeong or Dongdaemun. I strongly recommend first timer to Korea to visit here at least once! For pet lover, do drop by the cat cafe and dog cafe! "
"A place for shopaholics, foodies, trendsetters, and people that simply enjoy city life","Looking for cosmetic, clothing, food, dessert, drink, street food, or gadget? This huge shopping area has everything. Even though it is crowded, it is very clean and comfy. I think this place has the cleanest street food that I have ever seen. Here you can enjoy the true Seoul city hype."
Great,"Too many shop and restaurants and had everything as you want, too many travelers and delicious foods. You must try all stalls food on that street"
Great shopping street that has it all!,"We loved shopping here! We were amazed at the number of stores. There are stores for just about everything: shoes, clothes, and of course skin care! Our favorites were Innisfree, The Face Shop, Skin Foods, Nature Republic, Tony Moly, Etude House, and Missha. And they each had multiple locations within this shopping district. The staff speak some English and were very helpful in recommending products to treat a variety of problems. The most popular items were the sheet face masks and some stores even gave some out as free samples. There are deals to be had at many stores and even among the street vendors. The food vendors sell an assortment of eats including octopus, squid, chicken skewers, tornado potatoes, lemonade, cotton candy, orange juice and others. Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and KFC are present along with many other Korean and foreign restaurants. There are also vendors selling accessories, jewelry boxes, t-shirts and souvenirs. "
Great place to shop and eat,You can get all kinds of stuff there... although is full of people but is a great place to explore..
Myongdong,"There ar elots of people and stores.For woman, cause there are lots of coemetic brand store,so you can buy k beauty products. But if u like to see nature,it is not appropriate."
"Excellent view over the area , almost up to North Korea",You can walk up from the area of the Seoul central station . It might take you 30 minutes to reach the ground floor of the tower and then book your elevator ticket . If you are there in April then The way will be surrounded by nice blossoming sherry trees .
"Seoul's big brand shopping hub, bustling with tourists","If you're visiting South Korea and you want to do some premium shopping, this is the place. Packed with people, mostly tourists, on weekends and weekdays. You can find all the big brands in Myeongdong, as well as street vendors selling cute,cheap goods. If you want good deals, and more elbow room, ask the locals for alternatives. Lots of interesting street food to try as well."
Fun place to kill time,I caught the subway to Myeongdong. The shopping streets are all connected in this area. Many restaurants offering Korean dishes of all types. A lot of delicious street food.
Love it! ,Endless shopping and never ending street food stalls. A great place for buying various brands and type of beauty products. Line Friends store is a hit too as many people take a chance at photographing the huge Line bear. 
Great street food,"If you are ever at Myeongdong, you have to walk around for shopping and the street food. We ate dinner at a restaurant but could not stop to eat street food"
Action starts at 6pm,We where there around 5pm and lot of different shops located there. The true actions starts 6pm when electric power wagons starts to flow to scene and in now time the evening market is crowed of people. 
Interesting even for non-shoppers,"The shop quality is mixed with some big international retailers and also more local stores. It is very busy and therefore good for people watching and soaking in the busy atmosphere. There is a huge predominance of facial/skincare shops which is very different to other western countries, and apparently is much more engrained in Korean culture. There are however many many coffee shops like starbucks, holly coffee, paris baguette etc which become very invasive and you can't get away from."
Shopping heaven,"Loved this street and went back many times during my week in Seoul. If you love cosmetics, this will be heaven to you. I think every major Korean cosmetic brand was covered here - my favourite being Innisfree which seemed to have a store every 100m. We had dinner here and also watched the latest James Bond film, so it isn't all about shopping."
Must see in Seoul,"The people on the street were very helpful- including guides to help you find your way around the city. Plenty of shopping, although not as inexpensive as other asian markets. Clean city and feels safe, definitely a must see. Plenty of street entertainment."
Its time for street food hunting..,"Visit this street at night,there is alot of street food here..if you want to enjoy seoul at night this is the right place..."
Highly recommended,Whether its for food...fine dining....weird menus...best of shopping or the local food experience...it is the place to be...you have to prepare yourself and your videocam cause you will see the weirdest yummiest food in the making ...traditional korean sweets and traditional food can be bought from here...im positive you will visit this place more than once
"good healthy delicious Korean food - street food, noodles - all good! Except for bad experience with Forever 21 :(","Thursday to Saturday night teeming with tourists, lots of people. Sunday is jampacked, eating places are blockbusters. "
Shop 'til you drop!,There were tons of stores and carts selling anything you could want. I would recommend walking around a little before buying anything though because a lot of things are sold at various places with no price regulation so you may find it for cheaper...aside from stores prices are usually negotiable. Easy access to subway system and buses.
Shopping galore ,"If you are a shopper, this is your street. From fashion to cosmetics, you name it, they have it. After a day of shopping, enjoy the street food which comes on at around 6.30 pm. Take your pick! "
Bargains galore ,Never boring... with everything you need. I love to search the streets and alleys here for great Korean products. A must visit area when in Seoul if you love food and shopping. 
Shop till you drop,Heaven for those who likes shopping. The streets are lined with various items for sale and a wide variety of street food. The crowd even makes your shopping experience in Myeongdong a very enjoyable one. 
Shop til you drop,"From trendy boutiques, to chain shops, and cheap stores, there is something for everyone. Myeongdong is also a Streetfood haven. Very touristy though. "
Shopping Paradise,"Any leisure trip to Seoul will not be complete without a stopover in Myeongdong. Even a repeat visitor to Seoul who does not shop will make it a point to drop by Myeongdong if only to feel its pulse and find something to eat. For shopaholics, Myeongdong is the highlight of any trip to Seoul, every time. International brands, new to market products, be they cosmetics/skincare, apparel or accessories, Myeongdong has them all. Cafes, restaurants and mobile food carts catering to every palate and pocket, you'll find them all on the streets and alleys of Myeongdong. In short, Myeongdong = Eat. Shop. Repeat. If one runs out cash in Myeongdong, there is always a bank or ATM somewhere. You can even get your VAT refunds instore in Myeongdong, and spend all your refund amounts again at the same place. The serious shopper will strive to get most of his/her shopping in Myeongdong done before 5pm or 6pm on weekdays. It will be a challenge to shop in Myeongdong on weekends and in the evenings when young Seoulites join the tourist crowd to shop up a storm in the city's shopping mecca. There are countless cafes of every genre to retreat to if one needs a respite after the footwork. Any visitor to Seoul who tires of Myeongdong is tired of shopping. Those who manage to book rooms in hotels at or near Myeongdong, can deposit their roundtrpĺ"
A must for ladies!,"If you are into Korean skin care and cosmetics, then this is the place to be! However, if you want lots of skin care and cosmetic samples, then go to less busy districts in Seoul with better service and more freebies.However, as a visitor, it is worth visiting Myeongdong as there are loads of street vendors selling delicious korean goodies, snacks and juices.....something I always look forward to when I'm in Korea. There are lots of small and medium sized cafes and restaurants on the side streets for a bite to eat after a long day of shopping and wandering."
"Shopping, shopping and shopping","Nothing much to say. Just shopping and shopping. Good for lady. Product from Korea is cheap here, cosmetic, fashion, souvenir.. all you can get here. That's also lots of shop selling local food and tibits.The only draw back was, not everybody speaks English. So we encountered some language barrier. Sign language still the universal language"
Overrated and boring!,"the street is lined with shops that can be found everywhere else in Seoul so why do you have to go to Myeongdong specifically? Things get sold out faster too due to the influx of people, not to mention crowded. I am female and I got bored in less than an hour, go figure.Check out this quaint congee place near the tip of the main shopping strip (opposite of the Shinsegae end) though, it's good! 3rd Floor."
Seoul Landmark!,"Very convenience location, direct subway will bring you right to Myeongdong Subway Station, exit 8 will bring you up to the famous Myeongdong Shopping Street.This street also called 'Cosmetic Street' because of many shops selling facial cosmetic products. It is also a street, many people will go for minor facial cosmetic surgery. Not a surprise to see people walking around with face wrapped with bandage after surgery. Myeongdong Shopping Street is also a good place to get freebies, shop vendor will generously give out free facial mask, lotion, skin care product and many samples to visitor. If you purchased products from the shop, you will also get more free sample & they will offer to post your goods back to your country with no delivery charge.If you want to look for food, no doubt this is a great stop too for varieties of choice. You may want to allocated a whole day shopping here if you are into cloths, skin care product & food."
Shopping Hub for Tourists,Bustlng with energy. Shoppers and foodies' hub. Can get crowded in most days as most tourist and locals flock to this place. Street can get clogged with the surge of people especially in the afternoon when the strrets get occupied by different food carts and retail merchandize. 
Fun,"Lots of shopping to do, many restaurants and street food to choose from and a lot of entertainment (people dancing, people watching, live music, etc). "
"Seems to be busy all the time, but great buzz!","For the shopaholic, it's paradise. Designer stores aplenty, with a phenomenal range of food outlets and restaurants. The street stalls are a must see, and the local food available from them can't be missed. Shop prices were disappointingly similar (if not more expensive) than Europe, but there is literally nothing that you can't find. It's an experience!"
24 hours bustling area,"I stayed closely, so I could pass through this area at different times. It was always packed, full of interesting places for visitors: restaurants (you should try those on second and third floors!), street food, and shops, lots of shops, that close quite late in the evening (10 pm)"
Shopaholics and Brand Chasers dream chi ching! $$$,"A nice place to walk around. Even better if you have lots of spare cash as the things I could see were not cheap. Don't let you wife loose here with your credit card, or husband, partner. Good photos to be taken of the street."
Good for shopping and delicious meal ,"Our hotel's close to Myong dong so we walk back and forward the street a lot. The street's perfect for cosmetic shopping and eating out. Tried Beef BBQ and Kimchi soup here and will never feel regret. One dinner for three cost around 100,000 KRW "
Shopper's Paradise,I went crazy shopping here. This place has endless good stuff. It even has a few halal Street food shops. 
Take your time,With so many shops to choose from you'll need to walk through once to decide what to buy where. Fun.
Great Shopping Area,"If you are shopping for cosmetics, this is the place to be! They also sell a variety of items from trinkets to delicious food. A must for shopping!"
Shopping shopping and more shopping,A lot of things to see and buy! There are many shops which offer sales and bargains. Street food here is a must try!
Incredible!,I'm not a shopper but I loved the vibrant atmosphere and the food being prepared by the street vendors. I visited a dog cafe and a cat cafe while I was there. Really enjoyed the people-watching. It would be shopper's paradise. 
A World for Cosmetics,"This crazy shopping district is famous for cosmetics. I do not see the point why they have 4-5 same brand stores in the area, but yes each brand shop has several stores even on the same street. It's quite competitive and it means it's all at pretty reasonable prices. Some Koreans exchange money here too. Big market has the power, I guess. If you are not a shopperholic and want to see others, Myeongdong Cathedral is a great quiet place to visit especially in the evening. And the famous beef soup noodle at Myeongdong Gyoja(Gyoja is dumpling but the noodle is more famous. Their original name from the noodle - Myeongdong Kalgooksu - was copied everywhere while the idea of copyright did not exist in this country several decades ago so they changed the name to Myeongdong Gyoja with the copyright) is something you must try. t became quite touristic, but still good."
Shop 'til You Drop!,The best place in Seoul for me! Many food stalls open in the afternoon and it's great to hang out in there at night! Plenty cute accesories shop and the prize is also reasonable!
Skincare stores and snack street food galore,"Ladies will love shopping at Myeongdong! Lots of skincare stores to choose from too! Plenty of samples are given once you buy just be prepared to carry all your heavy purchases back! Nature Republc, Innis Free, The Sarm, Clio, Skin Food, Etute House and many many more! Lots of street food to try too as street vendors are out with push carts after 5 pm. I especially loved buying fresh strawberries - a box with huge sweet juicy ones only at 5000 won! You can even eat them straight away! Loved the Mouchi red bean covered strawberries sold too at 2500 won each. The juiciness of the strawberry bursts out with the very first bite! It was love at 1st mouthful for me !Then there's the really tasty Bungeoppang- or fish shaped red bean filled pancake . We've tried a number of them all over Seoul and prices vary from different locations. This one that we tried at Myeongdong was filled with cheese and red bean so it was savoury yet sweet and tasty at 3000 won a piece . At other places it's usually about 1000 won a piece ( with just red bean filling ) then there's the tornado potato , squid balls etc . Suggest you bring a shopping bag if you intend to shop here! "
It's as crazy as they say,"Myeongdong has everything you will need and want when in Seoul. Food, fashion, beauty all in one area of streets and alleys filled with stores, hawkers, stalls and even plastic surgery clinics. It's not uncommon for people fresh from the doctor to walk around with their faces swathed in bandages, buying street food at a stall. Just a normal sight in Myeongdong folks. The place is bright and flashy and filled with people. You can fill your stomach with food from the different hawkers stalls selling cheap, clean food. And the portions are pretty big too. Each alley has so many buildings stuck together side by side and each building has has at least one establishment per floor. So don't just look at the ground floor shops, look up and you'll discover that there's so much more to Myeongdong than you thought there was. You can stop and take photos of everything and people don't mind. Do go into the cosmetics shops and try their masks and beauty potions. Don't forget, take advantage of the promos and keep your receipts for the tax refunds at the airport. And make sure you get your gifts with purchase, they give lots of samples of their products. Take note that many stores will have multiple outlets in Myeongdong. Don't worry, it's ok to get lost since you'll eventually find your way again albeit with more shopping bags in your hands before you do. "
Lots of bargains,Great place to stock up on your skincare and cosmetics. The place is packed with most of the Korean brand cosmetics retailers.
BEST PLACE TO DO YOUR COSMETICS SHOPPING!!,"In Seoul, Myeongdong Main Street is where you can find good food, cosmetic and even nice cheap clothes~If you are a huge cosmetic buyer like me, then I would definitely recommend you to stay near Myeongdong area! Many friends of mine was like asking me, aren't you worried of the language barrier when you walk into a shop!?! I replied them, nope! because in Myeongdong, every cosmetic brands will definitely have a staffs who speak Chinese, English or even Japanese language! So you don't have to worry if you are unable to communicate with them to buy the best products for yourself!  I have been to Seoul for 4 times and language barrier wasn't my problem at all. I totally enjoyed talking to all the sales staffs in Korea! During my recent trip, I realize that some of the cosmetic stores actually do immediate tax refund for you during your payment which is totally a good thing! But don't forget you have to make a purchase of 30,000won then you can do your tax refund. Some of the cashiers may not know that you are a tourists, so do remember to ask them if they have tax refund as well. Some dessert places you have to visit is Sulbing & O'sulloc Tea House!! You will never regret going to those places!! And definitely try all their street food in Myeongdong! It's fantastic! Hope everyone who is going to visit Myeongdong will have a great day shopping!!"
Great for shopaholic,Shopping heaven for a shopaholic. From make up and skincare to fashion attire and street food. Everything can be found here.
"If shopping in what you seek, Myeongdong is the destination",Definitely the shopping destination for shopping even though the place is crowded with tourists. this place has wide range of shop from cosmetic to night stand eating.
"get all yr cosmetic here, look out for immediate tax rebate stores","if u are not in a rush, keep walking until u find the stores with immediate tax rebates. Some stores does not have tax rebate, but u can use yr credit card to store a deposit & get immediate cash, but u must go to airport and submit the documents so that they can cancel yr credit card deposit. For example, Innisfree purchases can get cash rebate from 2nd floor of Arataum. Hope this helps."
Shopping time...,"Myeongdong is one of the favorite and a must visited place. Mall, dep store and many store here especially cosmetic store. If you a person who love korean cosmetic, its time to collect them all. Dont be worry, its cheap. If you are hungry, you can find food easily. Shopholic must be love the atmosphere. Accestable by all transportation."
Great shopping and atmosphere,"Myeongdong has a lot of great shopping, even if a lot of it is the same shops repeated multiple times (I'm looking at you, Etude House). But the best part was the evening market with all of it's booths of goods and STREET FOOD. Be sure to hit what I consider to be the highlights- strawberry mochi and the fried honey pancakes (hotteok, if I'm not butchering the romanization). You could eat dinner on the street every night and never repeat a dish. From the look and smell of it, they'd all be delicious!"
"""Pasar Malam' Street in Seoul","Pasar malam refers to night markets in Asean countries.The MSS is walking distance from City Hall and begins from next to Ibis Hotel.Numerous food and accessories joints. some nice restaurants on the side streets serving Chinese,Western,Korean cuisine.turn when you see Mac's and KFC and turn left to find a plaza with numerous restaurants serving chicken dishes including the Korean fried chicken."
Busy,A lot of small shops designer labels restaurants and a very busy people all around bright lights of shop signs and great experience overall
Make-Up LAND!,"This was a great place to hit for all the essential make up stores such as innisfree, etude house, face shop, and etc.. they are all near each other and have many other branches scattered in the area. Yes, there were tons of street food and restaurants too. This place is known for their famous Kalguksu noodle dish located in here, you could google it and TOTALLY worth it.My friend and I hit up the Mom's Touch Cajun Chicken burgers then we went to the CGV movie theater in the mall right near the Myeongdong subway station Exit. My friend and I also lived in the 24Guesthouse for four nights and five days located 5-7min walk to the Myeongdong subway station~ It was great to have everything in one place~ "
Shopping Street,"Shopping street for touristsMostly cosmetic products, local souvenir shops.Food stalls are their as well."
Went crazy here,"Shopping, dining, shopping, dining~thats what you do in seoul really and this place has got almost everything you need."
Compact and over-crowded,"This is definitely an area that attracts an insane amount of tourists, and people in general. I went shopping there in the evening and it was pretty difficult to have a proper look at anything the different stalls were selling due to the relatively narrow streets and throngs of people. As you would know, this is an area that bloggers/people would always recommend visiting. But I didn’t really see its appeal. Any of the cosmetic shops/clothing stores etc you see there, you could also find in any other shopping district in Seoul, but I guess what the location offers is convenience. It literally has every single cosmetic/clothing/café branch that you want to check out. The area is HUGE and takes quite abit of time to cover, if you are the type who likes to take your time looking for things – it could literally take up to half a day or one day. I didn’t find the shopping particularly appealing and a lot of things could be on the pricey end too. But I did manage to get some steals – a very classy looking and sturdy bag under 10,000Won and a very lovely coat for quite cheap as well. I got them off the carts along the streets. There are certainly interesting finds – some of the street food there was pretty good too and I didn’t find them anywhere else in Seoul – but you would really have to spend the time walking around and browsing. The next time I visit I’d probably skip this area!"
Street Shopping,"Myeongdong Market is a great place to start your Seoul City experience. It is similar to many Asian markets; you can find everything under the sun! Vendors are friendly and do not push you to buy. One may not haggle as successfully as one can in SE Asia, but prices are fairly reasonable.The market is a 15-20 minute walk from most hotels and it is a great way to sample the city streets. Walking is easy on wide sidewalks and drivers are courteous."
Great shopping but unlike before,"Expect to see multiple cosmetics & skincare shops of the same brands in Myeongdong - I counted at least 3 Innisfree outlets! They aren't as generous with the skincare samples as before, so do manage your expectations and expect to jostle with tourists especially on weekends. Otherwise it's a great place to shop around, go during night time for the screet food & stalls. "
Beauty Products Galore,Ohhh...no electronics shops...but lots of street foods from 5pm onwards. Great shoes bargain at ABC store
I love Myeongdong!!!!,"I've been in Seoul for 6 days and we went there for 3 times. Myeongdong is the shopping road and along the road got a lot of shop, nice restaurant including street food. My favourite restaurant there was Yoogane (bulgogi) and Myeongdong Kyoja Main restaurant. Also got a lot of nice cafe there! If I go Seoul, I'll definitely go back again!"
Crowded place ,For shoppers this is the right placeYou find all type of shops specially cosmetics and skin careFood lovers are well served seafood BBq everywhere with reasonable prices 
Wonderful shoppong,I loved this shopping street or should I say many streets. This place is easy to maneuver through and an easy walk from many hotels. A visit in the night is a must. The streets are alive with street stalls selling an amazing variety of food. There are so many cosmetic stalls and the prices and deals are certainly worth it. I visited this area in the day and the night and spent way too much money here. Definitely worth adding it to your itinerary if your want a shopping experience.
Shopping,There's a lot of people and a lot of shopping. Overall the people are kind. The street food comes out later in the day.
Great shopping district!,Great shopping district. lots of international brands and beauty brands. Not very cheap though. Great place to try the street food and still enjoy and experience the shopping environment.
Great vibe,"Great vibe. A lot of shopping stores, food stalls, street hawkers. Full of crowd during weekend. I like the street experience here. "
Very self contained,Just love this street.You have the best of everything!From hotels to Street food to cafes and Korean restaurants!You can get everything in there. All the prominent brands are there!Amazing! You can't get enough of it.
Shop until you Drop,"There is actually more than one shopping street in this area. The stores are more upscale then Namdaemun Market but not overly posh or expensive. There are some stalls set up in the middle of the street, lots of food stuff. There are lots of shops for cosmetics, footwear, clothing. You can easily spend couple of hours walking around here. Lots of stores were enticing shoppers with deep discounts."
"Eateries, bargains and shopping galore!","Don't eat a full meal before you come here in the evening! Tons of street food, desserts, and fruit juice stands! There's lots of weird desserts, and delicious street food to experience, the street is misleading as it is more like a whole multiblock shopping area. The area is busy throughout the day, but in the evning, the street vendors come out and start work. Good place to buy gifts and various beauty products as well. "
Good shopping place,"Many famous brand there fir shopping, and also many eatery place there. Good rate for foreign exchange there, I like there even for eating and shopping "
shopping and food haven,must visit for every trip. there are many shops and eateries. can easily spend a few hours in this area. 
good for shopping cosmetics,"a lot of cosmetic shops here, also very happening at night with a lot of food stall. went to the M-plaza for free hanbok experience but the staff said was fully booked (didn't see anyone in hanbok there though)"
Spring shopping in Seoul!,This is surely a must-see when in Seoul. The sights and sounds and the street food are just amazing. There are good restaurants as well if you prefer to eat in a more comfortable and relaxed setting. Make sure you're wearing good walking shoes!
Lots of good food even in winter,LOTS OF FOOD TO EAT AND THE BEST SHOPPING DISTRICT IN KOREA SO FAR FOR ME. Would visit again purely for shopping. People are nice. Cat cafe and dog cafe also readily available.
Shopping galore ,Streets riddled with people and packed with stores and food vendors. Such a fun time. Loved the experience. 
Shopping!,Shopping heaven for makeup lovers and it's a tourist place. They have many brands of makeup around and please do try the andong jjimdak if u are there! They have alot of street food in the evening.. One of my favourite place
Shopping!,"If you love shopping, this is one of the shopping centers to go! Lots of boutique to choose from....has lots of foods / restaurant to choose also!!!!"
Beauty and Food,"Great place to buy cosmetics as they are many repeat shops and souvenirs and shopping. Food is great too especially the street food during the night. Try not to have a heavy dinner so that you can enjoy the street food which they are many.During this period when it is strawberry season, the fruit is cheap (you can get a good one for Won5,000) and have it in your hotel room daily."
shop till you drop,"underground shops straight off the metro linking to more underground shops. you can get carried away for hours.Interesting to see some patients, yes, I mean patients from nearby medical centres coming out in their gowns and with dressings on their faces covered with a mask! The temptation must be great and the attraction must be worth the pain and suffering they are paying for?If you are not the shopping type, just enjoy looking at all the ""perfect"" model-likes young girls parading around!"
Overrated,It was okay for cosmetics shopping tho I feel like it's a bit overrated as there are other spots that offer cheaper prices with as wide a selection. The food was okay tho.
Cosmetics shoes and bags,Almost all the same thing on each street same foods same bags same shoes. Most of the restaurants all serve same thing also. Nice experience though.
Loads of beauty shops,"There are many repeated beauty shops here, each shop having different promotion even though they are the same brand. They give samples when you buy things from the shop. Staffs are able to speak fluent mandarin. In the evening, more street food stalls start to operate. There are also many cafes and restaurants there. There are also many money changers here that give quite high rates, ask around first, some shops give higher rates than the others. "
The food street here is excellent!,"MUST go here for the food street at night. Clams in cheese was amazing! There are a ton of shopping places and skin care shops, its hip and trendy, plently fast fashion stores, but the food was still my highlight"
Vibrant!!,"You can pretty much find anything in here, with the K-Pop feel surrounds you. From Korean style fashion, to street food, to small gift souvenirs for your peeps back home. Just watch out for your spending :p"
A nice and pleasent place for street shopper,"It is easy to find, a lot of shops offer Korean cosmetics, various street food, clothes, bags, shocks, and souvenirs. The prices are reasonable for cosmetics but quite expensive for souvenirs, bags, clothes and event the street foods compare to Namdaemun Market or Dongdaemun area. But still, this place offers you a unique atmosphere for shoppers."
For the ambiance at night,"Well, these are busy shopping streets full of stores, food stalls, etc... and people in between. Hard to call that an attraction, but I must admit that there is quite enjoyable walking there at night, checking the zillions of restaurants around. Not a must though."
Lots of beauty products and food.,There are really many things to buy and eat - from mind boggling range of beauty products to yummy street food and restaurants. You can spend hours shopping and comparing beauty products. Shopping street criss cross each other and there are many intersections. Just be careful of your personal belongings when street shopping. A great place to compare and find out about beauty products. The shop keepers can converse well in Chinese but not so in English.
If you like street food and cosmetics ,"The street food is on the pricey side (within the street food category) as comparing to other areas. Every second store there will be a cosmetic store, and then there are the usual clothing chain, such as H&M, Uniqlo, forever 21 etc… "
Loved this area,"This area of Seoul really comes alive around 5pm when the street food vendors set up, we went a few times. The food was good and the atmosphere was excellent. This is a shopping area and I did look around here but it was at night that I really enjoyed the area."
Still good but not as great as before,"10 years ago, this is where you had great look at the local culture along with fantastic local food fare.what it has become now is a city center shoe piece frequented by mostly tourists. As such, the level of authenticity has gone down and the commercialism has gone up.For first time visitors though, still a must-go place. there are still many gems to be found if you look as far as good local food is concerned."
Busy Shopping Street in Seoul,"This is a must if you're visiting Seoul. Aside from Hongdae, this shopping street offers variety of things to offer from food to shopping to church visit. The street is lined with branded stores as well as local stores from footwear to clothing to beauty products. Korean street food are also available everywhere so u can eat while roaming around. The prices are reasonable and for those in the middle of the streets and not on branded stores, you can also haggle. "
Quite a nice tourist shopping spot,Street food were delicious even though it was slightly expensive. Bought a few outfits there and it was really crowded. Definitely a place to stop by.
Keeps you busy,"This place reminds me of New York CIty, or LA, except the buidings aren't as tall. I think Myeongdong is the heart of outdoor shopping in Korea. The prices for the stores are pretty mixed. You can get expensive and cheap stuff here. It's amazing to be reminded that Korea has grown so much over the years when I went to this place."
Great selection and salespeople but better discounts elsewhere.,Pro: Staff speaks Mandarin. Cons: Loads of shops in the same place but you would find better prices/discounts at shops in Hongdae. Salespeople are also really pushy for you to buy things in bulk.
Our go-to place in the evenings !,"On a 3 night visit to Seoul, stayed at Westin Chosun which is right by the market, we went to the market every evening for food and entertainment, there are plenty of street food stalls, from everything potato, squid, crab, egg toast, fried banana, coated strawberries, sweet and sour chicken, and thousands more all for eating while standing and walking. Plenty of restaurants, bars/pubs and lots of varied shopping. Busy streets at night ! Mostly closed to traffic but the occasional motorbike..."
For the ladies,"Well as a male, I dont fancy makeups or the likes. I am just fine washing my face and neck and that is all. But since you are in Myeongdong, then go buy ladies souvenirs here coz its cheap around 20-30%. I would recommend Dongdaemon if you need to buy past 10pm as it is a 24h open though."
Lively place ,I went there to watch the Nanta show it was a nice experience and one thing to highlight is there are not much public sitting areas almost everything is done standing up 
We went 4 times on our trip ! ,This is a shopper's or rather ladies heaven!Endless shops selling cosmetics . This is a foodie land too. With many yummy variety of food.The street food is an attraction too . You will be spoilt for choice . The location is so convenient to subway ..1 thing that I notice is many train stations cum with basement shopping mall . 
Feels like NYC!,"korean version of Times Square! Shopping here is Really enjoyable. Got some good deals going on. Face shop had buy-1-free-1 for masks, the foreign brands were having some good deals going on too! Street food is yum. Restaurants and cafes are above on the 1st floor. The place is packed later when evening comes. Go in the morning for a more peaceful shopping experience."
Shopping Shopping & Shopping,"Shopping street till late night with lots of foods, fashion and skin products! From Myeongdong metro station exit 7. Just across the road is Lotte Mall & Young Lotte. "
Love street food,Ensure you stay hungry and try to enjoy street foods as you walking or shopping. There're plenty of it and some of them would suit your taste. There is free Wifi at Starbucks 2F where you can sit back and relax while your friends or family members still doing their power shopping out there!
Big city shopping... bring earplugs,"For mainstream shopping - department stores...clothes, shoes, makeup, etc etc. Many major international brands are represented. Lots of street food worth trying. Many restaurants as well. It gets super crowded in the evening, ....and many of the shops start blasting loud techno music (I honestly wish they wouldn't!) which makes one long for the quieter shopping experience of the underground malls."
Shopping for cosmestic,"A lot of selection. The mask is dirt cheap. Man you been warn, if shopping for cosmetic not your thing then please stay put at your hotel or go walk around sampling Korean street food while your other half go banana at Myeongdong"
Disappointed!,"Despite the large crowds, the area has become more expensive! The food stands cost a lot more than other areas and it wasn't good. I had some fried skewers that's supposedly chicken but the texture wasn't chicken and it sure didn't taste like it, either. I wanted to buy a simple and sturdy luggage bag but the least expensive one was W80000 while later on I found one that's adjustable in size with wheels at Nangdaemun Market for W20000. I bought a set of five ceramic soju cups for W5000 at a touristy place in Jeju-do but the exact same set cost W10,000 in Myeongdong. They no longer give as many samples as before at the skin care stores. The Missha store refused to honor the 10%off coupon issued by VisitKorea.com. Disappointing! "
"So crowded, but so much shopping","Competition is strife. There will be repeats of many standard makeup stores, and there are a couple of clothes stores but nothing quite sales-y like the street fashion in the underground stores. However, the store clerks are well-versed in either Mandarin or a bit of English and are super-attentive to your needs.I dislike the crazy crowds that come here, but it would be a must-visit if you must shop in Seoul. I preferred going to Hongdae or the underground malls for my shopping thrill."
Nice Sopping,Nice place to visit. I ended up buying a cart to carry all things we bought. There was a vendor selling all kinds of fried food an I bought a corn dog. The best corn dog I have ever had!! To bad they don't sell this in the USA.
Shopping Location!,Amazing place to shop at for everything from clothes to makeup and much more. The street food is a must in this location.
Lively shopping area with shops and market stalls,Plenty to see here... High street shops with local shops dotted within and market traders ... Fantastic atmosphere!
Lively shopping street,"Myeongdong is a shopping street with lots of street food, restaurants, clothings, accessories and cosmetics shops. It is super crowded at night. Experience the 'pasar malam' (night market). Interesting place to go at night. Myeongdong also has underground shopping. If you can't stand the cold nights during winter, just shop underground"
Cosmetic heaven,For people who likes to shopping it's would be the best choice to visit this place.. You can get so much bonus.. The place is very crowded.. 
soooo crowded,i don't like too much crowd so this place was not that OK for me. went there for the famous myeongdong kyoja and left as soon as i finished lunch. awesome for those who are in seoul to shop! 
Night visit,"Very nice place to walk around at night ,safe and live.You can try some korean food ,fruits and juice.Free activity not to be missed"
Overrated and TOO MANY tourists,"Look I get it, the street is primarily dedicated for tourists so it's a given if you see more tourists like Chinese or Japanese than Koreans but I feel like the street is waay to overrated for anything. There's a lot of better korean beauty shops with better promotions and hangout place like Sinchon or Hongdae and waaay cheaper stuff in Namdaemun or Dongdaemun market. The only tolerable thing in Myeongdong for me is the street food. Anything else? I'll find them someplace else, thanks."
Enlightening to the sences,"It is an understatement to say that this place can overwhelm your senses. We visit Myeongdong as often as possible. We love the sights, the different foods, the crowd and we will continue to visit often for as long as we live here. If you are in Seoul for at least two nights, this is one of the places that you need to come and visit. it is very civilized despite teh crowd. For 5000 W you can enjoy one of many selections of food from octopus to banana crepes to ceramic-like sugar cookies, to chicken. I highly recommend this shopping area. Oh yeah, there are many western stores here as well."
Convenience for shopping and eating every where.,"You could find all the cosmetic, fashion, living products there. Also, it has many restaurants surround there and almost shops will be closed around 22:00. Moreover, it has many street peddler after every 17:00 you must try some special snack of Korea. It's yummy. Lotte department store also there. 3D Stuido, Shooting Centre, some shows there."
Busy shopping street,"tons of shops,millions of people,great atmosphere early in the morning.You can find anything you are looking for,shoes,clothes,cafes,big brands,food stalls."
one of the best markets with eating joints !!!,u can enjoy lot of street food here besides going on a shopping spree.don't forget to bargain !!! many shops that offer free samples as well... for face and beauty products !!
Good market ,Good place to visit you can pick up a lot of big brand stuff but prices aren't anything to write home about but go for a lunch there plenty to do around it and the nic nak stores are good. 
Great shopping!,"You can find everything here...cosmetics, clothes, restaurants, accessories, mani/pedi, massage, hairdresser, glasses, many currency exchange places with good rates..."
Shop unti you drop,Easy to understand. A vast variety of products. Something for everyone. I experienced the sellers as relaxed an respwctfull all the time. 
Brilliant for street food,A really buzzy area with many different shops and loads of coffee shops. Easy to get to on the subway and it has lots of yummy street food options. 
Lots of stores selling the same things,"Many stores and its an eye opening if its your first time in Seoul. We enjoyed the food stalls selling all types of street foods. However, we are a bit turn off by those chinese speaking sales peoples who trying to hard sell while we are walking past the shop. "
Interesting and cheap cosmetics!!!,"This is a beauty zone, but if you are not into it, go in the evening when the food stalls are already put up. Then you will find lots of local delicacy to try! Otherwise, dive into the cheap but wonderful skicare offers!"
Shopping & Food,"Lots of shops, mostly global brands a few independent retailers and Korean Brands. You can probably find most stuff you need and it's cool to wonder round. "
Shopping Galore,This is a more upscale shopping street that was teaming with young adults and so fashionable looking. There are also numerous cosmetic shops and cafes. Good location to find some stylish apparel. 
Interesting place to spend your evening.,"Plentiful food choices around the area. BBQ Pork Belly, Beef Broth, Abalone Porridge, Cafe serving shaved ice desserts, fried chicken korean style etc etc. Not forgetting the various street food you can get here. Street food ain't cheap but it's an experience. Of course, there's the many beauty houses selling their beauty products to the large tourist and local crowd."
Very Crowded,Need to return when it isn't the last stop of an extremely busy day. It's hard to take in the full scope when you're already exhausted. Plan to make another trip a little earlier in the day.
"Shop Shop Shop, This maybe the heart of Korean and Tourist Shopping!","One of Seouls busiest and exciting centers. Lots and lots of shops and restaurants but truly comes alive at night when the street hawkers come out with their food and tons of people walk the streets and alleyways. This is not a small area At least 2 big Pedestrian roads about 500 to 700m long crossing and bunch of smaller alley ways. One end of Myeungdong is actually the Cathedral which is Seouls primary Catholic Church , the other end of this main street is the Lotte Department Store complex. There are also theatres to watch shows and the likes. Lots to see , eat and do. This is full of tourists but even most locals come here to shop and eat as it's complete (as per our Korean tour guide who shops there). Many visitors to Seoul come here a few times on their visit to try the diff cuisines and just people watch."
Fashion,Mainly shopping of the young and trendy. Some street food during evening and for those who simply adores Korea taste.
Crowded,"If you're a tourist here, it's worth stopping by on your way to Seoul Tower, but the it's SO crowded, it's not really the greatest place to spend a lot of time. I prefer to do more of my shopping in Hongdae and other areas around Universities that have smaller shops and you don't have to weave your way through jam-packed streets."
Must visit,"Try to time your visit in the evening so you can experience the night market with loads of street stalls selling food, Knicks knacks, clothes etc."
Great energy in the evening and it was fun to try the street food. People here are friendly and kind. Crowded at night.,Excellent street food. Great shopping. Fun cultural experience. Seoul is very safe. Street food is clean and hot. Noc concerns whatsoever. No problem walking around late at night. Super friendly people as well.
Fashion and street food,Definitely suggested to visit in the eve. Shops are open till 10 PM at least - and you can have here your dinner from the street food cars. 
Interesting and crowded street especially in the night,Interesting and colorful street filled with delicious street food stalls especially during the evening time. Suitable for young adults and even older people during Spring time!
Shopping and eating and shopping,"If time never ends, you can spend forever shopping and eating at Myeungdong and you probably still have not finished your shopping and trying all the street food... Myeungdong is the no. 1 choice for tourists for street food and shopping for cosmetics and face masks (which you should know by now Korea is famous for). Take note that it's mainly for tourists so ya street food prices are relatively high. However you are here to enjoy. So take in the crowds, enjoy the street food and buy lots of face masks!"
Loved the buzz,Great place! Great buzz! Lots of shopping and lots of food stalls.I enjoyed and loved this street and it was nice to see other cultures selling here like Turkish ice cream and Indian shawarma with a Korean twist.A must visit!!
Shopping paradise. ,"This is one of the shopping area for everyone. As it is tourist area, there are free translation service. Just look for those people with tag, they will answer all your question which free of charge. Actually what they are selling here can be found elsewhere at lower price but since they are concentrate in this street, it make it easier for foreigner to get all the things they need at one place. "
Must visit for food and shopping,I walked accross Myeongdong yesterday and have never seen so many people enjoying the ambiance in the streets with all the foodcarts and shops who invite you to walk in. You simply can't skip a visit or you haven't seen Seoul.
I went wild - Korean beauty heaven,"There is no better place to shop till you drop. Great atmosphere, shops for miles and delicious street food to refuel. I recommend bringing an empty suitcase if you like cosmetics as there is no better place on earth. "
Love this place,"I love this place, lots of food and cosmetic shop. Girls would love to browse stores around. I have planned to visit Korea again by the end of this year, and Myeongdong is one of my destinations. "
Must see buzz and vibrance,"Went here on a Saturday, packed with people. Yet so few tourist compared to other Metropoles. Try the street food and and just enjoy the buzz."
Go here at night,"The shops are fine but really nothing you can't find in a hundred other places. The main reason to come here is for the amazing street food at night, some of the best I have had anywhere, especially the fried mozzarella with condensed milk (trust me, it tastes a whole lot better than it sounds) and the pork meatballs. We ended up eating here every night."
Steet shopping,Kinda like mongkok with better quality things. 80pct filled with cosmetic shops...lots of hawker stalls selling interesting snacks at night.
shopping and street foods heaven,"It is a shopong district full of cosmetics, clothes and local street foods. It is easy to reach by metro line blue and stop at myeongdong station. The prices there are bargainable, although it is already at cheap price. The food were really good. You can try the afternoon and night street foods. The foods were tasty and costed friendly."
"Whatever you want, they have it","A place where one gets whatever they want, from food to cosmetics. The trendiest place for fashion lovers, the most well-stocked shelves of cosmetics, huge variety of Korean food and themed cafes for dessert lovers."
Street style,"For those who love street food and street shopping, you may come here. Lots of cheap stuff here. From fashion to beauty products also available. Just to remind, make sure you wont get lost on your way out. The streets junction looks the same everywhere. The crowds are crazy especially during the weekends. But for sure you will enjoy the experience."
Nightime Vaganza,"I came here during the day and during the night.So basically its two different environment.During the day basically you go there for shopping, there are some big brand like NIKE store, Tommy Hilfinger, Club Monaco and many more big brand such as H&M Zara. My advice do walk the alleys, don't just stick to the main road. At night time, it's a different story. In the main road and in the alleys it becomes a night market. You have small stall setting up shop around the road. One thing that I realised is that the arrangement is quite proper, so you should feel safe.The food or the stalls and shops are basically all the same around the place, they sell the same thing in between the area.For example there are several octopus, food street and other items sold in different areas of the shopping street.Basically its a mixed between food, merchandise, drinks and mobile phone covers.A little warning the price is not cheap. Things are sold from 3000-8000 (Baked Shellfish) but it's good to get a variety taste of Korea Street Snacks. Most of the stalls is now run by Chinese people I believe."
A great place to get your money currency,It probably has one of the best currency rates for money exchange. Lots of shops there. Great atmosphere at night time. 
Go in circles,"There are 5 to 6 streets that interconnect so you'll never get lost here........just have to make a note of certain landmark. The street traders only come on about 430pm onwards but many of the eateries operate from around 10am onwards. Most offer local food but I found a couple offering really good Japanese fare if you wish to take a break from kimchi.Those made-in-Korea socks are cheap and good for KRW1,000 to 2,000 . But slightly larger sized ladies, I would give most clothes a miss because 90% is one-size-fits all. If you walk towards the north-east corner where Metro Hotel is located, there're more cafes and western eateries and across the road there's Lotte. Note those steet foods prices are variable ranging from KRW3,000 to 10,000 . But if you go this period, the local strawberries are a must...200% sweetness and cheap. The baked cheese in a stick, cuttlefish, scallops, fishcakes, etc are for the adventurous only. Every other shop is selling Korean skincare products. The masks are really cheap and comes in different 'treatment'.I like the night atmosphere and it's fun."
Sooo good!,"This is heaven for shopaholics! Every store you can think of and a couple more are here. A couple of hours aren't enough. Living in a island, I'm not used to see that much people, but it was ok. You just need to be out of people's way so you don't get push to the side. March is the perfect month to go. Is in the 40-50 almost all day; so it was nice."
Packed with shops - you ca buy almost everything there,We went with no expectations. Was totally surprised how packed the place was with shops.Most stores there are packed with young shoppers and they know how to spend their money.
"nice for evening walks, eating","i loved this place soo much that we went there 3 times during our 5 days stay !! great for skin care purchasing , great for food, and people watching .lively atmosphere "
Shop shop shop,"This is a heaven for a shopper... And also street food hunter like me... A lot of cosmetics shops, fashion products, and street food. This place is so crowded, even more in the night. "
Cosmetics and street food heaven,"If you subscribe to the 10-step method of korean skincare ritual as I do - look no further - this street is the Holy Grail for all things Korean Beauty. HolikaHolika, Faceshop, Etude House, Too cool for School, Iope, Nature's Republic, Club Clio, and MORE!Walking through this street for me was akin to the experience of stepping into Disney World in my younger days. So many inviting shops with so many things I want to try. All the stores stuff bags with free samples with every purchase whether you buy a lip gloss or an entire carry-on suitcase worth of merchandise. Sales staff are friendly and many speak fluent Mandarin (since this is a hub for tourists from Mainland China). Around the side streets, you can find lots of vendors hawking all kinds of delectable street food from sundae, to dokbokki. Very affordable and delicious after a long day of shopping."
Visit all the Shopping areas!!!!,Go every where you can on your trip to Seoul. Friendliness abounds and you can buy just about every thing.
"Korean pop CDs , cosmetic shopping. ","It's a MUST place to visit while in Seoul . Cosmetics shops , fashions , K-pop CDs all found here with reasonable price even cheaper than subways underground market . Fancy handphone cases for Apple iPhone and Samsung also easy to grab. Cute and pretty jewellery with low price selling here may also grab as souvenir for girls."
So crowded on weekends,The shopping here is insane! So many stores all full of the same thing for blocks. Some of the women in the clothing stores are extremely rude and will shove you inside their stores. Those who sell hats on the street sell them for higher prices than other neighborhoods of Seoul. But the street food here is really good. 
Great Place for shopping and STREET FOOD!,"Throughout 10 days of our Seoul trip, we visited MyeongDong 3 times. On crowded days, MyeongDong is busy and packed with tourists. Many salespeople in MyeongDong knows how to communicate in Mandarin. The streetfood in MyeongDong is also great. One of the best I'd tried. It is also the to-go place for cosmetic hunting. "
Shopping and food district in Seoul,"I stayed near Myeongdong Subway so Myeongdong Shopping Street is very near to me. Come here by night as they offer so many stuffs and food items by vendor and when you are best in haggling, you can really do so. Though in buying souvenirs, i do not suggest this place as prices are higher by about 2,000 to 3,000 won compared to Dongdaemun Shopping Center. For cat and dog lovers, don't forget to drop by at Cat Cafe and Dog Cafe!"
Shopping Paradise,"We love Korean cosmetics and it's very easy to find many Korean cosmetics here. We love to shop here because you'll received many Korean cosmetic sample if you're shopping here! Not only Korean cosmetics, you'll also find many clothing store, many food store, many coffee shops and many more. Its complete and we love it.."
Be sure to visit with an EMPTY stomach,"This street is full of food vendors and souvenir vendors! There is good at every turn. Most of it is the same stuff. It almost seems like they cloned the same stores and same vendors in these 6-8 streets. You will feel like there's a lot of stuff but if you pay attention to the store names and the vendors, you will start seeing the same stuff... Meatballs, bacon wrapped hot dogs, giant cotton candy that's larger than the size of your head, fried bananas, tornado chips, honey cakes, egg bread, fried soft shell crab, freshly squeezed orange juice, lemonade, pomegranate juice, tteok (rice cake), stir fried udon, chopchae, corn on the cob, grilled cheese sticks, fish cake stocks, grilled octopus stocks, grilled chicken skewers, red bean and pumpkin porridges, banana Nutella crepes, fried ice cream, seafood pancake, meat dumplings, fried chicken, kimchi rolls, roasted chestnuts.... The list goes on and on... Beware... The majority of the food is fried!!! So while it's good make sure you have some hot tea afterwards or your stomach is not going to be very happy with you! Souvenirs cost pretty much the same as in other markets (Namdaemun and dongdaemun)... Although the variety here is a bit limited!!!! There's a ton of make up / face care stores!!! Everyone speaks English here, mandarin, Japanese or Korean... So no need to worry if you don't know Korean. Everyone is very nice here too!"
All kinds of shopping,"Here you can buy exclusive brands, but also low price stuff on the small narrow streets. Street food and restaurants everywhere."
Shopping galore,Enjoyed the shopping. Caters to those seeking a deal or high end shopping. Sales people are friendly and not over bearing. Great food to be had in the area too.
Shopping heaven,"If you like street food, shops, more food and more shops, this is the place to be. It was lively and bright with endless selections of grub to keep you full and things to buy to keep to wallets empty! You will also get lots of freebies at the cosmetics shops and the price difference from RM to Won is truly jaw dropping, ie, the cosmetics are so darn cheap here! And the selection seems endless. Be careful with the sales assistants' lack of English though, 80000₩ sounds so much like 18000₩. Shopper's paradise through and through."
Shopping places,"You can see so many stores especially make up stores and clothing. I bought so many ""skinfood"" for my friend (they gave me lots of masks as bonus) and you should ask for tax refund there)And there are many street seller for food, accessories, tshirts for kids, etc.The price are not cheap for food and tshirts (compare to my country)But maybe you should try to ""insadong"" some people said it is cheaper."
Must visit.,"Any lady that is visiting korea must visit this place. This location is packed with cosmetic stores. If your hotel is not close by, bring a small suitcase because makeup and face mask can get quite heavy. My hotel happen to be right in Myeongdong and I enjoy every day staying here. There are many street food vendors but sadly I did not get to try since there were so many good affordable restaurants here. Also, I suggest you know your makeup prices before shopping here. I found Lotte Supermarket had 50% off sales that weren't offered at the locations in myeongdong."
Great for shopping!,"You can literally satisfy all your shopping needs in Myeongdong, especially for cosmetics as every alley has at least 5 Korean cosmetic boutiques! They used to give more samples with every purchase, but nowadays you might actually have to ask them nicely if you could get more samples. Still, a great place to shop nonetheless!"
Shopping and eating heaven,"A long street lined mostly with apparel shops and cosmetics stores (multiple branches of different brands), plus streetfood stalls on the sidewalks (Yum!). Not really a place for bargaining, but you can score makeup freebies from different stores. Be prepared for the crowd though. "
GREAT!,My most favorite place in Seoul! I would always come here every weekend! I just love to just roam around this wonderful street.
Shop til you drop,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is full of people all the time, more so early evening when locals finish work and buy from street vendors selling really yummy snack food, you really need to try steamed egg buns, delicious. Shops galore, from beauty shops to handbags, clothing, shoes, more beauty, cat cafes to sip a hot chocolate while relaxing by a window watching the world go by with a cat on your lap or around your shoulders, different experience. The atmosphere is amazing, staff trying to coax people inside shops with all sorts of discounts. Busy,busy,busy"
SHOP SHOP N EAT EAT!!!,"This place is a haven for shoppers as they open 24 hrs. If you go to the market, make sure to bargain price and eat there as street foods are out of this world."
Fried street food and same Same shopping,"The vibe is lively, the street food can be greasy, and how many cosmetic shops can be squeezed into about 8 square blocks? Still it's fun! Open early (for Seoul) until late."
Shopping and street food,Enjoyed looking through the shops; most shops accept credit cards and speak some English; loved trying food from the street vendors
Crazy crowded with people,"If crowds give you energy, this is the place to be. If crowds take energy from you, then maybe this is a place to pass. There are abundant clothing shopping opportunities in this area."
Shopping paradise,"Area full of shops, especially if you are looking for Korean clothes and make up and restaurants. You may feel a bit scared about the confusion but it's all part of the experience. "
you can buy a lot of cosmetic here. very happening.,"I am Malaysian, so, I found that the snack in korea is expensive. the pancake is selling 3000KRW, flower ice ream about 4000KRW & etc. but they are not selling higher price in myeongdong although this is tourist attraction point, its generally high in seoul."
prob you go there at least once,明洞 is one of the most famous places in Seoul.you go there at least once but you don't have to go there again. 
Shopping .. Shopping... Shopping.. !! ,"We love this places very much.. We are shopaholic.. And the street full of stores. We can shop every step .. Cosmetics, clothes, food street, Korean resto, Japanese and Vietnam resto, coffee shop etc. you must visit this street in day and night when you come to Seoul. Highly recommended for shopping lovers. "
"street food, korean style","Enjoyed the street food, although if you are looking at price, it's not really cheap. But it's fun, lots of the locals visit this daily. "
Shop til you drop,"Nothing better than Myeongdong shopping street when come to lines of shop for skincare, cosmetic , fashion. The eating street filled with famous street eat of korea start from evening which make this place pack with shoppers & food seekers"
Fun to window shop,"Makes for a good walk, streets are organized by goods. Its easy to grab severals bites of goodies to munch as you walk along and window shop. Very close to the metro."
Lots of international brands,"If you want to shop at big brand name stores, this place has it all. In addition to being right next to a Lotte department store. "
Shopping lovera,"If you love shopping. This is the place to be. I am not a shopper but I enjoyed the atmosphere especially with the bright lights at night. Various street food to eat , which is what I enjoyed most."
"Shopping, shopping and shopping!!","It is a great place to buy cosmetic, masks and other skin care products. I bought so many things here. I wish I could come again. The only downside is that some of the shops are a bit aggressive sometimes."
Myeong-Dong: The Street Food and Cosmetics Haven,"When you first set foot in Myeong-Dong, you can easily tell that it's the place where men and women, both locals and foreigners, gather around to find the best value in cosmetic and facial care products.If you are travelling with your wife or your girlfriend, you should definitely visit this place the moment you arrive in Seoul. It is one of the places in East Asia where you can buy branded cosmetic products for a very low price. For husbands, there are a lot of food stands that could easily occupy your time while waiting for your wives to finish shopping as they can be found almost everywhere in Myeong-Dong area. Korean Delicacies like Odeng, Gimbab, Eomukba, Muneo Dari Gui,and Egg breads can easily be found in the shopping street if you're feeling hungry, but if you're looking to eat steamed silkworms, you'll only be able to find them in older traditional markets or in Nandaemun.There are almost 2000 cosmetic stores to get lost into in Myeong-Dong, but in the end, just tell your wife that you're travelling on a limited budget. All in all, it's a fun place to experience street food and cosmetic shopping, but if it's electronics that you want you'll be better off in Yongsan's I'Park Mall."
Loved it! But come prepared,"I absolutely loved the atmosphere there. There are food stalls everywhere where you can try weird but delicious foods and there are many shops to visit.However it is very crowded and it's not always easy to watch out for pickpockets. I was aware of this so I put a padlock on my backpack to keep the pocket where I had my wallet and passport safe. I put some money in a tiny purse around my neck and just like that it went fine.Do not let yourself be scared of pickpockets, just be prepared and enjoy the busy Street. "
Who doesn't like shopping??,"I sank suggest this place for a very pleasant place for shopping if it is not raining. It was too bad that I didn't grab that pair of leather shoes, still wanna go again and again......for shopping of course. ^^ the people were so nice and kind...."
I love it,"It is so interesting shop there so many kind of things to do there : you can buy clothes, cosmetic, bag , shoes and there's also a massage and nail place. There is a lot of street food and global food like Macdonald and burger King it's so amazing. However, if you don't like crowded place you won't love it and for less crowded go on working day not the weekend. Hope you like as I did. "
LIVELY,"For those who loves Korean cosmetics and street food, this is the place you would wanna go. They sell cosmetics and most of them provides tax refund service as a lot of travelers find this place is a must visit when they're in Korea. So no worries about your tax!"
Crazy flooded with tourist,"I think it's cool to visit the 'in' thing of Seoul shopping district but then again, this area is just crazy flooded with tourists. Well if you still insist on going, come after 4pm or so, the food stalls start setting up and the crowds get their new diversion. I did witness a fight along the street though, so well it was refreshing. "
Alive and Fun!!,"If you have not been to a traditional ""market place"" in Seoul, you must not miss it. If you have been there before, you must visit again. It is a shopping area that attracts both locals and travelers. As you walk down row after row of streets and side streets, you are presented with an endless array of shops, restaurants, sidewalk attractions, and so forth. You can see waves of people, young and old, just walking and browsing the streets, eating street food and having fun. Across the street from the southerly entry, you can dash over to the Lotte Department Store where pricey goods and designer shops are available, as well as duty free. But when you are in Myeongdong, you must visit the street level places or you will miss an experience. (In years past, this was also an area that attracted pick pockets; due to aggressive law enforcement those sights are rare now but you should still be on your guard and not lose your personal belongings even inadvertently.)"
Great Food & Shop,"Great spot for street vendors food, shopping and entertainment. Loved it. During the day the vendors aren't there so not as lively but still lots of shops. Around 430-500 everyone was coming out."
Night Market and Shopping Street,"it's a nice place to enjoy the street food - there's a good variety. I personally won't buy any stuff from the street shops as the prices are generally higher than those at the markets (like Dongdaemun). The place is chock full of cosmetic shops, probably the dream of all into skincare. You'll have plenty of sales girls trying to get you into their shops with free gifts."
Fun and Interesting,Here you will find the best street food and other bargains! Come at 4pm onwards for an awesome gastronomic experience!
Food Trip,Myeongdong to me was a food haven. There's just a variety of street food and food shops around. Not to mention shops (local and international). The place is clean for a very busy place. I went there during the night time but I am not sure if it is as lively during the day.
A fashion shopping neighborhood.,"This is a place with many fashion shops, and there is a nearby metro station. Also there is a nearby bus station for getting up a City Tour Bus. This is not surely a must see place if you have little time in Seoul."
Fun shopping and great eating,"This hip area has all the things you are looking for! It has shops of all types and you can wander in and out. Some shops found it necessary to follow us around, make up stores mostly, but it could be their jobs, but it was fun to look at all the amazing products. There are tons of tents that set up with food and other shopping possibilities! Cat playground was fun too!"
The place to shop (especially cosmetics),"Myeongdong is packed with both attire and cosmetic stores. You can see several Nature Republics, Skin Food, Etude. etc while walking around the area. Definitely the place to go to buy cosmetics. They also have a variety of street food from gyeran ppang (bread with a whole egg in it), fried potatoes, pomegranate juice, etc. There are variety of snacks you can pick from though I do realize that they are slightly more expensive as compared to other non-tourist areas in Seoul. As for food, you can never go hungry as you can pick from ddeokbukki, Japanese food to myeongdong kalguksu. There is also a cultural center which teaches how to make kimchi. The only thing is that for those who do not like any place packed with people this might not be your favorite spot. It is always packed with people all day long but it is worth a visit!"
"Freezing cold, but hot scallops!","We explored Myeongdong Shopping Street late in the night after dinner at a nearby bulgogi restaurant. The weather was freezing in January, but one of the best things about this was the piping hot street food from the stalls lined up along the street. There was this stall serving fresh giant scallops off the shell, the guy would scoop the scallop out of the tank, shuck it, pop on a generous topping of cheese, and then blowtorch the lot into a gooey, bubbling pile of scallop and cheese, eaten straight off the shell standing on the street in -3C cold."
Shopping haven,"We came here almost every night of our stay in Seoul, and every time we find something new! Facial and cosmetic products aside, you will find street stalls selling all sorts of Korean delights (only at night) and little shops selling clothe items and accessories (bags, shoes etc) at very good prices and very high quality too. If you are a bargain hunter, then MyeongDong is not to be missed!"
Always a great time day and night!,"One of the best spots for shopping and a must see if you're in Seoul. You can start in the early afternoon, and stay into the evening when the streets of Myeongdong transform into almost a carnival - street carts come out, merchandise is all over the place, music is blaring, food carts are steaming and the food is great! Shop for bargains, eat great food on sticks and with sticks, and simply have a good time! I do every time! Enjoy! "
No cars shopping street in Seoul,Many international and Korean fashion shops. If you like shopping go their and downs a half day strolling thru no cars street.
Shop till you drop- why? Because you can!,"If you can't find there, you don't need. A fun labyrinth of small and large shops sprinkled with many food stalls and cafes. And if you need any cosmetics, oiy, don't get me started!"
A must visit each time we return to Seoul,"This is always our first stop on our return to Seoul, mainly because our hotel, Lotte, is located round the corner, and also because we love the variety of food options here.Unfortunately, our usual beef restaurant, Bulgogi Brothers, has closed though we found a beef and bibimbap eatery, Gogung, with the help of the tourist information bureau. This is also the place where the family buys face masks from Skin Food, Too Cool To Be In School, Body Shop and other similar shops.At night, there are street stalls along the main thoroughfare, and you should try the fries encrusted corndogs, kimchi pancakes, grilled scallops and dessert options like strawberries. Of course, they also have the usual shops like H&M, Uniqlo, Adidas and Zara."
Shop Til You Drop Street,"This shopping area were not just a street, its a village type of shopping area. I stayed for 5 days in the same area but wasn't able to check all stalls. Bought 8 shoes and some stuff. The brands and stalls are very nice! Will surely be back on this shopping street!"
where Cute Socks & Cute creative mask lives,"love this place, actually they have many same shops in a same place. I kept seeing animal mask, it seems to be a trend now in korea. And also the very common cute socks...you can buy them for just 1000 won each. if you buy more about 10 you will get 1 free."
Shopping and People Watching,"If you want to experience an amazing shopping area then Myeongdong is your area. There are so many fantastic shops, cafes and restaurants all packed into one area. If you love Korean facial products then you will be in heaven."
A heaven for food hunter,"Easily reach by subway. Countless restaurants for food hunter. Shopping wise, the price is slightly higher than dongdameung. "
A mecca of beauty products,"Streets and alleys lined up with face products from the well known and some i only encountered here. If you buy alot of stuff they're supposed to give you samples and i mean samples... That was like only 2 years ago. Now, they'd just give like 3 or something for 65k won. If you feel hungry, don't fret... You wouldn't feel hungry as you would get a chance to eat and drink to your stomach's content. From baked milk, noodles, kimchi, gelato and sausages... I tried the noodles and the sausages... Noodles were great. Sausages have different flavours sticked altogether. All was doing well until I tasted curry at the 4th sausage and that was it for the sausage... I cant take the curry."
Street Food - A Feast for the Eyes!,"Should be a part of your itinerary when in Seoul. One will never get bored with the amount of street food available, bright lights, busy alleys and affordable clothing items. Make sure to grab some nice pair of quality socks for just 1,000 KRW!!!"
Myeongdong has everything,Myeongdong is always the place to go if you're looking for anything in particular or nothing at all. It's a collection of all the famous Korean stores plus western stores too. Beware that it's always crazy crowded and that street vendors only come out at night or on the weekends
Myeongdong Shopping Center,A place for ladies to shop •••There r 100's of Korea Beauty Shop to choose from.Try to bargain for the price or asked for discount
Shopping heaven!,Full on shopping fun in Myeongdong! Amazing vibe and a colourful window on the world of Korean retails.
Good place for women,"The place where good for women shopping.there are different restaurants , shopping malls you can find. "
Broke but Worth it!!,"This place is like the spin off, of Times Square, literally has everything you need, street foods were spectacular, tip is bring more money so save up and spend all you want. It was so worth it!"
Totaly love this place,"One place have to visit in seoulAll the street food are interestingCosmetic store, fashion from top to toe, accesories, all you need is judt enjoy them all"
Make Up Shopping Center,"Full of shops, mostly sell cosmetic with a good price. But the food stall will help you who doesn't like shopping, you can try with variety snacks they sell."
K-pop style make-up,"This place lives by it's name, make-up street. If you have a make-up shopping agenda, do go to Myeongdong. However, I think it is better to shop in shopping malls (more comfortable at any time). There are lots of street food. Some are very good, especially the grilled cuttle fish. There's passion fruit juice looks really good but we were full. It's really hard to abstract juices from passion fruit because of the seeds. But the juice is pure. There are lots of dining in Myeongdong but I find it more expensive than Insadong. I prefer dining in Insadong or in restaurants in shopping malls. "
Never ever miss this place. Ever!,"People once say that if you go to Seoul, Myeongdong is the only place you need. Well it is kinda true. Nothing beats being here. With all the shops and foods. Nothing else matters as long as you are here. One day is definitely not enough to comb the whole place."
Fantastic Feelings in this Food and market Street,It was amazing to spend some hours walking in the middle of thousant corean people and a lot of food street sellers. A lot of shops with loud music and nice items to buy. Great time specially for the week-end when the streets of this district ar crowded.
Shopping heaven!,"Located in the center of Seoul,near to Namsan, this is the place that will turn you into a sinful shopaholic. From trendy clothing brands to fancy accessories, to streets of famous beauty product shops to delicious street foods,you name it..its all here!..a great place to hangout and a lot of good cafes are here for you to visit. Lets shop till you drop!"
Shopping heaven ,"It's a must visit if u are in Korea ! A lot of skincare cosmetic shop here , cheap price but u need to be careful when u purchase! u can c a lot of same company shop in the same street but they r giving out difference promotion n also gift ! A lot promoter standing outside door to give out free gift attract u come in to store browsing, after u step in to store and they will start keep promoting n standing beside u to pushes you buy, very hard sales !gentle reminder , u must double check your receipt n also quantity of items purchased before leave.we found out that they extra charged us and also put less items we bought in to shopping bag . Kinda sad =(Anyways , this is a good shopping place ! I like it ~"
Great place to shop and eat!,"OMG this place was so crowded and full of people. But at the same time, I had so much fun because the place had a lot of shops and the night market was amazing! I think I almost tried everything from the street vendors lol"
Myeongdong is my home!,"I've been to Korea 3 times in the past 5 years. Call me crazy but I love the place. Every time I go I stay in Seoul, and more specially, Myeongdong!I know this place like the back of my hand now and I never get tired of it. I've stayed here with friends, colleagues, and on my own and in every scenario it has been so much fun.Filled with great restaurants, shops that go on forever, 24 hour bars, and a great view of the lovely Namsan Tower every now or then, what more could you want?!While travelling alone, I always worried about being bored in my spare time. But staying in Myeongdong solves that problem right away. I spent all my free, alone time there shopping for clothes and makeup, and eating delicious food. Seriously everything you need is in Myeongdong!"
Lots of street food,A long length of stores in a street with lots of street foods that are clean and are properly handled. Sellers are honest and cheerful. Most Stores close at 10 pm while some at 9 pm. This is a must visit place while in Myeongdong. 
a woman shopping paradise,"I have been here three times, two times with my family (one that when I was a primary school kid and one that when I was about to start my uni), and my most recent visit to Myeongdong was by myself. I kind of witnessed how it has changed over the past years. It is a major tourist attraction for shopping for many years, but it has become more and more crowded by tourists, especially after K-Pop got its popularity internationally roughly since 10 years ago. Even most street hawkers can speak Chinese, not to mention those in cosmetic stores. The upside is, there will not be any language barriers for all Chinese, English, Japanese speakers during their shopping, but the downside is, you will not know what the local Koreans like if you only visit this place, since I don't see many locals around (The most frequent languages I heart in this place are Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and to certain extent Japanese). For those who are interested in clothing, cosmetic, accessories, etc., this is a shopping paradise. But for those who want to know what the ""real"" Korea is like, this is not my suggestion."
"Food, Cosmetic, Accessories All in One Way","I had a wonderful experience in Myeongdong. Even most of the visitors are youth, but it is fun to go there with family. I strolled around Myeongdong in a day and it's not enough. If you go with your friends or family who have a different interest from you, you don't need to worry about that. For a cosmetic lovers, you can find many cosmetics shop there. You already bought some but you still want more with the same brand, such as innisfree, nature republic (that's what happened to my mom)calm down you can just walk a hundred meters and find the store. What about food lovers? of course you can try various kind of street food or restaurant food there. You can choose any kind of food that you want at any price it depends on your preference. My friend prefer to eat street food than restaurant food, and 2 or three food is enough to make your stomach full. Accessories? Still it is heaven for you. You can look and find any kind of accessories whether in the street or in the shop. So have a good time at Myeongdong"
A must go destination in Seoul.,Great experience at night when you can also indulge with a wide variety of street food while enjoying the colorful neon light signs. 
lots of chinese and japanese travellers and sellers on a bustling crowded street,"basically between the two stations line 4 myeongdong and line 2 euljiro 1 ga this street is lined with clothing, accessories and cosmetic stores. its well known for being crowded with tourists and in the vicinity is the huge main lotte department store, shinsaegae dept store, lotte young plaza which has products for younger people and also a Line friends store etc."
Time to burn some cash,"It was crazy! If you go to the Myeongdong subway, you will find cosmetics stores lined up but most of them cater to Thai customers. You go up those stairs and you will find an alley full of stores that mostly cater to the Chinese customers. Walk a bit more then you will find the alley catering to Japanese customers and others. I literally got a headache from all the hubbub. Leave your credit cards at the hotel if you don't want to be deep in debt. TIP: Missha often has 50% off days so wait for those. "
"It's pretty crazy here, but apparently the place to buy your cosmetics.","This place was bustling even though it was a cold, windy day. It is supposedly even more chaotic at night though we didn't experience it firsthand. We didn't know what kind of shopping to expect here, but it is more on the high-end and heavily populated by cosmetics stores. There's a lot of competition between cosmetics stores, so combing through the sales and shopping around will allow you to load up at decent prices. Each cosmetics store seems to have a barker out front. They also try to spice up the deals with freebies of all sorts when you purchase something. Now, they are trying to get your business, but they are nowhere near as aggressive as the Chinese in either mainland China or Hong Kong. So, don't feel pressured. If you buy a lot of cosmetics (and other eligible goods), you may be eligible for a tax refund. Myeongdong is one place that you can get the refund (also Incheon Airport). But, you have to fill out the forms they provide and have your passport. We didn't bother. It was too cold to walk further down the street to the building where you apply for the refunds. Myeongdong is not that big of a shopping area. You can probably walk the whole district in a couple of hours. There are numerous places to eat, so no problem there. If bargain clothing and cheap things are your thing, there are better places than Myeongdong for that in my opinion (Dongdaemun, for one). Myeongdong is a stop on the subway blue line."
A very lively street,"Many roadside stalls selling food and other stuff with many, many cosmetics and clothing shops lined around the area.Could be a bit too jam-packed and have to be careful as vehicles were still allowed on the shopping area despite it being so crowded."
Affordable Shopping Street.,A long and big area of streets stalls and hawkers. Varieties of goods for bargain and friendly seller. Visited this place for few times and spend many hours.
Amazing place to shop and dine,"I've been in Seoul twice now and totally love Myeongdong. Good place to shop and dine, in the evening you can find lots of street foods around. "
A LOT OF STUFF!!!,"there is a lot of food, shoes, clothes, and more food and snacks and food again! i love strawberry and in Myeong-Dong they got everything for real"
We're more browsers than shoppers,"and this didn't really cut it for us. Nothing like the markets you'd get in other Asian cities. On the other hand if you are a shopper, you might be in heaven!"
"Lower Your Expectations (Average shopping, generic street food)","We visited Korea last year and this was the one area that I found the most disappointing. Every other shop tries to pull you in with varying languages and it really put us off going into any shop to browse because they won't leave you alone. The products are also all the same, I don't think it's worth going into any of the generic facial product shops. The only ones possibly worthwhile (seriously) are the places that retail a particular brand (e.g. Laneige or A'Pieu). Don't bother with the generic tourist traps that sell a bulk of face masks they claim have gold leaf or snail extract. I remember alot of 'free' gifts used as bait. The shops that don't try hard and have lots of locals are the good ones.Also, street food wise it was very mediocre. I probably have higher expectations though because of places in Taipei, KL, Beijing etc. Personally its somewhere you will undoubtedly visit, but I wouldn't do my shopping in Myeongdong or expect much."
Must visit ,"If you love Korean cosmetic and want to try Korean nightlife, I suggest you to visit myeongdong shopping street. There are a thousands popular shop including cosmetic, shoes, bags, clothes and food. Almost every shop can speak very good English."
Beauty Haven,"If you are into Korean beauty products then this is the place to visit! I enjoyed shopping here. There's also lots of yummy street food. During our stay in Seoul, we went here 3 days in a row."
Cosmetics and Street Food Paradise,"Calling all Makeup Junkies! Loads and loads of BB Creams, Snail Cream, etc. What I like most is the street food! Goodbye Mongkok. Theirs is so much better. Different variety of korean street food and they're all delectable!"
Great place for night walking ,"If you search for branded high class things to middle brands this is the place.. there is lotte mall which carried lots of branded name.. such as louis vuitton, gucci, prada, etc.. but it closed very early around 8.00am and there is no toys store around so its not very recommended for family with kids.. the street it self is very hip and good for street food "
Cheap Shopping!,"This is well worth your time! There is a lot of shopping at bargain prices, especially if you're willing to haggle! In addition to the street vendors, there are nearly over 100 established stores. "
Great shopping and street food,I know most people come here for the shopping but my favorite part is all the street food. It's a fun lively area with a huge number of reasonable shops -- not the fancy fancy type.
Go at night,Best time to go at night. More Street food. Also there alot of cosmetic shop. So many of the repeated shop so don't worry if you miss the first shop. Also if the shop is crowded or long queue at counter. They sometimes don't give many staples. So do take note.also the fruits there are expensive. I bought a box of strawberry at other neighbourhood for 5000won. Myeongdong sell at 14000won. What a rip-off. I find the first stall ( near uniqlo)owned by and old woman that sell daebokki is nicer as the sauce is thicker.
Korean Beauty Products Heaven,"Here you could find a lot of Korean beauty products store with cheap price and lot of sample bonuses. Not only beauty products store, you also would find a lot of local brand clothing store with high quality and fashionable stuff such as A land and many more. You could also find snacks and cheap clothing on the street."
Must see,We had a great time walking around and collecting free face masks from shops. Lots of shopping and great food in the area.
Myeongdong Shopping,Best Shopping coz of Grand February Sale!!! Lots of choices. Street Food was equally good. Side streets have more stores
"Touristy, but worth the visit","I am normally a person who prefers to go more to a place where locals go, but Myeongdong is an exception. First, the massive amount of food stalls make it unique as it offers a variety of Korean and Fusion foods for prices up to 5000 KRW (5 USD). Then, the amount of well-known stores makes it having a good combination of locals and tourists on the area.However, this is still a good place to buy souvenirs but not highly recommended as it is mostly focused on the pop culture (same as places like Shibuya in Tokyo or Powell St in San Francisco, CA) and it may be a little bit pricier than usual areas. So you may consider areas like Insadong or Dongdaemun.Overall, Myeongdong shall be your first night stop, as this place gets more vibes during the night with the variety of outdoor stalls you can go around."
Great day out shopping,"Myeongdong is my favourite shopping street in Seoul because as well at the cheap stalls and market feel, there's also a lot of well knowing stores and an indoor shopping centre so you can kind of enjoy both sides of shopping. There's also a lot of bars, restaurants and street food. As well as this, it's in a great location, easy to get to by subway and the atmosphere is fab, especially near Christmas. "
Great to stroll around and pass time ,Evenings are nicer with the street food. Lots of shopping especially if you looking for cosmetics. Vegetarians and Halaal foodies will struggle for a bite. 
Shopping and Restaurants Galore,"The shopping streets were lively, warm, and exciting place to visit. I am glad that I decided to stay in a hotel in the same areas. Thousands (I felt like that) of restaurants to choose from and shopping options were overwhelming. The areas were very nice to walk at night. This is a must-visit place in Seoul!"
Great shopping experience but...,Overall great shopping experience - no issue in language as most shops offer sales assistant who speaks chinese - however some shops sales assistant were fairly pushy - keep pushing for bulk buying and if you are not buying in bulk they were quite reluctant to help further..
Shopping and food ,"We ate our way through this street , the food is generally nice .Theres lots of shops here like this place even on a cold winter night"
Shoping area must visit in Seoul,"I stay at hotel in this area. This area getting crowded around 11.00-21.00. Mainly it is like shopping paradise for tourist and local. You can find many branded fashion, cosmetic, restaurant and street food that you must try. You can just take Metro Line 4 to Myeongdong Station and take exit 7 or 8, then you will find the crowd. "
Shopping heaven!,"One of my favorite places in Seoul! If you're a fan of Korean cosmetics, Myeongdong is the place to go! All your favorite Korean cosmetic brands are here, along with Western clothing brands and specialty stores. They have an Onitsuka Tiger outlet here, too. If you're feeling tired and hungry from all the shopping and walking, you can grab a bite at the cafes and restaurants scattered around the area, or you can buy food from the food stalls that usually open during afternoons."
Experience Korean street food and shopping here!,This place is near our hotel and is fantastic if you want to experience Korean street foods and do make up shopping. I love how they close late at night (11 PM) so we often go here after our tours to relax and look at the shops. The brands that we saw here are usually Korean but there are also international bran stalls though we usually skip them. Tip: You can ask for product samples on make up stores. Some cashiers may not know that word though so you can search for the equivalent Korean word. You can also haggle with the stalls outside the shops.
Very good shopping place,"If you want to get your skincare / cosmetics items, here is a good place as it is a one stop station for all brands! Most of the shops has staff who knows Chinese and English more of Chinese I would say"
Nice place for shopping and food,"Its a very nice place for shopping . There are lots of brand shop, make up store that made in korea . Also have shoes shop here . Lots of sneaker u can find , and good price too !! In the evening there will be street foods that sell lots of tasty food you can try , price average 3000-5000 korean won. more than this there still have many restaurant , korean dishes . The must u must go :)))"
Wide range of shopping opportunities,"This neighborhood is known for the shopping and there is quite a range, from luxury goods to mid-range duty-free options. I enjoyed Lotte and Shinsegae, the two big department stores, where I purchased everything from seaweed and red gingseng to handmade jewelry, Tumi luggage and unique scarves. I preferred Shinsegae to Lotte because it was less crowded and the merchandise was very nice, including unique Korean made clothes."
"Go for shopping clothes, souvenir, and nice dinner","There were so many cloth shops and restaurants. We had a dinner at Baekjeong Korean BBQ in Myeongdong. There were many nice street food vendors too for example grilled seafood, fresh strawberry, softserve etc"
shopping street,"you can find everything their, cheaper price, many different sales, a lot of shops and restaurant, it s little busy Area , good place to spend a few hours and buy a gift for family and friends"
lively at night,it was an experience staying and shopping in this area. lively at night with all the food stalls where you can experience korean street food. if ever ill go back... will definitely stay in this area. 
Cosmetics shopping spree,"Best place to go shopping for cosmetics but i do find that the stores are all pretty similar, selling similar stuff.Stores in this area are familiar with tourists so mostly they can speak english and they will give u tax refund form without you asking.Try to visit from 4PM onwards as the street food kiosks start in the afternoon"
Hustle Bustle Street Food and cosmetics,"The smells and noise of a busy shopping area where you can buy various assortments of food from street vendors. It's even great just watching them prepare the food whether it be deep fried squid or meatballs to pancakes with chocolate and banana it is a fantastic experience. As for the main shops. If you are in dire need of aloe or snail face masks this is the place for you...really! Every other shop sells the stuff! No wonder the locals don't have a wrinkle between them haha! There are clothes shops, main chains, and they are no better prices than the UK or US. I was looking for a tech shop and after an hour of searching gave up hope. Ended up buying a face mask for the camera instead!"
Tourist street. ,"If you're looking for cosmetic products then you got to the right street. Various beauty product brand in this street. Food wise there are many restaurants however price can be on the high side and not necessary the best. If you're looking at purchasing fruits, there are many stalls there. Try going to lane which is less people, you will get better bargain compared to the stalls at the Main Street. Keep an eye on the on coming motorbikes and cars. It seems a bit dangerous to me as they maneuver around the crowded street. "
NICE MARKET PLACE!!!,We love shopped here.. There are lots of freebies wen u buy in a shop.. The vendors and staff in shops are all friendly.. They give u a lots discounts.. I want to go back here...

Best place to shop for Korean Cosmetics,"I love Myeongdong for cosmetic shopping. Not only do they sell them in bulk at cheaper prices, they also give a lot of freebies. There are also a lot of stores to choose from, and almost all of the Korean cosmetic brands that I know have a branch here. I also love visiting Myeongdong Cathedral, and visiting Myeongdong's underground shops to buy Kpop related merchandise."
Korea night markets!,"Love the markets at Myeongdong. We went at night and despite the COLD weather, it was packed. LOTS of things to choose from food, clothes, make-up, accessories and all sorts!

Shopping mecca,"Fantastic place to shop for cosmetics, clothes and souvenirs. Great for people watching, full of great restaurants as well."
Shopping and food haven,"There are so many shops in such a small area, especially the cosmetic and skincare stores. There are also big department stores like Shinsegae and Lotte nearby. The department stores have a great variety of winter coats and jackets, but the quality ones are quite expensive by western standard. I stayed in the centre of Myeongdong for five nights and really enjoyed being close to so many nice restaurants and eateries."
Night time shopping,"Fun to stay here to try street foods, restaurants, shopping especially Korean cosmetics. Small Streets are for youth people especially fun in night time. Whenever I come to Seoul, I always save my time for this area."
Shopping Paradise,"There a lot of stores to shop around. Especially for korean brand cosmetics. There are a few cat cafes and do visit them if you have the time to sit down for a cup of tea/coffee and play with them. Beside shopping, there are a few nice cafes around the corner to dine n relax after shopping. "
Make up heaven!!!,Ive stayed in Myeongdong for my four days in Korea. I didn't have plans of buying too much at first but I ended up buying lots of face masks. Make up shopping is definitely a must when visiting Korea. Like every brand has a store on every street. I went literally every night to get my street food fix here. Love it!!!!
Crazy,Girls will go crazy in this street !! So many brands to shop around and they always have all kind of discounts !! Haha we almost bankrupt ! Be careful and don't go out of control ! reminder: please check the price of items you buy because sometimes they might mess up the prices of the products.

Great shopping and fresh street food,"This area of town is awesome! All of the street food was incredible. There were so many different options and everything was pretty fresh. There are also a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping in this area. This was one of our favorite streets in Seoul!"

Very crowded noisy street.,"Full of different kind of stores, with Lots of "" Beauty shops"" where the ladies are always yelling to offer their products.... Tennis shoes stores with outstanding designs , but very expensive A very popular, yet very affordable small restaurant where you must be there in line before 11 to get the Best ox soup I've ever eaten! Of course, many other restaurants, shops, convenient stores for a quick sándwich or for expensive fruits.and an underground Mall...At the end of this shopping area there is the Meyongdong Cathedral and an exchange House with very good rates."
Very crowded with tons of skincare shops,"Went there for the free hankok costume fitting for photo taking at the Seoul Global cultural Centre. It is very crowded on both weekdays and weekends. A lot of skincare and cosmetics shops. I printed out the discount voucher from the website but couldn't be used at the skincare shop despite the coupon says so. Prices for cosmetics and skincare are more or less the same as other shops in Seoul. Many good and reasonable eateries in Myeongdong. There is a very nice Dakgalbi in Myeongdong. It is a Korean dish with gochujang (chilli pepper paste) marinated diced chicken, stir-fried together with sliced cabbage, sweet potato, scallions, onions, perilla leaves, and ddeok (rice cake) together on a hot plate. You will see a long queue outside the shop and that is the one.Shopping is generally more expensive there especially at the underground mall. I bought a K-pop badges (4 pieces in a packet) at 10,000won and k-pop poster at 15,0000won after she gave me discount in the underground mall but when I walked past a push cart stall near the Seoul Global Cultural Centre building, it is selling only at 6000won for the badges and 12,000won for the k-pop poster . Thus please purchase at this push cart stall for K-pop products."
cosmetics paradise and places to eat,Lots of cosmetic shops and restaurants and street vendors for local food. Try the delicious street vendor food. Lotte department store is near by.The salespeople speak Mandarin for Chinese tourists. We exchanged Korea won in an upstairs FX place. It was nearly the same rate as xe.com. Exchange a little at the airport and the rest here. Compare different shops. Lots of places for food. There are also lots of stores to buy clothes.
"Myeongdong is nonstop, hyper-shopping.","Alright, so if you've got won, Myeongdong will happily take it from you. It is a labyrinth of stores, places to eat, more stores, a theater, and my favorite: street food. So if you're into skincare, you'll find your paradise in Myeongdong. All of the brand names are here: Olive Young, Atrium, Holika Holika, Skinfood. . . the list goes on. Honestly my only complaint is each alley of Myeongdong seems to have the same skincare shops on repeat. But if I'm honest with myself, I love it, too. There's also clothing stores, too, like Uniqlo, Forever 21, H and M, and more luxurious brands, like MGM and a few others. There's tons of restaurants. People will stand outside and guide you to them (some of them can be very tucked away!), others are right out in the open. Honestly, you just have to spin the bottle and pick a place - there's so many, you could eat a meal a day here, and it would probably take you a solid year to get through them all. Finally, if you wait until ~3-4PM, the streetfood vendors come out and oh my lord, I always think I've died and gone to heaven. I LOVE the streetfood here. My favorites are croissant fish bread, and a stall that sells waffles with ice cream. It's always packed, but the food's awesome. Eat out here, and be prepared to spend at least 20$ on food, you won't regret it. Myeongdong has something for everyone. The skincare lovers can drop 4$ on skincare products or 150$ in a single go, and likewise you can spend 10$ at a cheap store or $3,500 on a bag at MGM. It's all up to you. But go to Myeongdong for the atmosphere. You'll love it. And when you get bored, go over to the cat cafe or the dog cafe for a nice relaxing drink. You won't regret that, either!"
Shop! Eat! Sightsee!,Great place to buy cheap and good quality cosmetics. Eat the street food. And if you want luxury shopping lotte is just the next street. 
Shopping here!,"This is a shopping street! And it's pretty big street and a lot of choices to choose from!This place you can bargain, and make sure you do because the prices they display are high and expensive!Overall this place is crowded with people, and there's a lot of street food and street apparels! Make sure you go after winter to get non winter clothing!"

"
Something for everyone,"Myeongdong is like a nightmarket with street food mixed with designer brands and apparel with small shops, chain restaurants and many places that sell makeup and coffee. There are older people and younger people all mixed together and it is usually packed. If you like lively crowds or people watching, then Myeongdong is the place to be. I like it of course because I can sample the various snacks they have there and there is a wide variety. My wife likes it because the cosmetics are pretty well priced here and of course Myeongdong has her favorite stores Forever 21 and H&M. There is also a rather exhaustive list of restaurants available and I’d recommend that you research them before actually eating there. This place made each of my family members happy as it contains something for everyone so I consider it a great place."
Shopping haven!!!,"I used to stay in Myeongdong during my business trips for doing some shopping in the evenings. This place is a must visit for people who like shopping. There are so many stores with a wide variety of clothes, cosmetics on display. This place is mostly frequented by the Japanese tourists so there are many sushi joints also nearby."
Shopping and Enjoying Snack,"This Myeongdong Street is a Famous Spot for Shopping and enjoying Street Food/Snacks. We will find so many people from local people and also tourist. Here they can shopping for cosmetic, accesories, cloth, shorts, food, etc. Very Enjoying to go here while you are in seoul"
"""Most Happening Shopping Street""",The street is lively - combination of branded shops and night market-style stalls. Plenty of things to buy and eat.
The mecca of beauty products,"Number one on your shopping list when you come here: beauty products. Face masks, under eye gel patch, make up, you name it, they got it. All good quality in a bargain. Number two: those big sweet juicy strawberries, sold in small stalls outside in the middle of the road. So good. And cheap. Gives you energy to shop more. "
A must visit!,"Loved it! If you go to seoul, you must stop here. Bring a light backpack to carry all the items you buy. "
Lots to see!,"Lots of places to shop for clothes for the entire family. Many, many restaurants and street food vendors. Souvenir shops. Some shops are inside some are out along the street. We went in February when it was freezing cold, around 17 degrees F outside but the locals didn't seem to mind. The streets were still packed with people everywhere. "
Next visit I will stay near Myeongdong,"Apart from Cosmetic and clothes, I enjoy eating here, no need to worry about breakfast, lunch or dinner, very convenience when you travel on your own and didn't when you will get to eat. Myeongdong has every kind of food to offer."
Shopping - amazing! ,"Amazing shopping - would definitely recommend for beauty addicts!! Bit intimidating at first but once you get over that it's amazing - don't forget to bargain, although can be tricky as not everyone speaks English. "
Not good,"Very crownd, some shop have the same brand but different price. (With the same Inisfree lipstick, a shop sells 15000won, another shop sells 3000won). The staff always speak korean and chinese, they dont want to use english."
Korean cosmetics!,This area is a Korean cosmetics heaven. Very cool to walk around and get some great stuff - the storekeepers are very generous with free samples. Bring your passport for tax free shopping!
Lots of fun for skincare but gets crowded,"This place is hilarious- we bought about 8 bags each in 2 hours (!) You get all the mid level skincare brands here and sheet mask stores. there is a mask for everything, some v amusingly named. There are great little fashion and accessory shops off the main drags down the side streets, well worth exploring. It is best in the morning, it gets v crowded later in the day when the street vendors turn up "
never-ending shopping & street food paradise,"so many shops, so much street food, so many people! definitely worth checking out. this could be the only place you go shopping in Seoul & you wouldn't miss anything elsewhere."
Meh. ,It was ok I guess. Nothing special and no great deals but interesting if you're a people watcher. We found a fantastic restaurant but that's it. 
Best night shopping place,"On Myeongdong Street we could see the local activities both on the street and in the stores. We could see the sellers of Grilled Octopus, Oysters, Eels, Chicken and Pork, as well as Banana- choco Crepes, Chesnuts, Hotteok, Sweet Potatoes, Court Cracker, and Corn on the cob. We could taste everything there especially during cold winter time, it's warm and yummy.If we still wants some sweet after dinner in a close restaurant, we could enjoy Korean traditional dessert Pat Bingsu in Sulbing Myeongdong. What a wonderful place to look around!"
Cheap!!!,"If you are coming to korea and you need to buy some regards to your homeland friends you need to go to this place, because you can buy a lot of things in a good price."
Shop Til You Drop!,"This is one of the shopping mecca. Super crowded after 5pm. It caters to all budgets.

Adidas, New Balance to name a few. Coffee shops include Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts... CPK Restaurant. Tons of food carts selling snacks, desserts, candy... Street eating is quite popular here in Seoul. You can spend all day long to shop and eat here. Lol. You can also haggle if buying from street vendors. - Conveniently right by Subway Line 4, Myeongdong station, Exit #6, or 4 minutes walking to subway Line 2, Euljiro 1-ga station, Exit #6.There is a tourist information center located by Myeong-dong &Jungang-ro intersection where you can find brochures, pamphlets in English  "
Shopper's paradise,"Basically, everything you would want to find/buy in Seoul will be here. Wide range of cosmetic brands (popular ones like Etude, Nature Republic, Innisfree have several branches in this area so you can spot one almost at every turn). Some items may be selling at slightly cheaper prices in other markets (if that matters); otherwise for convenience, shop till you drop! Do try out the street food and drop by O'Sulloc for some good tangerine/green tea latte."
Good place for shopping and food,"I like this for food. Many nice places to eat. Thai food, Indian food, Italian and local . The church is good one as well. If you like street food this is the place to be. Very near to Westin so I could walk down! "

Amazing place to buy wonderful Korean skincare. We bought face masks and hand masks and LOADS more. Go in the morning, as the Chinese appear in the afternoon and you cannot move."
Great place to shop and spend a night shopping,"Very popular shopping street in Seoul. Many street eat outs also if you like korean food. Wide range of shops from street market to branded shops. You should be ready to walk a lot. Car parking is very difficult to get, using public will be better option but while finish of shopping you usually have to wait for you bus back home. "
Good street eats.,"Good street food, shops and stalls. Very busy but that is part of the appeal and you can easily push a few streets away it it quietens down. Lots of fried chicken and Korean BBQ places in the side streets and up little stair cases."

If you want to shop or eat, this is the place."
Favorite place in Seoul ;),"Two hours is never enough to explore & shop in Myeongdong haha. They have everything you want from top to toe, to fulfill your hunger, and watch a show. I always come here whenever I came to Seoul. "
Food and Shopping,"You can taste a variety of amazing food here, I couldn't find the local food they have in here (except for some special places). I don't know about other countries but in India Zara is looked upon as expensive, But in here that was expensive than Indian Zara prices but one of the cheapest stores in here."
Great place to eat and find anything,"A little expensive for regular shopping, since it's all about the known stores and brands. But it's a cool place to get high quality products, and definitely a good place to eat. You'll find all sort of restaurants and cafes, so be sure to go through all the streets and alleys, you won't be disappointed. Recommended: Cat cafe, Hello Kitty Cafe, Korean BBQ, etc."
Not so Korea,You can hear pretty much every language but mainly Japanese and Chinese. I thought I was in China rather than Korea. It is a great place to experience street food. 
Eat and buy,"A good place for eating and buying skin care, mark up cosmetic but quite clowded and less various product for selection."
Anything and everything,Great shopping area. You can truly find everything and not nearly as pricey as itaewon. Of course there are coffee shops everywhere. 
Cosmetics Shopping and eating local street food,"I went with a local so it was easy to jump from one shop to another. I bought at Hollika Hollika (very persuasive saleswomen and premium priced), Nature Republic. Try strawberry coated with some jelly and blackbean paste. "
Eat & Shop Eat & Shop,"Went there during Christmas, a really fun experience. There are so many street food, all are delicious and worth the price.

Only cosmetic products with Chinese-speaking people.,"Many cosmetic product stores and restaurants, most of the people inside could speak Chinese. It is recommended to visit there at night as the snack stalls are not opening at noon."
Crazy place to shop,This area has a lot of everything shopping like although there is a lot of chaos at times and some of the items are not great value for money. Worth visiting if you have a lot of time otherwise there are better things to see
everything in one place,a great place to shop in stores or get a good deal from a street vendor. at night you can buy all sorts of food from vendors
Lively Street market,The market comes alive after dusk when hawkers start setting up their stalls. You can have a variety of local Korean food and do your shopping as well. We found it to be a very safe place and you can even approach tourist officials who are in red vests for directions or help. It is a must visit place if you love shopping.
Great shopping...you can spend hours there!,The weather was miserable the day we went to the shopping street. It was cold and rainy and it was not fun walking around in it. There are a lot of stores and at all price ranges too.

Must on TO DO list.,"This place has a great vibe! Lots of food vendors, crazy amount of cosmetic shops all over the places, Even the shop sales person will give freebies to the street walkers, most of the shops pretty much had a great sale and best part is generous amount of samples you get at the time of your purchase:~)) .

Wonderful 😍,"It's fantastic and amazing area, I recommend to visit myeongdong in night & I will come back again.You can get there via Ⓜ through myeongdong "
my most favorite place in Seoul,"I purposely went to book a hotel that is very near this place. Myeongdong is a bustling place with shops open till late at night. The cosmetic shops are right beside each other. There are multiple shops of each brand. There are nice cafes and awesome shops to buy clothes, shoes and of course, cosmetics. Sales people are outside inviting crowds in and handing out free mask sheets. When you go inside to buy, they will dump even more freebies in your bag. They are also very honest because I went there and the cashier forgot to put an item. I went back and they gave it to me. No hassle. I spent a lot on Korean cosmetics which is very good for the skin. On the streets are all kinds of street food from seafood to noodles to ice cream. Every night we were in Seoul I was there. I even went in the morning. But I recommend going there in the evening. "
Lots of food and cosmetic shops and shopping,"There's alot of cosmetic shops, fashion shopping on footwear and also variety of restaurants that you will contemplate which one to try first."
Cheap and Nice,"I went there twice for shopping and eating. There's a lot of Korean cosmetics brand which is cheap and nice. When you buy something from those cosmetic shops, they also give you a lot of free cosmetics (tester or smaller version or up on you request) The foods are so nice and even open later than midnight. I like the Korean's chicken fried rice restaurant. It is so easy to reach this street."
Everything Seoul has to offer!,"Myeongdong has basically everything Seoul has to offer. From street foods, shopping street ranging from cosmetics, clothes to Kpop stuff. Near the evening, street vendors will setup their stalls in the middle of the street. U can find street-foods like egg bun, grilled squid, hotteok, jjajangmyeon etc. The price might be more expensive than the rest of Seoul though."
Place to buy nice souvenirs and clothes!,"Items could be somewhat expensive in here, though are still some street foods where u can try. There would be a ton of teens walking and crowded most of the time. "
Shopping paradise for women,"If you love beauty stuff, this is the place for you! I can shop here for days! Everything is easily accessible!"
Worth Going Just For The Madness of It All,"It is a labyrinth of clothing stores, makeup, restaurants, and cafes. With tons of street vendors seeling knock off good and street food. Although I didnt buy anything while walking around here it is worth a look to just walk around and see all the flashing neon lights rising up the sides of every building competing with each other in who flashes the brightest. The chaos of locals and foreginers alike shopping and enjoying themselves. You may evem get the opportunity to see some people walking around in dog, cat, or Pikachu costumes advertising thier businesses."
Average place,"The place n street market is ok but namdaemun's better. Im staying at Cheonggyecheon-ro, Jongno-gu, which is a walking distance from the myeondong street market. We can't haggle the price with stuffs even though we bought a lot (for eg in namdaemun market we bought 10 socks n free 1 sock however no such thing here in myeondong market) as the shop vendor refused to give a free sock, I dont know about the other sock stalls but the price here for sock varies from 1000 won to 2500 won. I would suggest to stay here if u r with frens as the street market is big n fill with shophouses selling beauty products."
Shopping and Foods,"This area is good for shopping cosmetic items. You can get very good discount for branded cosmetic items. You may find same brand has more than 1 shop in this area. Sometime they are giving different discount in different shop. Different discount also happen in different day. Many restaurants in this area, reasonable price and taste good."
Very Interesting Area,"Visit this area in the evening. A lot of shops, clothing, shoes etc. both international and local brand. Variety of Food Street, makes you want to try all.Easy to reach Myeongdong by subway eventhough we have to change the train to get there."
Everything is marked up,"Do not buy stuffs from the street vendors. Their items are marked up at least 3 times higher than the same item in other places. We were quoted 30000won for a bag pack. The same bag pack costs only 10000 won at express bus terminal, ewha uni, gangnam. Same goes to the street food and cosmetic. "
Shop till you drop!,"This is fabulous for shopping- especially Korean cosmetics, clothing, shoes, nick-nacks etc. Its all there! In the shops and the street vendors. Bargaining is expected (expect 20%) - calculators at the ready!"
Shopping heaven,"This is a must visit place. It is really a shopping heaven where you can shop for all the cosmetics and skin care products. Visited myeongdong a lot of times whenever I am in Seoul (I would go as and when I have the time). Apart from cosmetics and skin care products, you can also shop for other products such as ginseng, clothings, bags, hats, albums, shoes, souvenirs and many many more. There are also a lot of cafes (selling bingsu, etc) and food cart selling different types of food (e.g. egg bread, strawberry mochi, strawberries, roasted chestnuts, and many more). I realized that there are also a lot of new shops up in the shoppinh street.There are some money changers. The money changer might not display sgd as one of the currencies that they have. So just ask them, most of them might have it. The rate that they offer might differs. Ask around at different money changer (if you have the time and energy) and get the better rate. Overall, very nice shopping place. Love it!!"
I love korea street foood!,Not a cheap place for street food..Yess u can nego with seller to buy shirt/sweater/etc! Very very super crowded everyday! 
Happy with shopping.,A lots of cosmetics it's a happiness of girls. Haha. You can stay in Namsan town for walking to Myeongdong Market. It's comfortable for walking and seeing around There.

Great place to shop around in Seoul!!!,"Had been living nearby Myeongdong for one year and revisit this place 6 months ago!5-10mins walk to Namdaemun and 20-25mins walk to Dongdaemun! you can find many cute and cheap stuff here include earrings at Goyanggi꼬양이 n very yummy Jjambong짬뽕 at 홍콩점 at reasonable price around 6000 korean won.The best 짬뽕 in town!Shops open around 10.30am and losed around 10.30pm but will extend a little bit to 11pm on weekends. There is a also cinema here and can grab cheap ticket for the earliest movie! If u visit myeongdong at night there will be many small stalls along the streests selling korean style snacks, accessories and clothes!if you never try korean corn, it can be very different as the texture is sticky and soft instead of the crunchy and sweet we normally have! After all Myeongdong is the best place for everything!!"
Good Shopping Heaven,Managed to find a lot of interesting things.The price are reasonable if you manage to negotiate.Korean food at this area are good too.
Crowded,"If you wanted to shop in crowded shops and crowded streets, then this is the place. If you want to avoid the crowds, go in the morning. "
Average place to shop,Plenty of shops had sales. Mostly clothing and ma keep stores here. There are a few interesting statues to take pictures besides.
Absolutely Beautiful,"Wonderful Place to wander around and explore in. Hundreds and hundreds of shops, restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and more. Brightly lit, though quite crowded, it's certainly a place you should stop as a tourist if you're looking to shop. The hotels in the area are also all very helpful, stop by the front desk at any (I stopped by Loisir right outside the metro station - great staff) and be treated to some helpful tips and directions."
Alot of beauty skin care shops and food!,"we had a great time walking around in myeongdong. One after another skin care products from holika, innisfree, nature republic, tonymoly etc. Also tons of street vendors, I like the ones that sells tornado potato. I prefer to eat egg bun(gyeran bbang) and fish cake on a stick (eomuk guk?) in namdaemun market. Also, It gets crowded and just be careful with your bag. "
A Lot of A Lot of Stuff,"Briefly paseed thru the market during a short stay in Seoul. This market had a wide varietry of foods, produce, seafood, clothes, fabrics and so much more. Every time I turned down an alley I found a new type of product or food. They have every kind of seafood eels to octopus. If food curious and adveturous, you can sample the many Korean street foods and traditional dishes. If a crafter, they have all you need. Don't be affraid to haggle price as you can get some great deals. "
Great for tourists!,"I love this street! There are tons of stores and shops that all offer different things--from tourist-y souvenirs to clothes to handmade dishes and arts. You will never walk away empty-handed, and the prices are always right!"
Shopping mecca in Seoul,This is one of the many shopping districts in Seoul. There are a numerous selection of shopping for all ages. Most of the facial products can be found here. This place is often crowded with locals and foreigners alike.
Heaven for shopping,This market is heaven for cosmatics.. You will get all brands. All brands are good. Korean cosmetics are famous for skin care and Make up Brands.wow..I would like to come again.☺
Just go!,"accessibility - yes (just a short walk from Myeondong train station)Price - for the budget conscious, this is a good place to go especially if you are looking for cosmetics! half the price compare to Philippine prices. as in! "
Never failed to buy things,"Never come out empty handed. Good place to find all your needs. From food,cosmetic ,etc... one stop place that cannot be miss!"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Definitely a great shopping paradise for all tourists.You may get everything from there. You don't have to find a good restaurant in Seoul, and I am sure the shopping street may bring ""sweetness"" to your tastebuds.Prices generally were cheap and would suggest travel in group and can share among the foods along the streets."
Crazy street and lots tourist,"I was in Myeongdong last year (2015) September, and was kind of surprised by the area of how many tourists are there, especially people who speak Chinese. Almost all stores that I visit and even the sales people standing outside giving out the samples, they all speak Chinese. To me, I think they do a pretty hard sale, following you around the store, super friendly with you, giving out bunch good words to their products. I am not a beauty experts that I usually just trust the brand that I know, so I am really skeptical on every claims that they are making since everything is well packaged. Anyhow, I still ended up buying some lotions face masks...It can add up expensive that I am not sure what I am paying for. (expensive than the normal US drug store brand, but cheaper than the duty free shop brand). But, they seem working well on me so far. No scary breakout yet. So, the conclusion is that, taking away my skepticism, I had a pretty fun time shopping in Myeongdong."
Shop shop shop,"For those who are looking for korean cosmetics,it is a good place to go. I think this place is quite complete. The price is also reasonable and lots of choice. Visit this place a bit earlier so that you are not trapped in a crowd. "
Shopping street for everyone,"Enjoy your shopping here! At this street, there are everything you need from street food, cosmetics, shoes bags, clothing, and home decorative items. It is a place for everyone."
great shopping street,i love the street food and the shopping area. there are a lot of great shops and restaurants around. although crowd can be too thick at times.
Soak in the atmosphere ,Myeongdong is a must go and see to experience for 1st timer visit to Seoul. That area has become too crowded for comfort due to the at least 200 Street food stalls. Although one is able to pick up various brands of cosmetics as well as sample local creatively done street food there. But how is one able to enjoy street food while standing and try to avoid beening pushed or be an obstruction? .There is hardly room to move around due to the narrow space and large crowd. Good experience though for 1st timer there.Just be brave and enjoy.
Area for beauty products,"Most of the stores sell beauty products, some brands such as etude, nature republic, faceshop, innisfree have its store in every alley or street. Most of the sales speak multilingual, mandarin and japanese are most commonly. Street foods stalls were open since morning and more stalls open in the evening. "
Must go!,"It is an obligatory for foreigners to come here, who never heard of Myeongdong right! It's like your Korea trip is incomplete without visiting Myeongdong, a shopping heaven and cramp with peoples! lol. So many things u can check out here, like gazillion cosmteic shops, trying Korean street foods, famous Korean boutiques, acccessories, Cafes etc. Almost everything can be found here. Since I stay nearby Myeongdong, I came here every night, eventho I have nothing to buy."
Place for cosmetic craze....,"According to my wife and my daughter, this place is a must because they have all you can imagine for cosmetic...all brand both international & Korean brand and its cheap."
"Nice to buy souvenirs, but not very authentic","This neighborhood was without any doubt authentic at some point in time.Right now it is a street filled with tourist shops and shoppers traps.I would only recommend this street if you were to look for souvenirs.For a real taste of authentic old town, go somewhere else."
Wish it opened longer,"This was a very interesting and fun part of town. My favorite part were the food vendors! Make sure you bring cash to enjoy the many treats available for purchase. There was a variety of stores, with the majority focusing on beauty products. I arrived around 8:30pm and stores were already starting to close. I was disappointed. "
The best place for Shopping ,I went twice on my visit to seoul and never get tired of shopping at this place.You get many options and different products.Beauty products are natural most of them and super good.
"If you like street food and cosmetics, this is the place for you","This place is buzzing with street vendors, name brand cosmetics shops, and hordes of clothing stores. I personally liked this place to people watch, enjoy the various street food and the general buzz of the area. While the restaurants aren't really the best here (in my humble opinion), there are some reliable Korean chain restaurants in the area and really wonderful street food stalls. It is worth a visit....even just to walk around and feel the energy. "
Shop and Go Crazy!,"Absolutely Love this place! Especially when there are sales going on....we came back here 3 times i believe.. and I never got tired of it! Get lost in every corner and find yourself in a different part of the city, and look for those obscure shops that has unique items! Great place for Korean cosmetics and beauty products!"
Heaven of korean street food and cosmetic,This is a street for food lovers and you can found few cute things and there is music performance with some kitchen stuff.
Everything you want and more,"A must try place especially the cat cafe and the street foods. In winter, it's especially nice to enjoy the area as all the street foods will definitely provide warmth and cozy feeling. Shopping wise, it's the center of all shopping you want for most stuff. "
Streetfood everywhere,"Lots of delicious street food!!! Also a perfect place to buy souvenir for family or friends. also lots of make up store such as: Face Shop, innisfree, skin food, beyond, etc. should by your make up here, it's cheaper than in my country. and also there's cute line stuff at LINE STORE!! :):)"
Shopping paradise,Good for shopping but very crowded as I went on Christmas eve but it's a good place to hang out and try street food
Every Korean cosmetic brand is here,lots of free mask being distributed to entice you to go into the shop. No purchase is needed. Food is on the 2nd floor so don't just look on the ground level.
Visit Myungdong :),"When you think of a big city, what image flashes through your mind? How do you feel about crowds of people, fast speed, or delicious food. Those are just symbol of Myungdong in Seoul, Siuth Korea.  Myungdong is lively city. There are many young people and tourists in Myungdong. The young people are energetic and tourists are very busy because they have spots tour. They cannot do anything slowly. The place many people are always many delicious food.  Do you wnat to meet many young people or tourists? Do you wnat to experience a lively city? Do you want to eat good food? Then visit Myungdong, you are going to love it."
Amazing place,"Bought a great suitcase at a very reasonable price. Ate in the nearby food court, amazing efficiency. Do not go there if you are a shopaholic. There is so many things to buy.  "
Shopping place,Interesting place to do shopping or just to hang around and to see locals cooking some street food. A great number of different shops and cafes
A MUST to visit in Korea,"This is my 4th time in Korea. Every visit I will visit Myeongdong Shopping Street. This year i choose a hotel near Myeongdong Shopping Street and stay there for 5 days. I have visited Myeongdong Shopping Street every night for the past 5 days. Do not give a miss if you visit Korea. Outstanding shopping area with lots of shops, street foods and restaurants. Get ready you wallet and spend."
People everywhere,"If you don't like crowds, don't come here. A normal night here is like NYE at Times Square. A million people jammed into streets lined with retail stores and restaurants and little food cart stalls. It is an experience that you have to do in Seoul."
busy shopping street,"my second visit to seoul and found ourselves in myeong dong for at least 3 nights for shopping. whole district of skincare shops and clothing boutiques. walk further and you will find lotte dept store and shinsaegae. it is a nice district to stay in during a holiday but I find that certain things eg. street food is a little more expensive than the university areas. all in all, a fun place to shop! you can easily shop in myeong dong the whole day and visit namsan tower nearby."
Shopping spree!,"A place you can shop for cosmetics and clothing, enjoy the street food and having a good atmosphere within the vicinity. A place that is always buzzing with people both locals and tourists. Never skip this place while you are there!"
Excellent street food,"I didn't come here for the shops. I came here for the street food, fresh juices, food on a stick, food in a cup, even jap jie noodles in a cup, and the cutest socks in the world!"
A great place to hang out and SHOP!,"Myeongdong is a must when coming to Korea. It's a shopaholics heaven. There are department stores on one side, (Three, to be exact) and streets and streets full of stores and food vendors on the other. (Be sure to bring a lot of cash because there are a lot of crazy and delicious street food and they don't accept credit cards!)  My friends and I shopped from morning to night. I am a major shopaholic, and the only problem for me was that almost every store closed at 10. I wanted to shop more :,( But overall, it was really fun!"
earliest worm gets the best worm!,"be there early morning, around 8am as some shops open this early. first customer gets the best deals so that you can buy more and set the 'luck"" of the entire day :)"
Lots of things to see,"This is a pretty big place and it is quite crowded even in winter. Hold on to your small ones because it would be difficult to find them if you ever lose them. It's a great place to hang out with friends as this place provides a lot of cafes, restaurants and street food. Definitely a place to go to. For some of the more popular restaurants, make sure you arrive at 11am, otherwise you'll have a difficult time finding seats."
Shopaholic heaven,"You can find almost everything here from facial products to clothings, accessories, foods and cafe they have everything here was here on a weekend and the crowd was crazy. "
Cosmetics and Street Food,Lots of food vendors and the same cosmetics shops over and over again. You can walk up and down these streets for hours. Lots of great deals too. Great place for Korean cosmetics. Full of tourists and can get very crowded.
Great street,"Great street! Very near our hotel. Love the food vendors! Restaurants, coffee shops, beauty stores, convenient stores everywhere! So much great stuff to eat, look and do! Lots of good vibe with place!"
Facial products!!!!,"Is the place to go to buy as they have a lot of tourist discount but also due to that there is a lot I mean A LOT of China people and as they flock in all the samples are not ""free"" anymore as you need to buy something before they give you any samples. The street food is a little overprice but it tourist spot so naturally the prices are higher."
Good shopping,"I went there twice during my stay in Seoul. I speak very little Korean and zero Mandarin, so I felt pretty confused here when the sales people talked to me in Mandarin constantly. It is busy and full with tourists. I love all the street food like deep fried crab, LOBSTER yes!, Octopus skewers, fresh pomegranate juice, fruits, etc. Also, the clothes, shoes, etc are very fashionable, lots to see. Since I am a big fan of BigBang i bought hats from a street vendor that gave me some discount LOL Enjoy Myeongdong! it is awesome!!"
Paradise of cosmetics,Different kinds of cosmetics available along the street. Prices are affordable and lots of promotions going on. Must visit !
"If you have budget for Fashion, Go for it","for cloths shopping, and shows at night, this is a street with the last trendy fashion if you are in SEOUL for Shopping "
Reminiscent of German Fussganger Zones,"The Myeongdong shopping area in dowtown Seoul is very much like the pedestrian shopping zones of most medium to large cities in Europe, with many of the same chain stores. One difference is the crowds that are like Marienplatz in Munchen during the Christmas season ... on a Tuesday in July."
Korean Cosmetic Heaven,"If you are fond of Korean cosmetics, then this is the best place to shop (but there are other shops and places to eat, too). The atmosphere is very stylish and hip."
Shoppers Paradise and Hell,"A lot of my visitors to Korea are pulled like a magnet towards Myeongdong, swayed by the tales of cosmetic freebies. Sometimes I manage to talk them down, but mostly they ignore the plain facts that the kinds of stores found there are on any high street in Korea and they all hand out freebies.It is also bizarrely famous for its restaurants, but if your scale of quality lends itself to overpriced, over-cooked, over-fancy, then you are definitely in the right place."
favorite place,"Been here twice. Sept 2013 and recently last Dec 2015. The place is complete from food, fashion, make-up and more. My guesthouse is just a 3 min walk to Myeongdong so every night I went here. Definitely one of the my favorite place in Seoul"
Put Your Best Face Forward,"A gazillion beauty shops and if you're looking to buy some facial products, this will be your best bet. Though street food are available here, I very much enjoyed those found in Insadong or Dongdaemun more. "
Cold and Variety,Since we stay near by so we had visited almost daily during our Tour trip; we took Korean Strawberry; Baked Sweet Potato; we buy cosmetic and specially LINE Store
Tourist and shoppers hell,"I'm not quite sure about the attraction of Myeongdong. Food? There are a few good restaurants but nothing that really stands out. Shopping? There are a few good stores, but nothing that I can't get anywhere else in Korea. When I first came to Korea 5 years ago, Myeongdong had a larger variety of stores and restaurants. It was a place you could go on a date, watch a movie, walk around, do some shopping or chat at a cafe. Now it is an over crowded tourist trap. The big cosmetic stores really killed the joy of this place. It seems like all the stores sell the same thing, and it is the same cosmetic stores in every direction, which you can get almost anywhere in Seoul. And the worst part is this shopping street is very crowded. If you do have to cross this off your list of places to visit, then the are a few things that I would recommend, Myeongdong Kalguksu restaurant, the Catholic Cathedral and Ouga Korean BBQ restaurant."
Non-stop Shopping,"Literally! Shops open in the morning until late at night. It is packed in the evenings with store employees having different gimmicks to attracts customers. With beauty shops (IMHO) as the most number in this area. Clothes, jewellery and souvenir shops, both international and Korean are everywhere. Cafes and restaurants are also available but try some street foods, they are cheap and delicious. Just be careful when walking through the crowd because sometimes cars and motorbikes drive through the sea of people. I was luck enough to see the Kpop group when they had a meet and greet in one of the shops."
Great shopping,"Its a very good place to shop and eat! There are a major variety of street food and shops. Although, the variety of things to shop are for girls and yuppies, but its still alright. "
Tourists and Shoppers heaven!,"Surrounded by shops, shopping malls, street foods and local korean restaurants, and easy access to metro, airport bus and taxi, I think it is perfect for 1st timer in Korea. However shops around there do not open early, so if you are stay in that area, breakfast selection is limited."
Fun place to shop and eat,"The number of options to eat and shop are almost overwhelming. The bright neon signs and the shop keepers hollering at you to enter their shops are quite a sight. It can be fun exploring among this vibrant crush of people, if you know what you're getting into. I would definitely recommend going at least once."
Great shopping! ,"I practically came here at least 3 times during my 3-weeks stay in Seoul. There are lots of shops, almost all the facial/ cosmetic brands are here. Many local clothing brands can also be found here. There are also trolley stalls in the middle of the streets selling the latest fashion at very affordable prices. If you want to have some streetfood, you will be spoilt for choices here too. Seoul has a lot of coffee chains and you will definitely see them at myeongdong. Even if you are not buying anything, join the never ending crowds and window shop!"
hip and happening place,was there during the countdown. there were people everywhere. a good festive mood. there were lots of shops and eateries along the many lanes. very easy to get around. There is also a subway right at the entrance. .
Shopping Heaven,"This is indeed a shopping heaven.. Especially for ladies.. Beauty products are really cheap there and definitely a ""must buy""! Will definitely visit again."
LOTS OF THINGS TO SEE & EAT,"Went there recently to check out the shopping and see that there are lots of things to buy: fashion, cosmetic etc. Local food too and also Western fast food. One could spend an entertaining day here for shopping and eating...."
Great Street food and even better shopping and night clubs,"Went here Xmas 2015 with my GF. Great place to spend a full day walking around and enjoying yourself. They have a cafe where you can go in and there are cats everywhere for you to pet....YES, real cats! lol"
Great for shopper!,"Staying near this street, so only walking distance from my hostel. Many things can be found here, anything kpop, socks, keychains, coats, anything! And the street foods are yummy...just go here if you are in seoul. "
Be a good tourist and come here!,"Not really a ""must-go"" attraction, but you should definitely check this place out! Although many shops and restaurants can be found elsewhere, the atmosphere is lively, especially at night with the food stalls. It is very big, as in one afternoon is not be enough to visit everything (if you're into shopping). If you're not a shopper, you can walk around the neighborhood in a little over an afternoon no problem. Mornings are pretty boring here, you should come here at around 2 pm (when the food stalls start coming and setting up in the middle of the street) and spend the rest of your day here. Speaking of food stalls, you should definitely be careful of what you eat. We visited here during hot summer days and one of my friends bought fruit juice and got a stomach ache. I guess because of the heat, the juices went bad. For hot food, it is OK! But if you're unsure (like me), watch the person make the food and ask for the food that just came out of the stove so you know it didn't stayed in the heat for a long time. Another great thing about this place is that there are walking ""Information guide"". They wear red t-shirts and give out maps to tourist. If you're struggling to find your way and happen to come across these lovely ladies/gents, they can surely help you find your way back. There are 2 subway stations, so access to this shopping district is pretty convenient."
Shopping paradise,Went down to Myeondong shopping street for 2 night as last minute I need to get something from thereThis shopping street is very accessible by subway and is always packed with both local Koreans and touristsEnjoyed the street food and the ambience specially like to walk in the street during cold winter periodThere is a MCM flagship store in the area and would be great for people who like to get MCM stuff and they also offered tax refundRecommeded to visit during the night where most of the stores are opended and crowded with peopleDr E. Chow
The Place to Go for Shopping in Seoul,"I always have to go to Myeongdong when I'm in Seoul. No matter how short my visit is, I make it a point to go here for all the shopping necessities. All the Korean cosmetic brands are here and multiple stores of the same brand at that! There are also so many shoe stores where it's easy to get sucked in to buy the latest models at great prices. Don't forget that anything above KRW30,000 (USD 30) entitles you to GST so shop shop shop. Aside from the shopping, there's also so much food in Myeongdong... Restaurants, coffee shops and street food too. Come here with plenty of cash and an empty stomach and you will surely enjoy your visit. Just be very careful since there's so many people. I have actually lost my wallet here and whether I misplaced it or someone actually took it, I'll never know but it pays to be extra cautious. "
A shopping experience with a twist!,"We went here just for a wander around and to soak up some atmosphere. The shops are the same ones you get all over Korea and there are multiples of each one! Whilst not too keen on shopping, we did love the buzz of the area and most of all the street food! It's cheap, plentiful and you can have some banter with the stall holders. Definitely worth a trip or two!"
The Ladies will love it,Lots of facial product stores and woman's clothing stores for the ladies but not a lot of stores appealing to males.The street food that rolls out in the afternoons and into the night is a must try
OK for shopping but great for street food!,"The area is a criss-cross of quite narrow, semi-pedestrian streets. Plenty of restaurants and clothes shops with a few more touristy shops but these are heavily (HEAVILY) outnumbered by skincare shops. I had no idea the Koreans were quite so obsessed. Realistically, I would guess that anywhere between a third and a half of the shops in the area focus on skincare. Still an interesting place to wander, especially at night when the pretty lights go on and the street vendors come into their own. The street food here is fantastic, fresh scallops, steak, kebabs, strawberries, waffles; barrows selling a huge range of delicious food. Don't come for a snack, come for a meal!"
Very fun! Good food,My family loves roaming around this area! My kids are young and this was the first place where we stayed on the streets beyond 10pm. There were lots to look at and lots of good food on the streets. The streets are crowded but had great atmosphere. 
Must see it,"Interesting part of seoul. Good local crafts. Try to go into the back streets for some great food! Remember it is a tourist area. If you want to shop, best to go to the shopping centre near Bongeunsa Temple "
Good place to shop!,"Make no mistake, it's not the cheapest for shopping. What I liked about it though is that it has several stores to choose from. During our visit it was raining, so we didn't enjoy hopping from one store to another. "
One of my favourite shopping places in Seoul,"You can find cheap and trendy finds in this area..from accessories, tops, bottoms, shoes and all sorts of cosmetics! Vendors can charge you really high especially at night so I advise you to visit the small shops because they have cheaper and more unique items. Also, never shop here on December 24 because the street is super CROWDED. Everyone is doing their last minute Christmas shopping so better go before the 24th or after Christmas! Enjoy!"
Definitely a must visit place,"If you are not a shopping person you can still come here as along the street there are many food selling to try. If you are, well this is a place you can find anything you want :)"
Shopping banaza,There was so many vendors sellings all sorts of goods from wallets to shoes to good. All competivelly priced and friendly pepople. 
A search for some clothes,"This area is a great shopping zone with many shops and malls. However if you are plus sized, this may not be the place for you snce the trendy clothes are for the skinny or slim cut... Largest sized pants are size 40.However, if you are small to medium built, this will be one of your places for clothes.Being a shopping district, you can also find other items you may fancy including many brands, but you will need to take your time.Lotte world also has its shopping centers here."
Very crowded and interesting shopping site,"Myeondong is very crowded most of the time. Esp on public holidays and weekends. Lots of interesting street food, cosmetics shop. A must go for travellers visiting Seoul "
Shopping heaven,"Oh where to start . If clothes and skin care are your thing this place is amazing .Brand name stores such as Zara , H & M , uniqlo as well as endless small shops selling Korean made / styled clothing . I found Zara cheaper than in Australia but uniqlo more expensive . The are hundreds of skincare stores . Split up your purchases as they give you samples every time you buy something . They do give you more if you purchase a lot , but I found spending $100 or $200 made no difference , so you are better off buying in two lots ."
A world of Cosmetics,"Taking the metro , there you are right in the shopping center. An old theatre with hundred shops linking to each other full of cosmetics from head to toes. Nothing special , very exciting.Just I happened to see a traditional wedding show perform to attract travelers is the only thing which attracts me.Otherwise it is just another cosmetic shopping which the Cosmetic Manufacturers made millions on their products; an attraction to Asian women in countries nearby."
So Much To See!!,"So many western options and many make up stores! Definitely change your money in this area. The rates are great. I got 178.5 when the rate at the time was around 181. I mean at the airport it was 163.5...so yeah! This is an exciting place to be, it is full of life and busy! Many coffee shops as well!"
Definitely worth a visit at the end of a day,We sort of stumbled on Myeongdong and glad we did. Was good to see the famed shopping of Seoul and try some street food. All very condensed and we were out before we knew it but worth a visit and go hungry
Too crowded,This place is just too crowded. If you are planning to go here to shop at the beauty shops I think you would be better off if you shop elsewhere since these beauty shops can be found all over Seoul.
Loud and lots of cheap junk,If you're from Europe of the USA there is very little here to interest you. Clothes will all be too small for adults and there is an over abundance of junk clothes and makeup stores. At the other end of the scale you have very expensive Korean department stores such as Lotte and Hyundai. If you really must visit try and get in and out early before the mass hordes of younger Asian tourists arrive.
Shop til you drop,"What this place is, are rows and rows of shops selling cosmetics to cafe to massages services to apparels. You can most probably spend the entire day here and still have not come close to checking out each and every store. It doesn't help that across the street is lotte and shinsege where the shopping continues. Girls and women who are into Korean skin care and cosmetics, look no further. If you have only one place you could go, this is it. Boys and men not swayed by the k craze, park yourself at any one of the many pubs and bars in the area with a book or a fully charged tablet. The shops are by no means unique. If you are not familiar it can all get pretty confusing as you leave an Auritaum shop turn a corner and there is another Auritaum shop. Repeat that with innisfree, holika holika, nature Republic, vdl, etude house, skin food. The list goes on and on. I would also like to high that if you like the UK brand Lush, you can find it here. Finally, there are also plenty of massage parlour in the area . This is good to know when your feet are barking at you after a full day of shopping. Only drawback is shopping is out in the open which could be inconvenient when it rains or snow."
Poppin!,"This shopping area was so busy especially with the holiday season. Tons of restaurants and shopping! But make sure to eat at restaurants only if there are a lot of people. We went to 1-2 restaurants that were quite empty and the food was not up to par.I can't imagine driving and parking nearby so def take the subway or taxi.If you're into the facial masks cosmetics, make sure to stop by each one as you can easily get a bunch of free samples. A lot of the sales staff would be standing outside and they'll speak Korean, Chinese or English to get your attention."
You can find everything here!,"If you're visiting Seoul, going to Myeongdong is a must! And 1 visit would never be enough. You can find almost everything here, from make-up, clothes (from super cheap one till high-end brand), delicious street foods, cute accessories etc etc. you can also come to Myeongdong for sightseeing because everything is just interesting. It will super crowded at night esp on the weekend, but thats just interesting part of Myeongdong! For you, K-Pop lovers, you can buy cheap albums and merch in Myeongdong Underground shopping. "
Not My Cup of Tea,"Let me clarify my review title, I love the location on Myeongdong if staying in Seoul. However, I do not necessarily like Myeongdong in particular. You can find some pretty good restaurants, but everything else is just average. The shopping experience is just one of claustrophobia. "
Beauty shopping heaven!,"Samples galore! Korean beauty houses like Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, TonyMoly, TheSaem and so many more all have multiple stores in this little shopping area. It gets crowded quick, so better to get started earlier in the day (before lunch). Most stores will be handing out samples during peak hours, either in your shopping basket, or directly into your hands as you walk in. When you buy items, don't be shy - ASK for samples too! Worse thing that can happen is a polite decline, which rarely happens.Also, lots of amazing street food vendors too - red bean fish croissants, tornado chips, egg-in-sweet-bread, deep fried squid, fresh strawberries, just to name a few!"
"The to be for shopping, wating, and people watching","Our visit to Myeongdong was one of the highlights of our vacation. There is a certain buzz about this place. Be prepared to spend a whole day here as there is plenty to do. We shopped, enjoyed a good galbi bbq, watched the 'Nanta' play, and gobbled down street food. The outdoor market that starts in late afternoon is another must. We did find the prices to be a tad costly for street food. "
Retail paradise!,"This is sensory overload - the sights, sounds and smells are so intoxicating! The sheer variety of shops and their wares, is mind-boggling. I made several trips back to this area, and still didn't feel that I had done it justice. Plenty of reasonably-priced Korean restaurants, so you can shop and eat without leaving the area. Particularly good to visit at night (I visited in winter), when the street vendors prepare and sell a huge array of local foods, some of which makes for good souvenirs."
Fun place!,"I loved seoul and this place made it fun! Good buys and bargains, easy access. You can spend a whole day there and have fun!"
"Best Place To Shop For Skin Care, Toiletries & Cosmetics","Many shops that specialises in skin care, toiletries and cosmetics. The shops offered various discounts for tourist and tax refund (min. W30,000 per receipt). Moreover, there are numerous eating places, a dog cafe and 2 cat cafes. There are also many money changers that gave very good rates without commission. A tourist shopping paradise."
Very crowded during weekend and perfect place if you try to find cosmetic,"Be careful if you go to this area during weekend. Very crowded! However, you will find a lot of nice food stalls along the street and it's worth to try some!"
Loads of Beauty Retailers,Many Choices of beauty products and eateries; lots of lots of people - Visited Two Two Chicken Twice here...
"Shopping mecca, wear good shoes.",This is the place to buy all the things! I have to have had a healthy meal before I can face the crowds but there is a fun sense of excitement running through the air with everyone looking for deals. 
big name brands and loads of people,visit for the crowds and the numerous skincare shops. do note that the shops do not open till late so going in the early evening is ideal. 
Everything's here,It's a shopping area with tourist attraction around. Is a nice location to get a hotel here too. A lot of restaurants are here and also those Korea cosmetic brand. The Nanta theater is also located in the middle of Myeongdong. Staffs in those shops are helpful however some of them may be rude also.
Shopping and street food paradise,Don't miss this place for ultimate local shopping and street food. The crowd was incredible and yet you can still get good bargains and trendy stuff!!
Shopping street,"Experience⭐⭐⭐Prices⭐⭐⭐⭐Food⭐⭐⭐Street shopping, street food, street views and lots of walking. That's Myeongdong for you. For shopping centres, go to Dong Dae Moon. Here, it's not recommended for families with young children and only for people wanting che street food"
Absolutely Fantastic,"You will be shocked by the crowd walking here and there for shopping. Throughout the night, people just shopping crazily until after midnight. You can find lots of shops for fashion, cosmetics, shoes and electronic items. Apart from shops, there are also street stalls competing with each others. Lots of restaurants and food stalls are also there creating a great atmosphere of excitement."
Great place for shopping!,"Definitely great place for shopping till 11pm. Also, there are a lot of food and beverage variety in the area. "
Shopping belt,A lot of cosmetic shops along the shopping belt. The sales persons are very friendly and knowledgeable to introduce the right things for you. 
Comes alive at night,"It's a great place to be even if you do not use cosmetics like me. Awesome shopping street where you can get lots of free samples (love the snail masks I got) and there's a huge Daiso store. Was amazed at how I went inside the Nanta theatre for a show and when I came out at 7pm, Myeongdong had completely transformed and come alive with endless street food stalls. Food paradise!"
Women's Paradise,I noticed that there are a lot of shops for cosmetic products than clothings and food so I guess it is a Women's place. :)
Shopping paradise,The shopping street was so big that we went there almost every night with the useful help of the hotel shuttle bus. Their we do shopping eating and drink and shopping again endlessly. The street food is delicious and cheap.
Touristy but worth the visit,"Lots of stores and outside kiosks. Definitely worth the walk-through and shopping time, if that is what you are looking for. The food carts/tables offer some very good street food, with decent prices and variety. "
Crazy crowds,Went to shopping district in December 25th! Crowds were crazy! If you don't like crowds stay away! Lots of lights and many shops for everything you are looking for. Walking difficult ! Food vendors everywhere !!
Lots of Fun! ,"You can drink, eat, be merry and shop till you drop. It's fun and loud. It's near with many other touristic places, so you can combine it easily. "
Street food overload,Insanely busy place with streams of street food vendors and retail shops further behind. Food was good but you are left carrying around your trash afterwards because rubbish bins don't exist on this street - bizarre. Shop owners are not pushy and can browse freely and in own time.
Shop till you drop,"The Myeongdong area has alot of big name/brand shops. Come here to watch how the Koreans are dressed up. The cosmetic stalls' shop assistants are happy to pass you some free samples when you pass by. When you do buy some of their products, they will give discounts and throw in freebies to make you one happy shopper. Its a joy to shop in Myeongdong. For some special lunchbox shaking experience, head to Miss Lee Cafe.Of course there are many other places in Seoul which the locals go to, such as Hongik, Ewha, Edae, Dongdaemun etc."
"Myeongdong shopping, theatre, street food, restaurants","A great area to visit for street food, cosmetic shopping as well as big/ little shops with clothing, souvenirs, handbags & many other things. I would recommend the ""Nanta"" show. Also check out many little kiosks at the subway station underground. The restaurants were great. Eating street food was an experience but the ones we tasted was just ok. Did love the Rose shaped ice cream--that was yummy!"
"Plenty of street food, restaurants and shopping","If you visit the street during day time, you can find a lot of shops for shoes, clothing and cosmetics. At night, the streets are filled with street hawkers selling different types of Korean snacks including strawberry mochi, deep fried chicken, bbq beef, grill scallops, etc. Must taste the strawberries in Korea which is very sweet and fresh. You can also find all types of restaurants here from high end bbq beef and pork, ginseng chicken soup, seafood hotpot to local Korean dumplings and noodles. This place can satisfy both your dining and shopping needs. A must for all who visit Seoul."
Alive,"This is a must-go, especially at night. The street becomes alive, full of people, shops, restaurants, street food, lights. Good way to spend an evening in Seoul. "
A shopping heaven for ladies/makan street,"A cross junction street lined up with numerous facial shops, plenty of choices for the vainpot or gifts for friends. There's a cat cafe or dog cafe if you are roaming during the day. A quiet tea time with the furry friends. Come nightime, rows of food stalls start appearing and plenty of food to choose from. The grilled corn cob, the traditional burnt toffee to the pure pomegranate/grapefruit juice, chestnut, fish pancakes and so much more! The choice is endless! Cute socks at 1000₩!I'm totally attracted to this street not just for shopping but to soak in the food fiesta and buzz. You have to visit Myeongdong! Oh ya Daiso is located here as well. :)"
Love the Street Food (Many variaties),Love the Street Food. Although not that cheap but most of them are Yummy. Especially love the unique pork belly roll with kimichi..vegetables and wrapped with cabbage and grilled to perfection with sauce. My children love the grilled scculent fleshy scallop with cheese and sweet corn.
Make up shopping and food trip galore!,One stop place for make-up/skin care shopping/hoarding and Korean souvenir shopping. Make up store are right next to each other... Even having the same store on every block! Just come inside and buy one item and you get a lot of freebies! During the weekends... A lot of food vendors Aside from the restaurants found in the street of Myeongdong!
"Good Shopping location, easy communicate",Myeongdong known for Shopping heaven for women. You can get lots of korean trendy cosmetics and fashion in that area. Easy communicate with the staff in store. Lots of restaurant and cafe. suitable for both friends & family. 
Must-visit,"A bustling street that has plenty of shopping, especially for skincare products. A personal must-visit place for me as I love the street food there. Go around after 5pm and the vendors will be out preparing. There's snacks like escargot on a stick, cuttlefish, fried bananas, fried chicken and lots more. Myeongdong can be quite huge for first timers and easy to get lost as there's many side lanes, so it's advisable not to split up for first time visitors. There are restaurants deeper inside myeongdong and usually on the upper floors. "
Myeongdong Best Night Market ever!!,"Myeongdong - Shopping paradise. Best Night Market, you'll be spoil for choices.Especially for the ladies - Make-up, skincare products, shoes, clothes, bags..to name a few. Rows of vendor with their kiosk selling all sorts of goodies. There's also a Halal kiosk selling Dragon-beard Candies & Kebabs. We simply love it!!"
"Shop, eat, repeat.","As the title implies, Myeongdong is known for shopping and eating. You'll find the same cosmetics stores on every corner, multiple times. There is a second floor cafe called Poem that has good tea and patbingsu. Telling you that it's on the street with a cosmetic store on the corner is totally unhelpful. If you can find Poem, go in for the tea or coffee (which comes with a slice of cake with each drink) and patbingsu."
Tourists Heaven,"Myeongdong is always busy with tourists and this destination is always included in the itinerary of tour groups. Personally, I would avoid this place as I prefer shopping and dining elsewhere as everything here is expensive. However, you must visit this place at least once just to experience the atmosphere.I brought my sister and brother-in-law to this place as this was their 1st trip to Seoul. Unfortunately, they did not like this place as it was very crowded and they are not big fans of shopping. Nevertheless, we soaked in the atmosphere and left after seeing some beautiful Christmas lightings."
Atmospheric area,"The area is always busy, but it's best in the evening. Sounds and smells from everywhere in this east meets west fusion of designer goods and street food."
Full on Korean experience ,"Shopping. Street food. Life sized teddy bear men. What else do you need?This area is pretty much what people all over the world want to see when they come visit Seoul. Crazy lights, cheap socks, food carts and cafes line the crowded streets. Its touristy but definitely worth experiencing at least once. "
Shopper Heaven,"One Day is definitely not enough, from cosmetics, street food and many more! there's Dongdaemun and Namdaemun market around, if you're about to go to seoul, this is a place you should, find a hotel nearby! and you can shop here whenever you want"
Massive shopping in Seoul!,"All kind of shopping, dining, money changers packed in one place. All big chains are present in the area.Don't miss it if you are in Seoul."
Bit of a tourist trap,"So, I visited Myeongdong a few times while I was in Korea and all I can say is, it's not for me. I'm not a big fan of shopping in general but I was hoping to find something unique in Myeongdong in terms of atmosphere and street food. Didn't really find it. It's like a big maze with the same brands constantly reappearing and it's the only place I got lost in while I was in Seoul. The saleswomen are quite pushy and follow you around in the shops, stating prices for the things you're looking at which is probably a cultural thing but didn't really work for me at all. I like to do my shopping in peace. It's also one of the most crowded places in Seoul. I would rather recommend Insadong and the traditional markets."
Shop till you drop,"Typical place to go, I was always shopping there. Full of tourists, especially from China buying their favorite facial products. Gotta love being screamed at in 4 different languages to come in and buy cosmetics lol. Go try out the street foods, go to a nice little cafe, and then buy some face masks. All the big brands are there too."
Busy and happening,"Interesting shops, people everywhere. A must-visit if you're keen to try out local food, buy some souvenirs."
Endless alleys of shops,"Wow, there is always a store with every turn I took. There is no shortage of shops up on the main street or even underneath by the subway or crossing of streets. Tons of stalls. There is no high end. Catered more to medium. Some good brand. Maybe a few stalls of souvenirs but mostly mainstream shopping.Tons of people, tons of street vendors and careful with cars driving to maneuver their way. It is mostly pedestrian though "
A happening night market,"I like to go there if I go to Korea. It is a happening market, you will get to try local food at reasonable price. You will get to see all kinds of people and shop many many shops. Anyway, the things there quite expensive compare to Namdaemon and others. "
Busy but nice place to see,Very busy area especially at night. Day and night are very different vibes. If you want shopping just go during the day but if you want a variety of street food and a lively scene go at night.
All in one area,"If you like to shop, myeongdong is the heaven for you especially cosmetic lovers. There are cosmetic outlets everywhere. You can find Uniqlo and any any other brands here. If you like to eat and buy street food, just walk around and prepare your stomach. We find the best rate money exchange near Chinese restaurant."
Shopping Heaven for (Female) Tourist,"If you're a woman who love make up, sure this is a place where you should go during your travel in Seoul. They sell every Korean make up you know. Mention it, they have it in there. I love to hang out in Hollys Coffee in Myeongdeong. Great place for do some work."
Shopping Galore,Cosmetics haven. Some of the products here are way cheaper than those sold in other branches. Be sure to watch the NANTA Show at Myeongdong theatre as well!
Hip place with lots of shops,"If you like shopping, this is a good place to visit. Many shops, restaurants, especially cosmetics shops are round every corner. We visited on a weekday and went back on the weekend. It was so happening on the Saturday we went, many food vendors and activities ongoing. Great atmosphere. "
Hype,"Besides buying snacks to eat as we strolled the streets at this shopping place, we did not buy anything after 2 hours of walking and looking around for fun and killing time before we headed to the airport. Packs with tourists. Our Korean tour guide said that only tourists shop here, but the locals buy their stuff else where as it cheaper."
Best place for shopping with so much to buy!,"Myeongdong Hyper Shopping is by far the best place I have ever been to for shopping. There is such a selection of things to choose from ranging from restaurants, cafes,street food, skincare, clothing stores, spa's and the prices range from extremely low to high so it it great for someone on a budget or other people who like shopping and won't mind spending so much. I would recommend this as a place for anyone who loves shopping."
Love it,"If you like shopping specialy for woman,myeongdong is heaven for us because there is so many cosmetic store that you can buy.they give you sample if you came to their store.i really like been here staff of the store very kindly and if you buy they will give you so many gift "
Good shopping.,"One of the more popular markets for visits. Many shops selling beauty products (with free gifts), food outlets - traditional, Korean or fast food, cafe and places for different types of coffee, a variety of other shops interspersed with many shopping centers(small ones). Requires a day or two to complete walking its many streets and intersections. Wear comfortable shoes. Try the street side food as well. You can get some good bargains. A most visit."
A place to buy everything,"Clothes, makeup, facial products, food, name brands, big department stores, restaurants..you name it, this place got it! I literally spent every day here. "
Fun in Myeongdong ,We stayed very near to Myeongdong. We will shop every night.Not all stalls sell items that are cheap so do look around first before you want to get. Some stalls sells reasonable earrings / socks 1000 won for 1 pair -$1.2410000won for 1 bag-$12 plus The bags are very pretty.I bought 2 for myself and 5 for my loved ones. Go to this restaurant called Sinseon Seolnongtang beside Bee Cheng Hiang at Myeongdong.The beef soup and kimchi is good. You can buy the kimchi back for your Loved ones. Enjoy yourselves when you are there especially the weather over there is cold now. 
Great Shopping Experience,"You can find anything in this alley. Branded goods, local style... If you're sneaker-heads you can find many brands. If you're bags fans, you should find many interesting local bags. "
"Shop for cosmetics and clothes, try the delicious street food!","This area has a good variety of cosmetic shops, food stalls on the street (weekends), lots of cute stuff like mobile phone covers, socks, keyring and all that cute stuff you expect to find in Asia. They also have dog and cat cafes (if you love pets, GO!), restaurants, nice cafes (including Hello Kitty cafe) and delicious street food. Don't miss the hotteok (sweet pancake filled with nuts and brown sugar) and gyeranbbang (muffin kind of bread topped with egg), sold on the street food stalls. It's a must visit place in Seoul."
Very nice to shopping there.,So happy to shopping there.. So many brands shops are there & give us Tax Refund. It's so good to us. 
The best shopping street in Seoul,"You can find everything here. From cart seller street food to the biggest department stores. This is the best shopping district. Full of shops, cafes and restaurants too. You can even do the tax refund in this area. "
Great - specially in the evening,"Went there during the day and evening, You can shop for clothing and cosmetics. There is a huge Uniqlo shop next to metro station.In the evening it is more extreme. many food places open, tons of peoples and the lights are amazing, Dont miss"
Shop Till You Drop,"Everywhere its shops, cafe, restaurants. Super-busy place during weekend so be aware. Many cosmetics and fashions shops here. If you like crowd this is a great place to be. Many street foods to satisfy your taste buds."
the hotest place to shopping for tourist,"many kinds of foods street and souvenirs and distro for any product of cosmetics, fashion, theatre and cullinary of traditional korean dishes. near from myeongdong subway station. we can walk with fun to enjoy the ambience. dont go to this place on winter seasson. rain and cold is not good for your condition. in the midle of alley, we can see Unesco building with good show act. get more time on here..enjoy"
Woman (girl) shopping paradise,"A busy place where selling lots of Korean brand cosmetics, (most likely are repeated outlets) They offer free gifts when purchasing item from the store, likes the street food (meat balls, ice cream etc) and there are lots of eateries shop too. There is a place in Myeongdong beside the hotel which allows us to have free photo shooting in hanbok that offer to the foreigners (but must booked for a time slot)"
SHOPPING!,"Where else to go! Even, if you never planed to go there... I didn't, it was a surprise for me, to find out, after 4 hours, what time I'd already spent! My credit card still isn't burning, so that means, it is worth it!"
Fantastic," Visited Myeongdong in the evening when it comes alive didn't go to buy anything just to see all the lights, music, food stalls etc and mix with the local people.It really is worth visiting with everywhere decorated for Christmas.Every other shop has different music playing which creates a great atmosphere"
Great place for strolling around and shopping,"Lots of shops and various stores and cafes, including various reataurants - all near the Myeondong Catholic Cathedral. Shopping experience was great and prices not too bad. I was there on a Friday and Sunday and it was much more crowded on Sunday."
It comes alive during the night,You can shop the whole night here and still cannot cover all the shops. It get so pack during the night and so many street food.
Nice place to roam around in Seoul,Liked roaming around in this area with good shopping and eateries option. It was the only area which was open late night for shopping and a lot of tourists.
Just what you expect,"As other reviewers have said, it is touristy in many respects with the same merchandise, perhps higher prices in restaurants etc. Knowing that fact, I would probably not eat there but it still was a fun experience to wander around if you have the time and I loved watching my Grandaughter bargain with them knowing very little Korean but just enough to know when they were trying to take advantage. Also as others have noted Namdaemum is perhaps a better option if you only have time for one area."
Shopper's Paradise,"If you are a shopaholic, Myeongdong is surely a place to visit and shop. All kinds of trendy stuffs in this area and could see the 'hip' things. "
Place for shopping but shops selling almost all the same things.....,"This is a very crowded place but what would you expect of a place where shops especially skin care are all here?Very excited as I love shopping and I know I can grab a lot of skincare products cheap. And I was right. Not only I'm pampered with lots of options especially skin care, I'm pampered with the skin care samples they give out freely. You get lots more samples if you buy anything from them. This is excellent concept as I can go back and try before deciding if I will buy. However after about 2 hours there, I got rather bored as the shops lack variety. Many shops of the same brand are within walking distance. The size of the shops are similar meaning you won't find things exclusive to like perhaps bigger stores. Nice place to shop but you do not need a lot of time there. "
Too touristy,I found Myeongdong too touristy. I asked some local people and they said that they would avoid going to Myeongdong as the restaurants there are quite pricey. Shops are meant for selling stuff to tourists. Street foods there are at least 1/3 more expensive and less tasty than those find in other areas such as Namdaemum. 
Busy Busy Busy,This was our first excursion out after arriving in Seoul. Very busy streets full of shoppers. Looks like all the big name shops. Street food was abundant. It was well worth the metro ride and if you were a shopper it would be heaven! We stopped after walking around and had Beer and potatoes. Hope to go back in the daylight and see it again.
"Too big, the same goods all around",I was looking for some items and was told to look for them in this location/market. was looking for it for hours. not again!
Absolutely heaven,"You must must come here. ..The shops are filled with skincare goodness and it's hard to resist. Do not worry about the tax refund process, they've simplified it a lot and you only queue once at tax refund and after checking in, once to get your cash. So go ahead, shop til you drop. The egg bread here is 2000 won, other places like Ewha is only 1000won. So get your egg bread fix at Ewha instead."
Family vacation,Good place to shop and have plenty of street stores. Many good restaurants too. Very crowded but alright to go. The stuff selling there slightly better quality and designs and of course you pay a little bit more. The is a MCM boutique there in case you are looking for one. 
Great place for shopaholic,The streets are always full of people both local and tourists. There are plenty of things that you would like to buy especially cosmetics and local food. I visited Myeongdong every night when I stayed in Seoul. This is a must-go place in Seoul.
Shopping shopping shopping,"If you don't like shopping, don't come. I had one goal in coming here and that was to stock up on Korean skincare products. They have them in abundance here. And if you can't find the item you want at one store, chances are there's the exact same store around the corner. This was actually a little confusing because I kept getting turned around. But there are people in all red walking around with an ""i"" on their hat that you can ask if you need help finding somewhere. Speaking of skincare shops though, they all have people standing outside waving free face masks in your face to entice you to come in. I even encountered someone who grabbed me, yes, literally grabbed me and tried to drag me inside. I had to forcefully shake her off, and needless to say, I didn't visit that store. If you go inside, someone will literally follow you around trying to help you (make you buy something). They speak English at most stores, but they seem more comfortable speaking Mandarin. If you buy stuff they usually give you some free samples of other products to try. One other thing to note is that it's very busy no matter when you go. And even though there is so much pedestrian traffic, there are still cars that force their way through the crowds, and even worse than them are the motorcycles. They aren't concerned with you and will drive extremely close to you and would probably hit you if you didn't move. I found this really irritating.The buildings look really cool and each one is unique. There are lots of places to eat and snack. Most of the shops are geared toward females though."
Girly heaven!!! Men's nightmare!!!,"Anyone who's been to Myeongdong knows...if you want to torture your male better half...bring them there!!! It's just a girly heaven with numerous skincare, cosmetics and cheap fashion shops...definitely not the best dating place in Seoul."
fun,"We went there lastweek it was fun. They sell many interesting street food,cheap bag and etc. right in the center of the road. Go there at night time they sell more stuff and it looks pretty bec of the lights! "
Great food great Shopping,Buy all the face mask you need here. Typically there are better discount on friday evening also. Food are good also love the BBQ here.
Awesome,"Many attractive food sell here at night and many awesome korean restaurant here, also many beauty shop ang cloth sell here. The weather here quite cold on december we must bring therma jacket, hat , glove"
TOO MUCH FACE MASKS!,The whole strip of Myeondong offers a wide array of beauty shops which offer face masks...a lot of them. Nice place to experience the busy shopping spree while munching on slightly overpriced street food.
Shop 'til you drop,"I went with three adult female friends in search of ""Forever 21."" We were treated instead to a variety of yummy Korean street food typical to Winter. My personal favorites were gyeranbbang (egg bread/cake) and hotteok (pancakes). And to various street vendors for scarves, gloves, beanies/hats to deal with the freezing temperature. In addition to the multiple clothing stores, cafes, and beauty product stores, there is an underground flea market style shopping center accessible by an exit from the subway."
Fantastic street,this is where you get all the street food and street shopping at its best... Lots of restaurants and dessert places. There are many streets there and usually very crowded! One place it is a must try... Korean Dessert Shop. Shaved ice dessert... very very good.
Cosmetic shopping district in Seoul :),"Lots of korean cosmetic products you can think of! Good prices and they are giving loads of a freebies..as a man, I was a bit shy entering the stores to buy stuff for my sister and mother :)Cons: busy streets most of the time, take care of your belongings."
Great place to shop,"Even though this place is considered a tourist trap, I would still come back here each and every time I visit Seoul just for the fact that everything is located in this one area. I love the wide array of cosmetic stores spread out for you to choose from. The various restaurants and food carts here are also quite delicious. If you want to experience the hustle and bustle of Seoul, then for sure make a stop here."
Amazing local desert shop,"We really enjoy this honeydew ice cream, it make of a whole really honeydew fruit. Layer: honeydew + sweet milk + ice cream + red bean. It's seasonal desert, even it's cold and rain outside, we still love it so much. It is so popular that I couldn't have it as it's sold out when I travel Korea in Early Aug last time. It can serve up to 3 pax. Mummy~"
I love this place!!,"So much stuff going on this area, lots of good deals in the latest make-up and skin care products as well as cheap and delicious food stalls. Local to well known brands are located on the same spot so its not hard to find."
Shopping Steet,"Streets full of cosmetic shops, clothings, shoes, restaurants, adding road side shops stores from evening. There is something you will like while walking along the streets. This is packed with people every evenings, I found less people in local comestic shops as you can get a better deal, if you buy a lot, from Lotte Duty Free which is just nearby. The roadside stores like night markets in Taipei. Perfect to spend few hours walking around, especially from 6-10pm every nights"
Great shopping place especially for Korean Beauty Products,"Great shopping place especially for Korean Beauty Products. Every corner they have shops like Etude, The Face Shop, It's Skin and etc. When buying from these stores, do not forget to ask for freebies. Also ask for a tax refund receipt. You can get a tax refund for a minimum purchase of 30,000 Won. I had a great time here. Taking the subway, use Exit 6 of Myeong-dong Station (Line 4). From here, it's a walking distance also to Namdaemun Marktet."
I love Myeongdong!!,"We went there 3 times for shopping and eating..The shops there were so exciting and interesting,one could easily spend a whole day there.Cafes everywhere for you to rest your feet from the endless shopping.Myeongdong is a MUST GO for anyone who visit Korea!!"
Korea's Shoppers' Paradise,"If you think of Myeongdong, you think of a shopper's paradise where almost everything is in there. Our friend took us there for her to buy some cosmetics. It ended that we bought for us too. We're very lucky because it was a Black Friday sale for some of the famous brands like Skin Food and Nature Republic! Good to note that every store that we went to has an English speaking person. The place is very busy and the streets are lined with kiosks offering different street foods so you will never go hungry. There are restos around if you need to dine and sit. You need to wear comfy shoes because you'll do a lot of walking and ensure that you have enough Korean Won to use to purchase because most of the stores accept Won. It's worth coming back."
"very touristy place, so long your are chinese, you will be taken as PRC","Too touristy and many PRC salesgirls are selling the Korea skin care and some Korean made product. the night market that set up at 530pm nightly are much more expensive, what you see there , you can get them easily at Underground shopping center which are plenty ."
Great shopping place!!!,Hundreds of brands to choose with great price. They also give a lot of freebies and samples. It is also easy to pay cause they accept both credit card and debit card as long as it has visa logo. there are also a lot of restaurant and variety of street food vendors.
Wonderful shopping district,"It was amazing, spend hours on shopping whole day , buy and buy latest trend of clothes. Busy district, there were many stores "
sooo busy...,wasnt for me..but definitely busy and worth the look..but i didnt want to stay because of the masses of ppl...
shopping area,"if you like go to shop,then you must visit this place. many small boutique that offer a cosmetic product, fashion and also food market. no cars allowed in this place."
Shop 'til you drop!,PROS: Shops were everywhere. Restaurants and Money changers were present too. Street foods were delicious. Huge place. Get ready your feet for a long walk.CONS: Too many beauty shops. Geeez!LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 3/5
Awesome atmosphere,"Loved the vibe. Christmas deco everywhere. No cars allowed. Hundreds of shops, street foods, Nanta theater..."
Awesome Shopping!,"I was in Seoul for only five days, but I visited Myeongdong thrice! A really great place to shop as there are alleys to explore and cute little shops to browse through. There are a few cafes to sit in to rest your feet after some crazy shopping. If you prefer cafes that are familiar, there is Starbucks and Coffee Bean!"
Busy shopping area with small boutiques,Myeongdong area has a lot of small boutiques especially for skin products and clothing. There are also small eating places. Uniquo is also anchored there. It is a very busy area any time of the day. It is more for younger age. 
Best Shopping Area,"You can spend days at Myeongdong shopping for clothes, skincare, shoes, etc. There are plenty of good restaurants. You can just sit at the coffee shop and people watch. "
A nice place for shopping,I'm not quite keen on shopping but it's quite worth to spend some time on visiting this place. Large varieties of cosmetic shops. There're three towers of large shopping mall. I know many people visiting there to buy Korea cosmetics but my wife was surprised to find that the multi-national brands of cosmetics (like Extee Laudxx) sold in Duty Free shops are even cheaper than Hong Kong.
You can get anything here,"Cosmetics, street food, clothes, souvenirs! You can find all here but it's so crowded espesially on weekend."
Shopping area thats fun!,"Buy all the cosmetics here, its crowded but fun. Most sales ladies can speak english and are very helpful compared to the people at the malls."
Must go for facial and cosmetic product ,A shopping heaven for facial and cosmetic products. The same brand can have multiple stores within Myeongdong and tourists do enjoy hefty discounts. 
Huge place to shop and eat,We have bought many things here and we have tried different kinds of street foods during the evening. Yummy. 
"Metropolitan shopping center, like everywhere else","Crowded business district and a lot of fashion/food/cosmetic stores to visit. if you are into Korean pop culture, good place to go"
all skin care u can buy here,"except duty free, this is the best area to buy skin care & cosmetic. remember to ask for more sample / gift during the shopping, they always giveaway the different gifts from different shops even same brand "
Cheap cosmetic!,Lots and lots of cheap cosmetic to be grabbed at Myeongdong street!! Girls will never want to miss this place!!
Not for me,"The shopping malls are the same wherever you go - same brands, same exhorbitant prices. Very little local or unique stuff. Full of Chinese tourists with an enormous appetite to devour everything esp cosmetics"
Black Friday - the next level,"Went shopping here on Black Friday, and it was amazing. Shops are crammed into every space in this neighbourhood, and the shopping is great. Check it out! Stay around into the evening for tasty street food."
Good place for cosmetics and street food. ,"This is famous for shopping. But actually it was origin of Private Finance. And cultural area. After that we have many cosmetic shops. Restaurants are naturally became popular here. We have all different types of restaurants. Good place for shopping, eating, show, movie. :) "
Girls Wonderland,"Great shopping, street food, clothing stores and local stores. Make sure to visit around other cosmetic stores of the same brand because not all of them are doing the same deals. one store we went to we purchused 10 face masks. visit the same one a few walks down and they were doing 10 + 10 face masks same price. Try the street foods and a few restaurants speak english. I do not recommend Outback Steak House there...really bad service."
Crazy shopping here - come hungry!,"Awesome shopping street with well known and unknown brands alike. Come hungry as there will be a multitude of street hawkers selling all sorts of food. Dessert, steak, octopus, chocolate covered bananas, name it. I particularly liked the vibrancy of the place as there are also lots of street sellers displaying anything from socks to beanies, to all colors of scarves and mufflers. Very colorful place and alive with activity."
Cosmetics cosmetics!,Find all the cosmetic items you need here! Prices are cheap too. Face masks are sold in bundles. Hand cream as well.
"crowded, interesting place","couple of quarters of shops and street markets with food, cosmetics, clothes etc. Really great initial cosmetics -based on snail solutions it is marvelous for skin care, and cheap. Based in the city center, just 15 minutes walk from Seoul station."
Shopping Paradise,"A shopping paradise especially for the young. It's a one stop hub where you can get your skin care, cosmetic, apparel, etc. If you want to snack on the street food/get cheaper clothing/bags, go after 5pm. Quality is very good despite buying from a ""pasar malam""."
"Great area of Seoul to spend time shopping, eating and sightseeing","The Myeongdong District is a busy shopping and dining district in Seoul. Here you will find large department stores, street lined shops and vendors as well as an endless array of street foods, cafes, coffee shops, bars and restaurants serving up Korean and international cuisines. We very much enjoyed the Myeongdong area during our recent visit to Seoul, finding ourselves here several times during our stay. It is a particularly enjoyable location after dark when the building signs are lit up. Main streets are lined with street food vendors and smaller alleys have many eateries to choose from. We particularly liked the Yoogane restaurant in Myeongdong. This place serves up galbi dishes, which are grilled directly at your table. Coffee shops are a plenty in the area and there quirky places to experience as well, such as the area Cat Cafe and the similar Dog Cafe.More conventional sightseeing in the area includes the Meyongdong Cathedral and Myeongdong Nanta Theatre. Shoppers will delight in the wide variety of retail shops in the area as well as the huge Lotte Department Store, the flagship of this Korean franchise. Overall, We find the Myeongdong district a great location to spend time during visits to Seoul. There is much to see, shop for and taste in this area of the city. It is well worth allocating at least one evening here during trips to Seoul."
So colorful ,"This place is like a cosmetic heaven for ladies because there is a lots of cosmetic shops in this area...If you are foreigners and need help, no worries there is tourist info centre and info-guys (wearing red bright jacket n hat)"
A very crowded but worth it to shop.,"A nice place to shop. Almost have everything from clothing, to bags, cosmetics. There are also lots so delicious street foods we tried."
Shopping mecca,"We love myeongdong as they have the widest range of korean cosmetics brands available here so you can compare prices, freebies before deciding which ones to go for. They provide the tax refund forms which can be easily processed at the airport and you can collect your cash before flying off.The area is filled with cafes, restaurants, street food and there is plenty to choose should one gets peckish while shopping. The boutiques sell the latest fashion, accessories, shoes. There is also Lotte Mall if one prefers more upmarket brands and the basement supermarket is where one goes crazy shopping for Korean food products to bring home."
Shopping spree!,I really love this place. Hyper shopping indeed. Shopping heaven for girls of course! Busy road and happening. Just took a train to Myeongdong station. I went here like few times when im in Seoul. I bought a tons of skincare and cosmetics product. There were kinda cheap here i must say. We walked through the street feasting our eyes on the street food around. Dont forget to buy a unique snack and munch while u're shopping.
Shopping mecca,"This place is awesome for people who love to shop, especially for those who love local Korean brands. They have a lot of quirky stores, but they also have a lot of big chain clothing brands as well. Plus the street food along the alley ways are cheap and interesting. "
Good place for shopping,"Good place for shopping but the stuff there is pricey. Street food is delicious. Very crowded when we went on weekend. Must visit the Myeongdong Catholic Church nearby. Visit Namsan N Tower too, great scenery."
Bargain for Cosmetic,"We went there on the first night we were in Seoul since it is close to our hotel. It is alive with street vendors selling all kinds if items including food. We found one stall selling halal croissant, but at about RM12 a piece, it is very expensive! There are many competing cosmetic shops offering products at discounted prices. So it is a good place for ladies. The shops are open until late at night."
Full of life,"Great place to shop and window shop. Easy connectivity with metro. Many big malls, small outlets, restaurants and fast food joints are available. Good place exchange your foreign currency too. Enjoy the atmosphere, which is very lively."
Heaven for shopping,Love Myeongdong. it has literally have eveything. From the best cosmetic store to the best restaurant. it is all situated in Myeong Dong.Worth visiting.
Heaven for girls who looking for Cosmetic,"provided many shops which sell cosmetic. In the night time, food stalls begin to open which offer many local taste which reasonable price. For a women who is looking for cosmetic, this is one of the place. "
It's totally crazy - Hypershopping at Myeongdong,"Stores, Restaurants, Bars, Pet Shops, Clothing, Coffee Shops and whatever any other venue you may imagine in this place, including and an average of 3 Seven Eleven stores per 100sq. mt radius!!! Totally crowded every night, snowing or raining. Totally recommended for shoppers and night owls!"
A place to soak in the atmosphere,"This is my 2nd trip to. Seoul and I am not a cosmetic /skin care shopper... But I enjoyed the night atmosphere at this place. It's so full of vibes ! Street food stalls, apparel stalls / shops and the numerous restaurants and cafes .... But you have to pray hard that it won't rain when you are there as it's difficult to move about when it rain heavily."
Shopping Haven - 1 stop shop,"Your one stop shopping haven from Skin care, Make-up, clothing, shoes, street foods, fast food, restaurants, buffets, department stores to duty free! We really enjoyed walking around, shopping and eating here. It could get overwhelming but take your time and check the stores out, no harm in looking. You will enjoy this place, we all did.Tip: come earlier (around 10-1030am) on a weekend or go on a weekday so you're not overwhelmed with the amount of people and vendors on the streets. This is a VERY busy area."
shopping best,great shopping place. i go to korean dessert cafe and try their sulbing. very delicious and recommended. should go next time! 
"If you don't like crowds, avoid here","It is extremely crowded. We came here at night to buy cosmetics as South Korea is famous for their skin care products. There are so many cosmetic companies here, you don't know where to start. I would suggest doing some online research before coming here. The stores here entice you with buy more, save more tactics. And they load you up with free samples with each purchase. Socks are cheaper here than Insadong by a few won. But the alleys around Dongdaemun are the cheapest.I am not sure if this area is the cheapest for cosmetics though. I find the prices quite comparable to other places."
Myeongdong not a place to miss.,"It is paradise for young people, cosmetics and street food. Seems to be crowded all day. So many Korean brands and cheap or rather a bargain. Easily accessible by subway. Actually the subway or below ground shopping are connected. You can actually walk and reach there from the Main station without getting onto the road. "
For vanity and quirkiness sake,"For all those who can't stand a day without looking in the mirror, and getting all the latest in fashion, I'd say this is the place to be. In our 6 days in Seoul, we always go here in the evening for that window shopping and nice stroll. Filled with food carts selling Korean delicacies, as well as all sorts of cosmetic and beauty shops in every corner offering absurd sales and discounts, this is a haven for the shopaholic. To add, you can also find here themed cafes of which I really looked forward to such as the wonder dogs cafe and hello kitty cafe. Accessible by train or even walking, I find this a nice place, comparable to evening shopping districts in Singapore and Malaysia, the only downside is that I really find Korean products super expensive, so prepare a thick wallet. "
Beauty Products Shoppers Paradise,"A ""must do"" when visiting Seoul. You need a whole day maybe even more to shop around and compare prices. A good place to buy anything a woman needs to remain and keep oneself beautiful. And you don't need a small fortune to buy the things you need. "
Shopping Haven,"Myeongdong is a shopping haven especially for women. Make up brands are all over the place with all the discounts. Huge Forever 21. Bags, clothes, accessories, souvenir items and etc. if you get hungry, there are a lot of food carts or cafés everywhere. There's also Hello Kitty along Myeongdong. Truly indeed shopping haven.I definitely recommend you to visit. "
Fantastic place for cosmetics,"I believe it is a best place to do cosmetics shopping in Seoul. There are lot of stores and you have lot of options and choices to choose from. The creams, face mask, snail mask etc. are excellent. The shops will also give you freebies depending upon your bill."
Skincare Products & Cosmetic Galore!,"Lotsssss of skincare & cosmetics boutiques here. And the prices are very cheap! You can get lots of sample from every purchase and sometimes, samples are given even by just entering the store. Various street foods, restaurant and cafe can be found here and Myeongdong is very alive at night."
Shopping,"It's all about shopping when it come to Myeongdong. Everyone will love to shop facial care, clothes and everything."
Shopping and eating,"Lots of shops, cafes and restaurants. There is a hanbok photo studio. Tons of money exchange booths. Uniqlo has the biggest store here and it's a popular meeting place. Felt like this area catered more to women as heaps of cosmetics and clothing stores had feminine decor. There are quite a few hotels in the area: hotel skypark, prince, savoy, Mizo, ekonomy, the stay hotel etc. I suppose this location would be super convenient, especially when one can even purchase additional luggage here. My major concern was the traffic in the area. The roads are not blocked off for pedestrians on weekdays. I saw cars flying by when people were shopping on the streets. Keep your eyes open when walking around. "
You cannot visit Seoul without visiting Myeongdong!,"This place is a shoppers paradise! What makes it so great is that it is so distinctively Korean. Rows and rows of Korean makeup brands, Korean restaurants and Korean street vendors! You get almost ANYTHING here, from food to clothes to jewellery to souvenirs. My main highlights of Myeongdong were the ridiculously cheap make-up, delicious street food, a cute cat café (look out for the yellow cat near H&M) and the NANTA performance."
Myeondong November 2015,"Definitely Hyper! Esp on Saturday night. Mostly make up stores though - street food here is great! Steak, chicken bbq, squid, crepes, fresh juices, baby crispy crabs etc etc! This is where our hotel is located, great location for tourists intending to do some major shopping! :-)"
Fun shopping and snacks,"Where can you get a Hello kitty on your latte, Ray a rose shaped gelato, see a top rated show, hear KPOP music, see smurfs walking around, shop, get street character socks for less than a dollar, try a Sulbing shave ice, and eat great street food 9 am to midnight? In Myeongdong! This is such an exciting part of Seoul to explore. Take the subway to Myeongdong station. You can't drive on the alleys on Myeongdong , you just get out and explore on foot about to+ square blocks. It's always crowded, so if you are expecting that, it's ok. "
Eat eat eat shop shop shop!,"Being in Seoul for the first time and living in Singapore all my life, I wasn't that keen to spend a day shopping in urban city, but! I changed my mind after landing my feet in Myeongdong at ard 3pm and couldn't get enough of it and left by 10pm! Colorful, lively, bustling and packed, interesting night market and the cool weather made it perfect to explore, stop, take photos, eat, drink & shop. "
A Must Shopping Stop,"There's such a variety of items here, you could find almost anything here. But I was most impress with the food vendors who sells very delicious Korean street food. I like the fish meat on skewers, the rice rolls in kimchi sauce and the potato ring on a stick the best. They also have fresh squeezed juice ranging from sugar cane to pomegranate which tasted extra delicious after the spicy rice rolls in kimchi sauce. Access to this area is easily reached by subway so transportation is no sweat. A must visit for shopping and food tasting..."
Wow! so much shopping,"Shopaholics paradise this place. You can get good street food too. In October, all the shops were selling winter clothes, which I didn't need. Can get loads of novelties too, like socks, phone cases, toys"
"Vibrant atmosphere, full of energy","I think all tourist will visit Myeongdong at least once during their visit to Seoul, I was there at least 4 times either browsing around the shops or having a meal in the vicinity.The place is full of young people, there would be cosmetic shops everywhere, the same brand would have at least 5 outlets or more, it's amazing...this is the place to buy cosmetics.There are also international Brands like H&M, Uniqlo, New Balance besides local brand that sells clothing, shoes, bags, souvenirs etc giving a wide choice for shoppers.In the middle of the pedestrian only road, you would find stalls selling local food including fried cuttle fish, crabs, potato chips, fruits( persimmon and strawberries in season) plus many others.Myeongdong also house a number of restaurants, cafes both local and international bands, Starbucks and Hollys coffee would have at least 5 outlets each. Towards the end of the shop lots you would find a number of seafood and Korean restaurants serving the working local crowd.There are also a number of hotels as well.It's a place you can almost find all you need, I would recommend this place."
Looks like the dump pile at goodwill,"I was looking forward to the markets, but this place was a horror! Piles of used clothing that looked like reject pile from goodwill. Just a lot of crap. They have really poor quality ""designer"" bags, and stuff, but priced as though they thought they were real. Wait, you're calling that really bad thing with the Cs, Gucci? I looked at the very poor quality fur hats snd vests, the prices started at 900$ no buddy, 50$ would be a stretch. only thing decent was the street food. "
Great shopping experience,"Stayed in Seoul for 2 nights, went to Myeongdong both nights. Every night i bought something. Clothes, shoes, socks, cosmetics, knick-knacks, food more food. Everything so inexpensive. A must go in Seoul n"
Fabulous district ,"The best district ever many shops ,restaurants and cafes. it's crowded all the time..try to visit it in night time .. it will be more fun it's one of the best places in Seoul "
Overrated,"I, personally, feel that this place is a bit overrated. It's a large shopping area where you can find any cosmetic brands. Some brands even have more than 3 outlets around the whole area. You can also find other international clothing brands, such as: uniqlo, h&m, zara, nike, etc. And there are some street vendors that sell korean street snacks & other goods which was interesting (more interesting to me than the regular shops on the side). Don't forget to visit the Korean Culture Center at M Plaza if you're in this area so you can do some activities for free or a small fee, including photos with hanbok (free). "
Loads of shops from big-brands to local,"I had a great day shopping here. Lots of the shops had sales, and I was able to buy my international favourites at a fraction of the cost. The main walking streets are wide, and I didn't feel jostled or claustrophobic at all (although I was not there in peak season perhaps?). Worth a visit, even if just for window shopping at the variety of items on offer."
Craziest Shopping Area in Seouk,This area is the craziest shopping area in Seoul...Fantastic wide range of Street food...amazing crowds...lively shops.. Best for women shopping for cosmetics you are spoilt for choice...Dont forget to collect samples when u checkout
Shopping street,"U can find everything here in Myeongdong street. Recommend place to stop by for shopping for everything especially clothes, cosmetics and souvenior. "
Myeong dong for those facial masks & skincare!,"Awesome shopping paradise for girls and momsies and be totally spoilt for choice of facial masks, specifically those must-have Snail masks and other skincare products. Shops like Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Laneige, you name it. Clothes and fashion wear too but they were mostly of winter wear at the moment."
King of king of malls,This place is like Vegas but its not casinos on every corner but malls and stores. I got alot of my souvenir here. Save your receipt too. If you are foreigner you can get your money back on taxes from some places. Look for the global sign. I found out about this too late from my roomate. I didnt buy clothes here. I'm a plus size girl but I did find a Japanese store where I could buy bras here. Im an H cup in that store lol who knew. In american I'm a DD. If you are looking for bras to fit you ladies you can find them here. 
You just have to shop！,This place is amazing! Even if you don't have anything to buy you will buy something. The cosmetics here were too hard to resist. Come on the right days and you will find yourself in the midst of huge discounts for cosmetics. You can literally spend a day or two here burning a big hole in your pocket.
The same stuff all over,I personally find that there is nothing much to buy at Myeongding. Lots of Korean beauty and cosmetic products. Perhaps this place is good for the ladies as most of the shops carry clothes just for the ladies. 
Shop till u drop! ,"Need I add more?? The super famous area for the land of Korean beauty and fashion, u can find all the major beauty brands here. The amount of samples each shop gives out has dwindled over the years, but it's still a highlight while shopping for skincare and makeup here. It gets super crowded during the evening everyday, only thing I don't like is that the shops close at 10ish.. C'mon for the beauty Mecca that is Myeongdong, I expect the whole place to be alive till late. I went there around 10.30pm and all the streets were practically empty... Good if the shops close late."
Feel like im in China,"It was 2 yrs ago we visited seoul n myeongdong is our most disapointment.Sales assistant are rude,too pushy n dishonest.no offence but most are hired from china and were making us feelin so uncomfy to shop here anymore.Even some koreans are so unhelpful .We just to love this area the most.we witness our own eyes a tourist n local buying the tttopoki but paying won3000 but d local got a full portion n not d tourist.Please bring back the myeongdong we use to love"
Good Place for shopping!,"If you look for cosmetics, foods, then you must go this place!.. Buying cosmetics here, can easily get free samples! wow..."
Shopper's paradise,Myeongdong is full of activity and consists of all major world brands. The area is always crowded with tourist and shoppers. Korea is famous for cosmetics and all major Korean brands have pre sense all over. A very close to Seoul station and easily reachable
Best for shoppaholic!,"Korea is famous for their cosmetics and skin care. You could literally find all your beauty products in this area! There's also lots of restaurants around, when your tired just stop to any restaurant and rest your legs.The locals in this area are tourist friendly. They can communicate in English, Chinese, Japanese and of course Korean. Our hotel was in this area and some restaurants are 24hours. You don't have to worry about your midnight snack.Every night there a night market for you to try out their local street food and get some better deals than shops!"
Crowded Tourist-Central,I used to shop here pretty often a few years back; now it's a tourist-central area where the shop employees are pretty much required to speak in other languages to pull in foreign customers. I've had multiple instances where the employees approached me in Chinese or Japanese to try to sell me products (I'm Korean). I would recommend this place for tourists who want to do some shopping in Korea- it's THE place to shop in Korea.
Shopping paradise,"This is a true shopping haven for Korean cosmetics and for clothes in general, if shopping is your thing. It's very easy to go around. There are multi lingual guides you can talk to and they give out free maps of the area as well as of Seoul! The prices of the cosmetics is almost half what they are in my country so buying them here is a no-brainer. It does get a bit too busy so if you don't like crowds you might want to go when there are less tourists - a little before noon and after 7pm perhaps."
Shopping paradise,"As we spent two days there, it was so difficult for us to walk from one block to another. There are too many good things to shop for, including fancy air cushion powder as basic foundation and facial care products. We got lots of trial free samples as masks or sample size lotions. Gosh~ We really had a great time there. And there are even tourist center people wearing red clothes to answer your questions regarding to currency exchange or restaurant recommendation or tax refund."
Live and energizer,It is a very popular area for all ages . There are a lot to see and buy . You can find lots of things here from souvenir to cosmetics at very reasonable price . Also you can find lots of restaurants here . 
Huge outdoor shopping ,"Many of korean cosmetics store in here, restaurants etc. be careful not all of them can speak english, but they can speak mandarin. So, it will useful if you can speak little bit korean and mandarin."
For the shopping addict!!!,"I enjoy the just about anything can found here. The market people were so friendly. The food was outstanding and my little gifts to bring home to US. Yes, come and shop away here. The energy is cool!"
so much here!!!,Not one of the market areas but plenty of street vendors for food and such and tons of shopping--very very lively at night--safe too...we stayed in area and would never venture somewhere else for lodging...just too convenient.
Cosmetics Capital in Seoul!,"The first thing you'd notice in Myeongdong is the endless line of stores selling cosmetics and good quality beauty products more than the apparel and clothing stores. The best thing about these stores is that they are really affordable and darn will really create a dent in your pocket. You will never leave this area empty handed with all the high quality brands that are being sold at an affordable price, this place is really a cosmetic shopper's haven!"
Very nice atmosphere,"We had a hotel close by, and went to this area for breakfast and one time for dinner, which was good. However, the best part was during the evening with all the different food booths. Furthermore, there is a variety of shops for the shop-a-holic."
Shopping!!!,"If you are into cosmetics, this is the spot to go to. There is so much available, it can be mind numbing. Some of the sales persons can be a bit aggressive. At night, it turns into a night market with the standard night foods. Its a good spot to visit, but i think once it enough. Food wise, we ate the Kyoja noodle restaurant. That was quite good"
Plenty of shops,Rows of shops and stalls available selling apparels and local food. Very vibrant place. Good place to do some shopping and eating local food. 
Korean market to be visited!,In this market you can find really many shops and that sell every kind of face masks and creams! There is also the opportunity to have a foot massage and a complete body massager for a very good price. Order stuff you can finder are the cloths and a lot of food!!!
Great place to shop and eat,I'm staying at the Metro Hotel which is right in the neighborhood. Fantastic hotel by the way. I love this area. Plenty of cosmetic shops if you are into that sort of thing. Also starting in the late afternoon the food vendors come out. It's a pedestrian area which is pretty cool. Make sure to eat the tall swirly ice cream cones sold all over. 
good shopping,"We went here on the morning that we weare leaving , so we couldn't shop till we dropped but we did find quite a few bargains!"
Great place to experience korean street food,Obviously there are a lot of stuff to buy in myeongdong but you can also get too taste the korean street food. 
What you'd expect from any shopping district,"""Seen one, seen them all"" is unfortunately the phrase that comes to mind when I visited Myeongdong. If you've not been to a shopping district before, or have a particular purchase in mind then it's definitely worth a visit. Otherwise, Myeongdong can feel repetitive as in my opinion it does very little to separate itself for the dozens and dozens of other shopping districts."
Bustling shopping street,"If shopping were your interest, then it is a must. The whole area is packed with fashion and cosmetic shops as well as street food. As I didn't care so much for shopping, the food were interesting to sample."
Shopper's Paradise and Street-Food Mania!,"The energy at MyeongDong is very different to that of InsaDong and Dongdaemun. Once you get out of Exit #6 of MyeongDong Station (Line 4), you can already feel the wonderful vibe; most especially late into the afternoon and well into the evening. Your sense are immediately assaulted by the smells of grilled Octopus, warm Egg Bread, steaming Tteokbokki, and sizzling Sausages. My mouth is watering just from the memory of it! I don't know how many times I've returned to this place for each of my Seoul two trips. I keep coming back because of all the cafes, shops, cosmetic stores, clothing stores, and street food you can buy! Try the Jokbal, Grilled Octopus, Battered and Deep-fried Squid, Tteokbokki, fried Sausages, and Strawberry Mocchi! Don't forget to browse through as many cosmetic stores as you can because you will get a lot of freebies! you may also score some good finds if you do this so just feel free to enter stores. You'll never run out of things to buy in this place. It's alive with people! I could easily spend more than three hours at this place."
Unlimitied streetfood,"Despite it is a bit crowded, a bit expensive, but definitely try the street food at night in the Myeongdong area!"
"One stop shop for food, clothing, cosmetics, etc....for a price.","If you dont mind mob like crowds (lol) then go on! Busy during day, busier at night! This area has all the major international household brands like Zara, h&m, etc. if your looking for cosmetics.. Then look no further. Restaurants are a plenty but you need to look up as most restaurants are above ground level. Many boutiques as well but not cheap. For the same ""Korean"" (meaning not brand) merchandise better go to Edae (Ehwa women's university) where you can find similar items at least 20-30% cheaper."
My favorite place in Seoul! ,"Myeongdong is a heaven in Seoul!! Especially if you are a fashion addict and make up addict, it will be a heaven for you girls! The fashion stores there were so many and all of the clothing store are so dope! They have kind of fashion style many street style clothing store, feminine type of clothing store, glamour type of clothing store and etc. And for all of you who love to eat and chillin at coffee shop, don't worry cos in myeongdong you can totally find everything you wanna find for pet lovers, you guys should visit the dog and cat cafe here! Don't forget to visit myeongdong peeps! It's a must "
I just love this place,"I just love myeongdong ❤ you can find everything here. Foods, makeups, bags, and even cute oppars. (:"
Skincare and cosmetics ,"One stop area, good food ( street food, restaurants) , most Korean skincare brand there) and fashion.If you are looking at high end stuff, there is a lotte department store. ( global blue and another red tax refund company)Able to obtain tax refund in cash first but need credit card as deposit in case u don't clear custom(Global tax free - orange ) also in myeongdong area( inside a big olive young store level 2)There are also walking tourist information counter able to communicate in English , Chinese and Japanese."
Shopping-holic? Your paradise at 5pm everyday,"Enjoy the Korean style street markets every day, you can have authentic food , negotiate the prices, watch activities of performances and get your souvenirs. Remember the time, 5pm, be there or be square."
Shopping place for cheap goods.,The street is full of shops and I find very interesting as I can find many Korean products. Take the subway to visit.
tons of cosmetics shops,There are literally 100s of cosmetic shops with great deals for korean brands. Its easy to claim tax refund too. I was told by one of the tony molly staff that their items are cheaper than duty free lotte mall price. 
24 cosmetic shopping center,"I'll be back here and i'll stay at myeongdong area when visit seoul. Just prepare your credit card or debit card becoz your cash money never enough here. You can find so many cosmetics brand original from korea, cute coat, jacket, sweater, sweety n unique hat, souvenir and...also korean culinary...you must try it!!! Best place in seoul."
Cosmetics haven ,"Myeongdong was extremely crowded and filled with tourists. It's a town buzzing with plenty of street food stalls, shops, restaurants etc. Would recommend coming here predominantly to shop for cosmetics/ beauty products. Myeongdong is similar to Ximending (Taiwan). "
Beauty Care Paradise,Myeongdong is a good place for buying skincare and cosmetics. Some of the skin care shop has several shops there but their promotion may be different. Most of the shops gave us sample when we make purchase. It took us 3 hours just to shop here.
"Insanely crowded, but what a place ! ","This very confusing place has the usual stuff, quite a bit extra - and all the rest ! Confusing because it felt impossible to get a proper bearing to anywhere in the narrow packed streets. I was walking in circles instantly having no idea where I was. I was there Saturday afternoon and in the beginning it was possible to move about freely. As the clock passed four it crowded up heavily - almost to panic state, I felt. There must have been tens and tens of thousands of people. Still, possible to shop, eat and browse nevertheless. Heaps of small food stands serving everything from roasted chestnuts to deep fried squid. What a wonderful place, all the smell, all the people, all the things ... A must visit if in Seoul - and bring your compass ! "
Shoppers heaven,"I am not a shopper, I actually hate it but I was impressed. It's really cool area. Seoul seems to become more alive at evenings to than. It's near Namsan tower, I actually found Myeongdong underground market while I got lost coming down from N tower and was looking for a subway. Around 5pm the street food vendors come out in drones and the streets are filled with delicious aroma and the vendor themselves are sites themselves. There are cosmetic ladies promoting their product, bright lights everywhere as were many plastic surgery clinics. One was even named loosely translated ""You can't tell"" plastic surgery clinic with many ladies walking around in their yoga wear with bandages all over their faces. I thought I would hate Myeongdong because I hate shopping but it was highly entertaining place. May be I am just weird but I would just go there again for the street food and people watching. "
"Locals hate this place, but its a bustling, dynamic neighbourhood","My local friends never go here, they find it too touristy. I love the energy of the place, however, and its a great area to stay because its close proximity to lots of places to eat. The Nature Republic store in Myeongdong is apparently the most expensive commercial real estate in all of Seoul."
Shops selling the same stuff,"Myeongdong is alive at night. Bright lights coupled with street full of shoppers are a common sight. There are street hawkers which add on to the shopping experience. However, shopping can get a bit boring when all the shops are selling the same products on a different brand name. It is not uncommon that the same brand is operating on different alley in Myeongdong. I think it's a good experience to visit Myeongong to complete your skincare shopping list and satisfy your hunger. "
Nice Shopping Street,"Good for shopping,street food.fashion.cosmetics,cafe the travel information is quiet difficult to find but the officer is very helpful. They have Myeongdong map and know every shop in this street.They find K-pop store for me and call to the shop to check opening hours for me also."
Shop till you drop at 11pm,"This place really comes alive at night. Check out the street food stalls for just a few Won. The beauty shops are all next to each other, each with salespeople offering free face masks to lure you in the store. "
Great shopping heaven,"When come to purchase of cosmetic, Korea made handbags and fashional items, Myeongdong is the shopping paradise. The whole area also surrounded with all kind of museums such as Grevin wax museum, trick museum etc. The more than 100 years old Cathedral is located near the tourists information center office too. The Korean brand handbags such as MCM and Lapelette shops are located here. A lot of great food is selling in the restaurants and on the street. You can get the famous yellow herb Ginseng chicken with glutinous rice stuffed in It. The restaurant is located on 1st floor of a building opposite Innisfree cosmetics store near Eujiro 1. In the middle of shopping flea, you may take a break to have tea in between the desert shops such as famous green tea indulgence Osulloc. We found a great Korean beef barbecue restaurant opposite the triangle corner of Myeongdong subway station. Is the road lead to Seoil N- tower. After you seen the Myeongdong 7 eleven, you will find the restaurant opposite a hotel."
What a bazaar!,In this area you can really buy almost anything. Very crowded but also quite good fun to walk through the narrow streets and find new things to buy or eat. 
Shopping paradise,"Lots of shops and restaurants. Vibrant area. Unless you shop in brand name shops, the average shops are quite expensive compare to other area. "
"Sensory overload, but unique experience","This place is at its best at night when the lights come on avd the merchants and food vendors line the alley way! It is crowded. So MANY face ""fixer"" type shops!! Fix pimples, smooth wrinkles, face masks, chin lifters, etc! And those stores were packed!! Then there are department store type shops (H&M, Clark shoes, etc...). A lot of restaurants, coffee shops, pastery shops... Something for evry taste bud! We walked there under the streets via the subway entrances near The Plaza hotel. There's a whole mall under there too!"
This is a way how to spend your money in Seoul ^^,This is a way how to spend your money in Seoul. The clothes is very expensive hahahaha.. But this is heaven for cosmetics.. Many discount and promo. You must ask the cashier for free sample.
Lots to see and buy - especially face products,"Every night is a busy, vibrant night jam packed full of tourists and some locals. There is plenty to see and buy as well as plenty to eat and try. Definitely a place to visit as it is very tourist-friendly. If you like face masks etc, definitely go."
Such a cliche ,It's called them shopping center but there's nothing unique about it. Many western brands and mostly cosmetic shops. If you want to buy the same things that you can buy everywhere so this is the place for you
Skin care & Cosmetic Shopping Heaven,"You can most of the skin care & cosmetic over here. Most of the shops are giving free sample at the entrance by putting it in a shopping basket n hand it over to you. They will force you to enter the shop and if you do not purchase anything, they will take back the shopping basket whereby the free sample is still inside it. Noticed that a lot of the staff were from China instead of Korea. Communication could be difficult as they could hardly speak in English."
super busy,"for a westerner it's quite surprising how busy and vibrant this area is, lots of street food stalls with all kind of local specialities (seafood, meats, noodles, desserts...) Lots of beauty shops also, chainstores and trendy fashion shops for all kind of budgets"
Lots and Lots of facial stuff,"If you are into facial stuff, this is the place to get them. Almost every alternate shop is selling facial stuffs. Not only for women, but men as well.Clothings stall are a minimum. If you go after 7pm, the main street has some local snacks where you can try them. It starts to get crowded during that time. As for restaurant food, note that it is more expensive here than other parts of Seoul."
This District is a must visit for shopping and more,"Myeongdong is a very busy area with lots of street stalls and store fronts to see. If you like shopping, this is a place to visit. Keep in mind that not everything is a good deal. It is always very busy with lots of people. Kind of nice that it is closed off to cars. The streets all start to look the same after a while. Thankfully for us, there were Tourist Information staff walking around to assist those with questions and in need of directions. There are lots of shops that sell beauty related items. This is a good place to buy the Facial moisturizing masks. They are much cheaper here compared to buying in Hong Kong or Vancouver."
Jam-packed shopping ,If you love shopping this is the place to be. If you don't like walking that is packed and a little challenging but not impossible. The shop sales people will try to grab your attention and get you into the store but they are friendly and only doing their jobs. I don't like shopping but I loved it there and the street food was spectacular. Plenty of places to eat plus things to do. 
Fashion Streets - Myeong-dong,"Myeong-dong is Seoul’s shopping mecca and is a must-see for tourists, but it is not just a shopping destination; Myeong-dong is also a center of commerce, banking and culture with a daytime population of 1.5-2 million. For shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices.Myeong-dong’s street stalls are a real tourist attraction selling all kinds of items including belts, watches, ties and T-shirts. There are also street food stalls serving traditional Korea delicacies such as fish cakes, tteokbokki (a stir-fried dish made of rice cakes with vegetables in hot sauce) and soondae (steamed pig’s intestines stuffed with bean curd, soy bean sprouts, green onions, starch noodles and mushrooms).Migliore, easily accessible via Exit 4, Myeong-dong Subway Station, is a Myeong-dong landmark in the heart of the commercial area and offers tax refunds and multi-lingual information (in English, Chinese and Japanese) for international tourists."
shopping heaven,"if you love shopping this is where you need to go especially for cosmetics. its crazy how you walk in one street and then the next street looks identical cause its pretty much all the same stores everywhere. id recommend to go at night as the food stall holders are open and if you do, you have to try the ddokkbokki. it is seriously the best! they are sold by these two ladies and they sell it for 3000 won. oh and dont forget the strawberries!! they are the sweetest ive ever tried and the biggest. if you love eating and shopping myeongdong is the place to be. theres so much to do there "
I really dislike to shop....,"Based on my title, Myeongdong should be a place to avoid at all costs while in Seoul. To the contrary, you should visit. The whole area is an interesting place to watch people, take photographs or (sigh) shop. There are plenty of places to eat and the area is in central Seoul."
Shopping galore and food ,"Awesome food choices and so much shopping. If you're looking for anything beauty related, you will find dozens of shops here handing out freebies to get you to come in. The rice cakes are my favorite and are best from the stand at the end across from Lotte Hotel. Come at night and see even more food options. "
Very nice area,Nice area full of dining options. It's well known for shopping and no cars allowed. Busy during day and night. 
If you like cosmetics,"Myongdong îs the place to go.Mostly Korean breands,but miraculously they agree to western complexions as well.From Misha to Skin Food,Imnisfree, and a lot of other local brends,verything îs very affordable and worth buying.I'm a westerner with a very sensitive skin, allergy prone,and the only products I can use I buy from here."
Shopping time~!,Myungdong is a mandatory stop for every trip to Seoul. You can get anything and everything here. From food to clothes to cosmetics to whatever else you can think of. 
Middle class shopping galore ,I didn't find the clothes that inexpensive nor the food. But i guess its worth a try to try everything you see. They are all nice looking and clean. There are lots of sale when we get here this October. Its kinda middle class here
Shopping Shopping Shopping,This is the shoppers' heaven. Do nothing but shop till you drop.Shops mainly are cosmetics / beauty / clothes / accessories / shoes.There are also a lot food street food available along the streets.
Too many chinese sales!!!!,"While you enter myeongdong, just like get into china town. All sales spoke mandarin, if you don't speak, some of them even don't want to answer your question. All shops turned into different branded company, luckily, I still found 32cm ice-cream in a small shop =)"
Must Visit Although Its Touristy Place,Myeongdong is a very touristy place and that's the beauty of it. Love the lively night life with all the xiao che around the area. Shoppings are great too if you can find those little alleys where clothes are slightly cheaper than the main streets. I love the restaurants around there too where they offer plenty of local food. Both day time and night time are worth a visit as they give different feel!
A busy commercial area,"It is quite easy to reach Myeong-Dong since many tourist buy souvenirs in this area. So many choices available, and sold with reasonable price."
"Just shopping region, nothing more.","I don't recommend this place unless you like shopping.Crowded, noisy etc. I always disliked this region!!"
Just so so,"So crowded.rather than do shopping here,i'd rather do shopping in dongdaemun & gangnam station..But you can find shinsegae,lotte dept store,lotte cinema,lotte young plaza,avenue L,here.and it's near N Seoul tower.you can reach all of them by walking.."
Great Experience !!!,"Walking and shopping thru Myeongdong was such a great experience !!! ....I traveled with my family, we all had great time, you can find here a lot of stuff.During Winter time, it could be real cold .... you better check your forecast"
Too commerical,"The price here is generally higher than other shopping malls / streets / restaurants we have visited. Unless your schedule is tight, suggest you to go to other places for shopping / food."
Pretty Fun and Lots of Shopping,"We came here because my missus wanted to look at all the make up and stuff, as this area is famous for that.So I just walked around and looked at the various street stalls and street food on offer. I think typically it is quite same to eat the street food, but maybe you should be a bit weary of the squids and such because I had some and ended up with a pretty dodgy stomach.Apart from that, the rest of the stuff seemed fine, alot of the chicken skewers and noodles and such is quite tasty and pretty safe to eat.The area is a bit of a maze, and have essentially the same stuff as everywhere else, but it seems to give you more discounts and what not, so I suppose thats why people come here to shop. Didn't care for the shopping, but as a guy, there is probably still enough going on to keep me occupied for a few hours. "
A Nice Shopping Region,"Myeongdong is a nice and convenient place for shopping and dinning. It can be easily accessed by most public transportation. In addition, there are some friendly and helpful tourist ambassadors whom we can ask for directions and information. "
Latest Fashion Shopping,"Facial masks were plenty everywhere, trendy clothes, shoes and fashion accessories were all available in Myeong dong. At night, food stalls selling all kinds of food lined the streets. Everything is within sight and it gets especially more crowded on weekends. "
nice place for shopping,"Find so many things here. Fortunately I came her when Korea Grand Sale moment. So I can get more discount to shop cosmetic, and skin care here. "
Casual browsing!,"I spent about an hour here and thoroughly enjoyed the hype and the buzz. It was late afternoon and I had a dinner reservation, so I could not stay longer. I think one should allow 3 hours or more to see this place properly and shop. I did not buy anything since I did not have sufficient time. The place was packed with lots of foreigners as well as locals. I'm not so sure of prices as I did not inquire about anything. I read about this place on the Korean tourism website and a Korean business acquaintance took me there. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
Shop till you drop,"Do you love shopping? Then you are in for a lifetime of fun in the Myengdong street market, visit it at night and you can get almost everything you want to buy. Also note that you can get some discount cards in the City Pass + transport cards that you buy, so do not throw the instructional paper in it away"
Go only if you really like shopping or if you are forced to go,"Personally, not into shopping whatsoever. I often wonder why folks would buy stuffs from overseas and drag the goods all the way back home. Very unfriendly to the environment and leave a high carbon trail behind.Personally, I don't think the shops in the area are interesting. It's just a bunch of shops. What was interesting was the crowd. Especially all the male with 10 bags in their hands who were ""forced"" to wait outside of the stores while their girlfriends/wives/daughters/mothers went shopping. None of them seem thrilled to be in that area. Take a closer look next time you are in the area. The restaurants mainly catered to tourists and pretty much offered the same type of food. I don't think the quality of the food would deviate too much from one joint to the next. If you really like shopping, by all means, this place is a heaven on earth. If you are ""forced"" to go shopping in the area, find a good place for people watching."
Buy all your cosmetics/skincare here and forget about other places!,"Most stores give samples and freebies when you buy there (there were two that did not give us anything but we had huge discounts of like 50% so that's fine). Other places may offer some samples and freebies but nothing beats cosmetics/skincare shopping at Myeongdong. The shopping is awesome & there are lots of street food stalls, although it's more expensive than other places, possibly due to the large number of tourists in the area. There are money changers near the China Embassy if you need more money and Lotte is just opposite the street if you want to buy high end stuff. Must go even if you're not buying stuff - you can just eat there too, plenty of food options!"
Everything is here,"If you plan to shop in Korea, do it in one of the night markets and Myeongdong is one of those fascinating places. Many brands for make up may already be locally available but prices here are a real steal! And don't forget to try street food. Not all Korean food have kimchi in it. There's a lot of sweets too, freshly made in front of you. Great place to be and I feel safe here too! "
Shopping place,"Myeongdong is hectic on the weekend but love the atmosphere of shopping here. The cosmetic stores offer many cheap price with good quality. and there's a subway department store that we must visit, Located infront of the Myeondong area after IBIS Hotel. "
Heaven of cosmetic shopping!,"If you want to buy cosmetic like etude house, the face shop, tony moly, etc, you come in the right place. Enjoy free gift when you enter their stores! The price is cheap compare to my country so yes, buy a lot of cosmetics here girls!"
Shopping and streefod haven,"This is my 2nd time in Myeongdong last time was 4 years ago. I love the vibe here especially those food carts, I love trying different streetfood because that's party of traveling. I was able to try the noodles, dumplings, chicken skewer, corn, and fruit drink. There's a lot more variety to enjoy though.I looove how tourist friendly the place is.. with those tourist information guys in their red jacket and red hat. They're very approachable and very helpful in finding your way in and around Myeongdong. They have maps and can speak english as well or mandarin for chinese tourists.Though I was surprised this time cause when I went there 4 years ago they were speaking to me in Japanese but this time they were speaking to me in chinese. I also noticed that they were not as warm as they were before to customers entering their shops. I bought a lot of stuff before because of the way they talked and convinced me of their products. But now when I entered the store they just stare at me and they don't talk as much.I love how all the cosmetic shops are just beside each other but what's confusing though is that the same brand doesnt have the same discount. I think it's owned by different owners. I bought from SKINFOOD and as I was walking I saw what I bought in another skinfood store but half the price. SO better checkout the stores first before buying."
Extensive shopping area,"I visited Namdaemun and Myeongdong, preferring the former over the latter. Myeongdong is much bigger and busier, and you can't bargain as much with the vendors."
I found a Moslem Stall here haha,The streets food are really capturing my nose as I walk through the junctions and buildings. But as a moslem I cannot simply bought things which is doubtfull of the halal status. Suddenly.....when my wife are look a kids shoe at some corner I saw a moslem man selling grill squid on a stall..the price of a stick of grill squid is krw3000. I bought 3 stick and enjoy it well. The location Is if you walk from the post office/7 eleven go straight untill the last 2 left junction with shops. Go down and the stall is on the right side.
Shop and eat till you drop,Lots of shop and street shop for traveler to shop. Eatery is all around the corner with variety of food to choose from. Some even open till late night should you come in late of the night. Shop owner speak good English and Chinese beside Korean. 
It gets very crowded after 1pm,"It was pleasant strolling Myeongdong on Sunday; however, after 1pm, the pushcarts (mainly selling food) start to set up and the crowd starts to swell so it becomes congested which adds to the hype of the place. Try the Milky Bee rose ice cream gelato - it's good !"
Airport Taxi Cheated on Us,"When we walked distance to Chungmuro for going to airport back to home country. Someone with ""airport taxi"" van, asked us many times and bit compel to ride in. We ignored beacuse it would be expensive than train, but he asked the price was same. And many times ensured us that no problem with price. But, it was cheating, he asked big rate for our transport when arrived in Incheon. So be careful, even you are in the developed country."
Perfect perfect perfect place to do cosmetic shopping,"When I first travel to Seoul 11 years ago, Myeongdong is definitely my favourite. Time passed, and from my last trip there, I found it too crowded and mostly filled with cosmetic stores. You can found 2-3 same cosmetic brand store, on the same row, and repeated on the next row."
Busy Place,"We have been living in Seoul for 4 months and I don't think we have ever been past Myeongdong and its been quiet. Always lots going on, lots of food stalls, restaurants and shops"
A haven for shoppers,"The place is jam-packed with stores from food, restaurants and cosmetics. You can't even decide where and what to buy because you tend to buy them all. Alot of cheap and offered discounts to most of them."
"Skin care, street food and fashion...oh my!","Myeongdong may very well be Oz to shoppers looking for good quality bargains in all shapes and sizes. Our condo-tel was strategically located in Chungmuro, a mere 10 minute walk and our baptism to this popular shopping capital happened last week as we entered via the Myeongdong Cathedral on top of the main artery. Coincidentally, there are branches of Citibank and Standard Chartered flanking the entrance as if suggesting we pray first, withdraw Korean Wons next, then shop away. The whole place is organized frenzy. There are hundreds upon hundreds of shops lined up along the big maze. Skin care giants like Nature Company, Skin Food, Face Shop, Innis Free, etc, etc cannot be missed. Like convenience stores, they are everywhere - inviting shoppers to come visit their shop with a promise of big discounts, freebies and no pressure to buy (a promise kept, by the way). Fashion retailers also hold their own in the area: Zara and H&M attract everyone to their mega-stores with the latest in urban fashion. Street food dominate the center aisles with popular Koren treats, from savory to sweet enough to satisfy the hungry shopper. During our 5-day vacation, we were here everyday either for a meal or to go full shopping throttle. Our last hour was literally spent here with last minute shopping for last minute requests from home. Something we didn't mind. Wear comfortable shoes, come armed with big shopping bags, open your palate to good food and (try) to stick to an identified shopping budget...then enjoy!"
Mecca for shoppers !,"It is absolutely fun to shop at Myeougdong, lot of shopping malls, brand names, cosmetics, street foods. Love and enjoy shopping here a lot.easy access by train station line 3, Myeongdong station. Just walk out of the train and it is there ! "
Paradise!,"I loved this place especially in evening, during evening hours this place is bustling with street vendors, street food, tourist. It’s absolutely lively and interesting to visit for shopping right from Korean crafted jewelry boxes to foot wear, from magnets to key rings and on and on… Since we were staying in Myeongdong we visited almost every evening just to get the feel of the place.A must visit attraction."
"Busy, great for gifts","Area is great for bargaining, and making deals. VERY BUSY and you can see a mix of stalls with numerous types of wares for sale, from food, to trinkets, to clothing, jewelry, you name it its there for purchase. Very similar to itaewon at night. except in itaewon is where you can get replica high end fashion items. going early in the day to myeongdong you can get the local feel and people watch."
Great place if you like crowds and street food,Spend you nights going through the crowded streets filled with food vendors and shops selling clothing and cosmetics.
Superb way to spend your time and money!,"Ok, we all know this is an amazing place for buying cosmetics. Allow me to add that there are plentiful of cafes; and street food which opens from about half five; and there are many red-gowned tourist ambassadors who help you with directions (including to the downtown tax refund centers, of which there are many!!!); and there is also a stage where really high-quality art performances are held periodically."
Favourite place to be!,"I literally went to myeongdong everyday without fail, you just can't fault the place. There is amazing food, amazing people, cat cafes, dog cafes, kpop merchandise everywhere, beauty products. There is everything you could imagine at an affordable price!"
Shopping!,So many shops. Not enough time or money!And so much street food! I like this area. It is great. Come prepared to eat a lot and possibly spend a lot too 
Great area with a lot of buzz,Walking the streets of Myeondong is great fun. A mixture of department stores & street market. All the streets are packed day & night with shopping opportunities. At night it turns into a street stall with food & clothing stalls all around the area & goes until around 10pm
"Shopper's paradise, something for everyone - also checkout undergrounds","Shopping experience for anyone at all budget level, wear comfortable walking shoes & come prepared to explore what's above ground, inside malls & underground connecting to the train stations - and the crowds. We got tired mid-afternoon & stop at one of many indoor basement's food court's cafe for a break, directly under one of the major department stores ... great on a rainy day & stay dry, going from building to building. Street food vendors were getting ready for the evening & night market but many have been out all day selling items of interest to tourists & visitor, locals alike. Bargain hunters beware, prices aren't necessary inexpensive here in Seoul as standards of living are rather high and we're surprised how costly fresh fruits are sold on street corners & inside fancy supermarkets, wow - sticker shocks, it's ""cheaper"" at home in the USA. Come here in a group with friends, pick a meeting spot & time and go explore on your own for a few hours - you will need lots of time to walk around & experience it."
"Make up, clothes shop","Place to be if you are here to shop, my hotel was here and I never got bored with the shopping.Streets are always buzzing"
"Always filled with people, food and shopping","Myeongdong is one of my favorite place to visit when in Seoul. Skincare products, street food and shopping is endless. You can find basically most of the things here but some items might be more expensive due to the location and it is a tourist attraction."
Good shopping place,"For the people who like shopping, especially cosmetics and street food, it's a good place. I can shop for half a day!"
Shopping,So many shops and great street food . What more can I say. Must visit as the atmosphere is amazing. Does get very busy at weekends .
Myeongdong is the place to shop for everything,"A great little sushi bar located in the shopping area. great shopping for younger people, bit pricy though. Walking distance from most city hotels."
Good for Cosmetic Shopping,"If you are looking for all the available cosmetic stalls in Korea all at the same place, you have to visit Myeongdong. They have a variety of the famous Korean food like Korean fried chicken, BBQ, the rows of street food, and Sulbing. You definitely won't go hungry here, but the rest of the stalls selling clothes are slightly more expensive than the shops at Dongdaemun."
"""Hyper"" shopping is a joke","Well I have to put out there that I am indeed a guy and that you're getting this from a 6'1"" 30 something white guy who likes to shop, but usually name brand like items. My size is nearly impossible to find in any new or ""cool"" fashion... they just don't really make 'em to fit our larger frames over here, shoe's, no way, pants... you gotta be joking haha. Some 2-3XL can usually fit me if I'm lucky enough to find it? Socks are pretty cool here, but you can get that anywhere in korea. Purses or other knock-off materials, yeah sure, they have it, but you just as well to get it in any other shopping district. I'm not a real big fan of large crowds and the occasional aujeema elbowing me in the ribs as she passes me along the sidewalks that are overcrowded and packed. There are several cool places to eat along the way and the food is usually pretty good and priced low enough to not really get upset over the bill come time for the check.Parking... haha, don't make me laugh. Good luck with that one.If you're looking to do some bulk Christmas shopping ahead of the holiday maybe it is worth it... but for me, I just don't think its worth the aggregation."
Good place to shop,"I love Myeongdong very very much! This is a good place for shopping and lots of restaurants too! Very hipped place where you can find the latest fashion here. Lots of street food too, yummy. You can shop til you drop :PBus ticket can be bought from the airport and stops right here.I always stay at King Sejong whenever I visit Seoul and Myeongdong is just next door.The subway is just around the corner too, very convenient."
LOVE TO SHOP,"Amazing shopping area! Lots of food to choose from! Can spend hrs. shopping,eating,having coffee. Easy access to Myeongdong from Metro or bus. City hop on bus easy to use!"
Prepare your money to shop,"Always crowded at night, a lot of street foods, cafes and restaurants in this area. Best place to shop for cosmetics as you can find any brands there with more than 1 outlet for each brands (e.g. Banila co., Innisfree, Nature Republic, Etude House, Olive Young etc.). Though it's indeed a shopping paradise for tourists, tourists who can't speak in korean may be treated impolitely sometimes."
Myeondong Shopaholics Paradise!,"Shopaholics paradise! Great for skin products and cosmetics. We spent a bit over 2 weeks in Seoul and must say we spent most of our cash here! Plenty of shops to choose from, where it be skin products cosmetics, clothes or shoes. Must do on your list if visiting Seoul!"
"Cosmetics, Free Hanbok To Try!","The place to shop for cosmetics!!! And to try FREE hanbok in Seoul Global Cultural Center located in M Plaza (you have to take the picture yourself, but you can always work together with other travelers to take turn taking pictures :D)"
Shopping Paradise,Great shopping for facial products and apparels! Street food are good too. But will get a bit lost as there are many lanes within the area which will get disorientate. There are many repeated stores within the entire area too. You will get to see similar shops every few hundred metres. 
My hubby's fav place,"The most popular shopping district in Seoul regardless of fashion, cosmetic, food, money changer, departmental stores, etc...We stay in Seoul 10 nights, we'd been there 4 nights! Because my hubby love to go there. If you want to go there, be prepared it is insanely packed with tourists and locals. If you plan to buy cosmetic products and if times permitted, shops few stores and compare the promos. Same brand may have different promos and always ask for samples! Small tips, you can check out some of the travel blogger site or Korea Travel site, they will have some discount coupons which have further 5% disc if you purchase exceed certain amount. The only disappointment or frustration, the Etude House that near H&M, they offer free cosmetic set to China tourist for purchase over a certain amount. I""m not China tourist but I can read Chinese. The sales ppl told me I'm not eligible for the free set because I'm not holding China Passport even if I bought over that amount. So, they only welcome China tourist and my spending in their country or in their shop is not valuable at all? What a shame ..."
Average market - nothing special,There are better markets in Seoul to explore... This one is quite average. If you don;t have much time in Seoul - Skip this one.
Shopping for fun,"Myeongdong is one of the best shopping center in Seoul. You can find all item from make up, clothes, food and many more. Opening from 7.00 am this market is open until morning in a few place but mostly the stores closed at 12.00 pm. This place can reach from myeongdong station or euljiro 1 exit 5 or 6. The price could be negotiate if there is no proce tag. If you love shop this place is the place you must come."
A little disappointing...,"Visited a couple of times during a 5 day trip to Seoul and since I've gotten into Korean beauty products, Myeongdong was on my must-list. The place itself is insanely packed with both tourists and locals. Most of the stores are repeats (ie multiple Etude House, Missha, Nature Republic, Innisfree, Tony Molly) but I can't tell if they are independently run because your experience varies but the products and prices are the same. There are a few that were not as ""mass"" such as Shara Shara and Mediheal (both of these stores' staff I found were nice and helpful!). If you go, bring lots of patience and get used to the idea of being followed/hounded by sales people (can't be quite claustrophobic to westerners used to ""personal space"") and trying to sell you packages of facial sheet masks in the dozens (I was looking for personal use not for re-sale). Most of the staff are nice and really just want to help (most don't speak English though). The exception seems to have been the massive Nature Republic near Uniqlo by the main entrance. Not only did the sales lady follow me around but apparently I was too slow to decide to buy anything so she took my basket away and basically pushed me out (oh and the ""free"" gift in the basket that they push on to you as you enter because apparently it's only for buyers. I wouldn't have been so peeved if I hadn't bought many other products from the same store the day before. If you go, go for the experience (the street food was good too) but be warned. Except for a few relatively 'unique' stores that's harder to find elsewhere like Shara Shara, all the other stores can be found everywhere else in Seoul where it's less crowded. I'd probably skip next time. Like another reviewer said, Lotte Department store in Myeongdong may be a better option (the duty free shop is even crazier though!) where you'll find the higher end beauty products that's hard to find outside Korea."
Great shopping place,"A great place to have good Korean food, good bargain, good shopping! It's a big place so it will take a long walking!"
Shop till you drop,"So muc to see and buy. Great for clothes, makeup and what ever your heart desires. The ""rose"" ice creams are superb."
Shopping ,"It is a must see place if that sentence make a sense lol anyway even if you aren't planning to do some shopping, you'll enjoy it ♡ "
Very busy,The shopping prices are very inconsistent you may see a similar item in a no name shop for ₩17000 next shop it would be ₩40000 and quality wasn't different. Good tourist place for shopping but many similar shops no matter where you go in south korea.
Live and vivid,"Visiting the streets in here is a unique experience. The place is lice and vivid with. A variety of stores, eateries and coffee shops. Neon signs and posts complete the feeling of Seoul. A must see"
Great place to stay for tourists,"Safe, clean area full of restaurants, street vendors, and stores (never seen so many ""facial product stores"" in one place). Great place to stay if you are a tourist or visiting Seoul for the first time. Close to subway lines/"
good night life,a good place for bargain shopping/ night life/ food. a must for leisure travelers. Evenings are crowded and entertaining.
CRAZY!,"It is nuts how bumpin' this place is, especially during the Chinese National holiday. These shops all have individuals who speak Chinese and even special sales for the amount of Chinese tourists that come through there. It is so easy to get turned around and lost. You can find a ton of knock of items; cosmetics; accessories and named brand clothing. I totally raided jeans at Forever 21 on sale, #teacherproblems only wish I had bought more...Street food around here is stellar as well but bloody expensive!"
Shopping heaven!,"A great place to shop! Many street food can be found there. One can also visit the Myeongdong Cathedral, which is really beautiful. Definitely a must-go!"
Exhiliarating,"This is probably the best shopping area that I have ever been to. It is much better than West Nanjing Road in Shanghai. It just seems to have a great blend of the traditional Korean, mainly street food; and the modern. You can pretty much buy anything that you want. Just realize that there are a ton of people in a very tiny area, so if you don't like a lot of people, then this is not for you."
Good place for Korean Street food and shopping,"A must go tourist shopping place. Good place to shop cosmetic products and facial masks with most of the brands. There are many street food stalls selling traditional Korea snacks: Hotteok (Korean pancakes : crispy, and chewy fried dough with brown sugar), Teokbokki (dukboki) – Korean rice cake or fish cake covered with hot red chili sauce)...etc. New invention foods such as Potato Tornado (a long spiral shape thin slice fried potato), Egg Bread (a sweetened dough that is topped with an egg and cooked in a mini oven, the yolk is still a little runny) ... Don’t miss the Daiso shop, you can get the famous Korean Edison chopsticks - IQ development patent chopsticks for your little kids. Across the street, there is Lotte Department store. There is a supermarket in basement, you can buy some Korean local food, snacks, crackers, seaweed… However, the store closed (except only two floors for tax free shops are opened) for two days for Mid-Autumn festival."
The shopping haven in Seoul,"This is the place to shop in Seoul - where the locals go! Unlike in Gangnam, prices here are reasonable and if you know how to bargain its a plus."
Crazy Shopping,I always come here when i need to buy my skincare products and cosmetics. They have all the brands here plus there are a couple of good restaurants here. My favourite being the SamGyeTang restaurant (it's a little hard to locate since there are so many different lanes that lead to different streets...) The downside is that this place is super touristy and always packed with people...so be mentally prepared if you are heading down to Myeongdong. 
perfect beauty shops,loved this place. shopped almost 100 kind of facial masks and beauty products. very nice ambience and crowd
Must go place for women! Cosmetics; apparel and non apparel shopping place,"Lots of cosmetic stores available; shopping district. Better at afternoon till night since there will be more pop up stores available selling Korean street foods such as mung bean pancakes; fried squid; etc. Korean cosmetics are far more cheaper than in our home country, and we've brought so many here since Korea is famous for its cosmetics products. "
Bit of a letdown,"Touted as the best of the shopping districts in Seoul, was really a bit of a letdown...it was just a mindless repetition of shops selling the same make up items interspersed with a few shops selling mobile accessories...prices n items are literally similar in all shops, so it's gets boring quite quickly ..what's worse is Korean dealers are the worst in terms of bargaining...they don't ever reduce prices which is weird for a "
THE place for street food in Seoul!,"We have visited this area twice during our short trip to Seoul. My wife and I love the street food options and there is so much energy in the area that it is so much fun to walk around and take it all in! There is plenty of shopping to be done in every direction, but the on-street happenings are what we enjoyed the most!"
"Seoul myung-dong, dongdaemun","HiJust before I went shopping at myung dong, and dong daemun.There r lots of goods I want to buy ..clothes, cosmetics, souvenirs..etc.. It' pretty cool place. But I became uncomfortable.. because of the mountain of shopping goods.I just wondering if I can courier my luggage and box containing goods from my accomodation in Jong-no area to Incheon Airport ? If so, what are the charges and How long does it take the time for delivery?Thank you."
Must see place for tourists,This is the place that every tourist have to see. Many shopping places in this area. Atmosphere is great! Only minus was that it was little hard to find a bar and take a beer.
"Cosmetics shops Myeongdong, Seoul",Plentiful of cosmetics shops around this place. Most of the lady at the shops speaks good mandarin language and some can be very unfriendly and rude.... Not all shops gives free sample... must not forget to ask for some.
Shopping Galore,"This is a shoppers dream, everything you need - from clothes, shoes bags and specially cosmetics... You can also find interesting food carts around the area and it is a must that you try one of this street foods. You can shop until the wee hours of the morning and the choices are endless."
Myeong-dong shopping paradise,Myeong-dong is one of Seoul’s main shopping district and it is filled with stores that line up the streets. The place comes to life when night falls and the brightly lit buildings look even more spectacular against the dark sky.
Amazing shopping street and very strategic,"An awesome shopping spot. Etude, Nature Republic, The Saem, Lush, Urban Dollkiss, Hello Kitty Cafe, Wonderbra, etc etc! You name it, this shopping street will probably have it. On one of the end of the shopping street is right across Lotte Mall (there's also the duty-free mall!).Most of the stuff you buy at shops here is tax-refundable (look for stickers outside the shop, I forgot what they were called but they have tax something written on it), but refund them if you have a morning or probably very late night flight, since the queues can be VERY long, my mom has said. We had a morning flight so it had just opened and only had one or two people queueing.IF: You are buying stuff for yourself, then please do so accordingly. However, IF you are planning to buy gifts for others, I suggest buying stuff at the nearby Lotte Duty Free mall. You pay cheaper for buying in bulk, basically. Buy the Korean brands though! If you buy the imported ones at the duty free mall, you'd have to pick them up at the airport (which can be a hassle). I went crazy with all the cosmetics around--- I wished my makeup stock was low so I could buy more stuff without feeling too much guilt hehe!!!Food: There are lots of food stalls in the middle of the road, but there are less amount of stalls during the day. There are also restaurants and snack shops available.Short on cash? Worry not! They have banks somewhere in the middle where you can get money out of the ATM from. I stayed at Sejong Hotel so the nearest was a Woori Bank.Language: Many of them speak Mandarin Chinese instead of English (some of them are actually even from Mainland China), so if you don't speak Korean but speak Mandarin, that's a plus. Hoards of tourists from China often come here to shop, so many of them are trained to be fluent in Chinese.In restaurants, they usually do not accept gratuities. My mom once offered tips but they refused.All in all, just prepare to shop and spend lots of cash :') here, the shops are not haggle-able, but is tax-refundable (above 30k Won)."
Gathering of renowned brands,"This district is a gathering of renowned international & local brands. Many shops offering merchandises of fashion goods, restaurants, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, accessories, etc..."
Great Shopping and Eating Heaven of Myeongdong,"Friends and work colleagues recommended me to stay in Myeongdong as this was my first visit to Seoul, Korea. They told me I will never regret it. So I booked a great hotel Skypark III hotel and I couldn't believe it was a great bargain! Reasonably priced, situated in the middle of Myeongdong district. Right in front of the hotel is the Myeongdong underground train station. Behind the hotel is a big maze of fabulous shops and eating outlets. I was always out and about going to touristy places since the underground train was just downstairs. In the evening I spent most of my time looking and buying stuffs from those lovely Myeongdong shops and also had tasty Korean and Japanese dinners from those eating outlets. I truly loved my 6 night stay in fabulous Myeongdong area. Superbly convenient!"
Overated,Tourist trap ...no high end brands and totaly crowded..for teens and cheap shopping....spend a hour max and go to Lotte instead
Great walking street!,"Good food, shopping and home to the Nanta theater with an amazingly funny cooking show. Worth the adventure :D"
Lots to do ...,"Must visit. Not to be missed if you are in Seoul. Even if not to buy anything, window-shopping is still fascinating."
An Assault On The Senses,"I have a feeling this is one of those places which you will either love or dislike. If you love crowds of people jamming into every available space, in every nook and cranny shopping their wallets out - especially if it's cosmetics of every variety - then this is the place for you.For me, I can't stand crowds, much less shopping with them, and as for cosmetics, I'm a guy and not one of those that would have any use for them. However, what I do love about this place is exactly that. Standing in a vantage point, observing the maniacal and frenzied rush of hopeful consumers desiring to partake in a menu of elixirs and creams that promise them eternal youthfulness, was certainly a sight to behold.Besides, there is so much more to see and experience ... the street food, fashion stores at every corner, and more food, and then some.If you're ever in Seoul, and you don't willfully subject yourself to the collision of senses that is Myeongdong, you have truly missed the essence of Korean culture - one aspect of it at least."
Get your shopping done quick and easy,"Myeongdong is amazing, half of our bags were free samples when we left. If you are really effective you can go through it in a couple of hours and it's so fun, I have never seen this many cosmetic stores in one place before, there is also a ton of other stores worth checking out. The cafe's are super cute and you can relax while looking out seeing your fellow frantic shoppers buzzing around from store to store. This street is basically a shoppaholics dream"
MYEONGDONG STREET,"We visit there 2 times, more busy night time, full of young vendors , skin care shops and restaurants, street grilled food, shops are open late night. Undeniably a place worth sit in the corner and checking beautiful things around you. Finally I find a good toilet, I went to SAVOY hotel."
Myeongdong,Yes this is the place where most of us will shop for all kinds of beauty products. All lot of stores are repeated. But not forget some good restaurants are located around that area.
So much shopping - in a maze of people!,"Shopping, shopping, shopping galore! Great for pretty much anything when it comes to buying - a lot of people say it's good for buying the Korean beauty products, which it is but there is also much, much more! I would say that the street food is a good attraction too!"
Something for nearly anyone here,"So many cool little (and big) shops here in Myeongdong. It's a pretty busy shopping district, and the movie theater is pretty nice, but it gets crowded fast, so keep that in mind. Street and food vendors are littered everywhere - speaking of which, if you buy from a food vendor, you can hand the trash they gave you the food in back to them when you're done and they'll throw it away, which is good to know since it's often hard to find trash cans in Korea. Restaurants abound here, many of which are very western, but there are tons of Korean places too. You can buy quite a few cute things for 1.000 won each, so I was in love. :)"
A quick visit is more than enough,"The entire street is packed with tourists and street vendors that cater to foreigners and those looking for ""discounted"" cosmetics. It's overwhelming and loud with Kpop and dubstep blaring from the stores wherever you shop. It's not for faint of heart and honestly just not great, unless of course that is your thing. Products being sold are the same sort being sold throughout Asia and at the same prices. If you do however visit, pass through the main ""myeongdong"" street, cross the stream to the opposite ""youth"" area which caters to locals and is a slightly less hectic and more pleasant, also offering up authentic street food. Stores such as the Lotte Department store close rather early, so keep that in mind if you are intending to stop by."
Cosmetics and Skin Care Central,"The Myeongdong shopping area is heaven to fans of Korean cosmetics and skin care products. Here, you will find streets lined with the famous Korean cosmetic brands, such as Laneige, Nature Republic, TonyMoly, Skin Food, etc., where you can get really good deals. Also close by are excellent restaurants, like Gogung which is famous for its bibimbap.At night, Myeongdong shopping area comes alive with street vendors setting up shop. The stores are open well into the night. This place was still hopping close to midnight. Definitely a place worth checking out if you visit Seoul."
"If you are looking for Korean cosmetics with good deal, come here","Many Korean cosmetics to shop , but I was not Korean cosmetic FC, my friends did buy a lot, they're enjoy shopping there very much.They went twice. Very interesting that , Korean cosmetics , put snake venom, bee poison, snail extracts and many strange ingredients, the sealers were all very friendly.They would greet you with free sample when you bought something, very smart sale."
Lovely shopping!,"I totally love these streets! It has all kind of shopping (modern, Korean, American shopping etc.), food markets, restaurants and so on. "
shopping,lots and lots of cosmetics and facial products at very reasonable prices. many eateries and plenty of street food stalls. my friends and i spent more than half a day there.
It's shopping time!! ;D,"There are many vendors you can check and I got quite a lot of earrings here. They are so cheap!!! It's definitely a perfect place to pick a few gifts for your friends or yourself!! And yea tons of beauty cosmetic stores around the area!! It's always on sale and they offer Japanese and Chinese language service!! Okay, some of them might not be very friendly but it's alright. You get what you want cosmetics are good price and that's it. Recommend to come here for everyone especially girls!! Have your money ready!!!"
Great street walking and shopping experience,"Endless street s full of vendors , shops and restaurants . Many bargains to be had . Lots of entertaining shops and experiences , from live music , to street grilled food , to a cat petting cafe , to American authentic bars and food, to Korean fashion and face and body creams . Some high end stores also exist . Great place to go with family , nibbling and shopping and walking ."
Myeongdong Shopping,"Happening side for shopping especially korean cosmetic products. All type of facial mask, cream, losyen from tip of hair to toes. Cheap allovera gel and if lucky enough to collect free samples. Paradise shopping for teenage or those K - Pop fans. A bit high end shopping with moden style and lighting compare to near by Namdaemun street market."
High octane shopping - especially on a Friday evening,"My local hosts & I went to an early performance of the cooking Nanta show which entailed fighting through the traffic and shoppers to find the theatre and a similar experience afterwards when leaving.Indeed we attempted a short shopping spree after the show in the Myeondong area, but this being a Friday evening the place was packed. If you want to see an orderly but still chaotic blend of street stalls, street food and high class department stores then this is the place to head for."
Nice place for shopping,"A lot of shops to buy from, many food shops also, you can find all what you are looking for, worth a visit."
The Bazaar of All Bazaars in Korea,"A visit to Seoul will never be complete without visiting Myeongdong. Whether you are looking for beauty products, music, clothing or food, Myeondong is the right place to be at. Visiting this place on a late afternoon is good, but coming here at night is a lot better. Everything is bright in Myeongdong at night. Street foods are reasonably cheap and money exchange shops can be found everywhere."
Shopping paradise~,"Here you can find anything and everything you need. Bags, cosmetic, clothes, accessories, shoes, food, etc.. Remember to bring a big bag to put all your purchases, if not you will be holding dozen of bags in your hands and it is very heavy (speak from experience). You can always go to any restaurants or cafes to rest before continuing the shopping spree. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be shopping non-stop! There are many brands of cosmetic or facial products, look out for their sales! You won't want to miss this place when you are in Seoul~"
The Grand Bazaar of Seoul,Great are to browse for cheap and mindless items. Weird food everywhere. People from all over the world. 
Shopping paradise!,Super shopping for girls! My friends literally went berserk at all the shops available and all the sales! 
Shop till you drop,Oh boy shop till you drop well my feet were sore by the end of the day. Bags food clothes shoes army gear phone covers just go and immerse yourself at this huge market day and night . I bought about 4 handbags jewellery t shirts and we eat the yummy food and drank at the cafes 
Great for shopping for Korean cosmetics ,"A lot of people, you can almost all Korean cosmetics brands here,Also a dog cafe . Downside is just too crowded inside , that equals to a noisy shopping experience, if you don't mind then it's ok "
Cat cafes!,"Best shopping in Korea. Lots of street food and restaurants and cafes. There are often little concerts or interesting cultural activities going on there. Expect lots of crowds though, I'd recommend not going on a Saturday or Sunday if you can help it. "
Street food,"Go there for the street food not shopping. They sell skin care products for Chinese tourists. The food is varied and inexpensive. Sausages, seafood, meatballs. Visit during late afternoon or early evening."
worth an evening's visit,"Large shopping area, more interesting early evening, 6-9. Many multi-storey stores, so go in with a plan. "
Somewhere to round up your evening after dinner.,"After dinner at InSadong and it was 10pm but all the shops and cafes were shutting. We felt it was too early to go ""home"", my Korean friend has suggested Myeongdong. It was still hustle and bustle with many street vendors selling stuff, the stores and all the eateries were still opened - yes! We have come to the right place to round up the evening. "
"Incredible Sights, Sounds, and Tastes","Kind of like a mercantile Superman: mild mannered reporter in the day, super hero at night. Same for Myeong-dong: rather hum-drum during the day it just explodes at dark with all the spirit of Korea's incredible young people, wonderful street food, and frenetic shopping. None of the street merchants take credit cards so take plenty of Won to spread around so many delicacies in 1K to 3K increments which are invariably prepared and presented with flair."
Nice but not cheap.,"Nice, but not cheap, you can find the same items in other areas for a fraction of the cost. You also have to make sure items are made in Korea, otherwise if items are from China quality are not as good."
Too busy and overpriced,Said to be THE place to shop in Seoul but even on a sunday afternoon it was far too busy and we just shuffled from one end to the other. Was happy to go there and experience it but would rather shop in the markets (both above and under ground)
Don't feel like Seoul but like a China Town,"way too many mainland China vistors, the tourist speak mandarin, the store promote in mandrain, and even the salesperson are also Chinese."
A fun yet bustling adventure ,"If you hate crowds, avoid this area on weekends like the plague. You'll see many Japanese and Chinese tourists everywhere trying different Korean snacks or shopping for cosmetics. I still enjoy it. It's a very fun place to see all kinds of unique people there and delicious street food which combine for a photo haven for professional photographers or wanna-be photographers like myself. If you're super adventurous you can go to N Seoul Tower during the day and come here at night. Just be aware of the peak times: Friday nights and Saturday nights."
Fun and busy location,"Certainly a ""chicks"" area due to the stores and cosmetics. Worth a walk around just to experience it - certainly some interesting sights!"
Tourist Shopping Zone,"Probably a fun place for tourists to shop but it is super crowded (especially at weekends). There are helpful tourist volunteers around the streets who can help you if you need to find something.In the open street areas there are wall to wall Korean cosmetic shops and each one has a pushy salesperson out front trying to get you in to the shop. Some even give you free samples just to go inside and look. There are also international clothing chain stores like Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21 etc. The small side streets have plenty of coffee shops and small local restaurants. In the early evening many food stalls set up on the streets to make a night market. At the edges of the area there are big Lotte and Shinsegae Department stores as well as underground shopping malls. A chaotic, frenetic place to shop and If you like a peaceful shopping experience it is not the place to go. There are plenty of other places around Seoul that sell the same things."
Shoppers Heaven,"If you like shopping then this place is for you. It's chaos, noise, food, shopping and more chaos. I loved the craziness and the food."
Pretty cool but not big as I expected,"Pros:Good exchange ratesMany street food Diverse stores/items for saleClean and easily accessible Cons:Sales people are nice when you enter the store but rude if you decide not to purchase especially at small boutiquesNot a lot of western restaurantsOvercrowded, Asian people do not know how to walk. They walk in a zig zag way and some refuses to move.Don't offer a public restroom facility. I had to use where I was dining."
Shop til You Drop!,"Love ir here! All the skin care you thought you ever wanted! I stock up on skin care every year I visit. There are also many clothes stores, cafes, restaurants and street vendors too! A good place to people watch."
Shopping-Makeup-skincare galore! ,"If you have plans to go shopping in Seoul, this is the right place! Even spending half day here is not enough to explore all blocks. Every store has it own charm for you to buy something. I recommend shoppers to stay around Myeongdong atleast for 1 night to have a satistsfying shopping experience. There are several hotels to choose. "
Buzzing place with a lot of character!,"I spent so much time talking around the markets and although they sell cosmetic products all day long, its fun to walk around even if you are bored! its pretty much open all day long but the street foods really come out in the afternoon when its cooler and its totally buzzing at night!"
Spots for Skincare,All the skincare brands can be found in Myeongdong. Highly recommend 1st time traveller stay in this area if you like shopping.
"very nice, will love to come again.","favourite shopping place.too many things to shop,so much cosmetics and skin care product. a lot of things to buy."
Evwrything you need at a place.,"A touristic area but prices are all reasonable. you can get cheap clothes at Milgiore, good Korean BBQ or other authentic cuisine in the streets, and the most famous cosmetic and skin care shopping of the country. Don't miss the street food too which will normally start their business after 5pm till 10pm."
shopping,I bought very nice and modern shoes and had good lunches in the small restaurants in the streets. You can spend lots of time here
Buzzing with life,"The Myeongdong has the feel of a market - everywhere there are people selling stuff in the street, you have the street kitchens but you also have stores with different brands Addidas, Nike etc it is a nice experience if you like a lot of people, noice, smells and kaos "
Fantastic place,My apartment was smack in the middle of this place and it was super convenient. Wait till evening to explore when all the street stalls open up. Heaps of unique food!
"From food to beauty, there are here. ","There are many food stall along the street. I love them so much. For me who didn't eat meat, still there are much for me to try. I love their ""screw like potatoes"", and I think you should try it too.Best for shoppaholic. You can get shoes, clothes, cosmetic and many more at reasonable price.It open until late night. "
Crowded shopping streets,"It's best to go in the afternoon when most stalls and food areas are open. But if you were shopping for younger and smaller styles, this place is not for you. I found that this place is more for bigger and older clientele. I didn't like the street food either. I think Bankok is much better on both fronts."
Nearly can find everything,"Lots of cosmetics and skincare products you can find, but may not be with the biggest discount.Lots of good local food too."
Myeongdong,"Has just about anything you could want! Lots of shops, street food, some great restaurants, cinemas. "
Shopping Food Shopping,"So many beauty and facial shop in here...i was kinda lost as i saw sooooo many same shop in this are such nature republic, tony moly, skin food and etc. They said you can get a lot's of free sample from the shop but from what i experience was, they will ""pull"" you into their shop and ""opps"" your money fly away~~ food from the stall was nice, souvenir are quite expensive."
Shopping!!!,"A shopping & eating heaven! We were there during the MERS period, so it was not as crowded as before. This was great for us to shop & we were given much more free samples. There were many restaurants around the area too. "
Street food and more,"Must go for quintessential korea tourist experience. Place to go for, beauty products, one of a kind socks and all the big brand stores. "
A heaven for shopaholic,It's a heaven for shopaholic! You can shop tons of make up and skin product as well as clothes and accessories
bit expensive for a budget shopper,"very happening, fashion hand phone casing, cosmetic and more but price is way too high for a budget tourist. "
Shopaholics Heaven,"Loads of shops, cafes and restaurants. Travel light with a half empty suitcase to Seoul, hit Myeongdong and fill that suitcase! Just in case you run out of space, you can always buy a extra suitcase at Myeongdong."
Forget everywhere else!!,"You here about London, New York, Paris etc. They have nothing on this place!! I have never seen so many shops in my life!! There were shops within shops, shops on top of shops. It really is a shopping paradise!! Even if you don't like shopping there will be something here for you I guarantee. My top tip is to go in the evening. The whole place lights up!!"
shopping mecca for knicks knacks,"this is the shopping mecca of korea, you name it you will find it here at myeongdong, one stop shopping for everybody. not only fashion will you get here, food too, lot and lots of street food vendor serving various different delicacies u never imagine in your wildest dreams, when in korea do not forget to visit myeongdong."
Shopping heaven for beauty-related products,"Heaven for all makeup/skincare lovers! Etude House, Aritaum, TonyMoly, Laneige/Iope/Mamonde flagship stores, Nature Republic, Skinfood, you name it, you got it. The sales assistants will lure you to enter their stores by giving freebies (sheet masks usually). I get more freebies than actual products by shopping in Myeongdong (for some reason I get less freebies in other areas such as Insadong or Dongdaemun). The area is just massive! There are more than one store for each brand so be sure to walk around as they have different discounts or offers in different outlets. I highly recommend for you to try the shaved ice in O'Sulloc and Sulbing. Money exchangers near Chinese Embassy have good rates."
Large shopping area with pushy salespeople,"All the major brands are consolidated here. Crowded shopping area which is good for beauty products but the salespeople (especially those from China) are extremely pushy. Every beauty shop has salespeople handing out small samples sachets but if you don't buy anything, they will take it back so don't bother. If you do buy, ask for more free samples, which they will give. Go to Seoul Global Cultural Centre @ M PLAZA, level 5 to get a map of the area and try out the traditional costumes for free. There is also a good cooking school - Seoul Kimchi Academy House, located next to M Plaza. For Hello Kitty fans, there is a cafe located at 100 – 810, 28, Myeongdong 4-gil, Jung-gu but I would strong recommend visiting the one at Hongdae which is bigger and prettier. Lots of good restaurants in this area too. Look out for the street stalls that come out after 4pm."
NICE PLACE TO SHOP,"it is very nice place to shop mainly in the night. you can find mix of goods brands, food and Kiosk. although crowded but must visit place. Also lots of beauty products and cosmetics."
"Myongdong, a great place to shop!!!","GREAT PLACE TO SHOP! We shopped in SPAO, H&M, Face shop. Buying for yourself and family is a treasure since the prices are low and there are great bargains. Since I have teen agers, they just shop on their own without me worrying on their safety coz there are areas with WIFI and we easily communicate. There is a coffee shop, Starbucks, which is a good place to stay while kids go around to shop as whiel we eat and drink coffee. Also once you stepped out , there are so many stalls to shop for small and big items you can take home as give aways. There are also sellers of street food that are clean and healthy. Our shopping escapade was fantastic!"
cheap but stuffy.,there were so many food shop and very cloudy.becareful not to leave the hand of small child there are bunch of small store they atracted all the time.but also fun and cheap deal for shop.
One of the top places to go shopping in Korea,"Pros:Live atmosphere at night: there are street performers and sometimes guerilla concerts. More shops than you would expect: From old ladies selling socks to souvenir shops and department stores. I would consider this place to be the mecca of fashion.Food: Lots of street vendors and many restaurantsCons:Too crowded: certain days and certain times, it can be very hectic. The feeling is like Time Square,NYC."
nice place to shopping some brands,"a place to shop around the night. A lot of famous brands, with some street foods and kiosk. Just next to the Catholic Cathedral."
Usually Crowded,"Can be a sea of people shopping all sorts of things there. Mainly beauty products. I initially did not quite understand the concept of having multiple outlets of the same brand in one area but I think it is because the area is just too busy you may have passed the outlet you intended to visit to purchase your facial and cosmetics. When there are more in the same area, you don't have to worry having to make a u turn. Unless you are familiar with the area you wouldn't or can't go back to where you were from and all you can do is move forward. While at it maybe you can visit the Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral ."
Shop till you drop....,"Wow, have never seen so many shops all together where they sell all kind of cosmetics and beauty products. After all shopping we were beautified with the promise to get 20 years younger......"
a fun melting pot of establishments,"I love Myeongdong, too much that we went there almost every single day during our week's visit in Seoul. Every possible store that we were interested in we could find in Myeongdong. The place welcomes you as you step right out of the Metro exit. There are merchandises such as souvenirs, clothes, bags, other accessories and a wide array of street foods displayed on the stalls lined up in the midde of the streets. They are not the cheapest around Seoul though, but the most convenient in my opinion. One is not limited to the stalls on the streets, as there are quite a number of retail stores that are situated all across Myeongdong as well. You can even find good money changers in the area, and a tourist information office too. Definitely worth dropping by when in Seoul. "
Hooked to this Shopping Place,"There's not been a visit to Seoul without a visit to Myeongdong for me. It's like a ritual, a rite of passage. The first time I was amazed at the open energy of this place, the precariousness of the pretty females calling you inside shops for Cosmetics (Who needs so many cosmetics anyway!!).5 Year down the line, I can tell what is a Toner, Emulsion, Hand Cream, Body Lotion, Body Butter, Skin Cream, Body Mist, Foot Cream... Whew.. the list is endless. I can tell the ingredients too. I know Nature's Republic is gentle on Skin, Holika is mostly Korean skin friendly, Innisfree has an excellent range of product or where to buy the best and cheapest Snail Cream (No you did read it right, snail cream with gold particles is quite a rage here)Whatever well-behaved, repressed, archaic Korean air seems to be during the day, Myeongdong nights will definitely change your perception.Caution for Vegetarians: The air is filled with crisp/ roasted/ deep fried delicacies ranging from Octopus, Shrimps to Hot Dogs, so might feel your nostrils overwhelmed with confusing smells but you get used to it. You get the potato fritters too :)Currency exchange is available every block, usually rate is better than what you will get in Airport or your Hotel.Overall a must visit place :)"
Shop to your heart's content.,This really is a shopping place with lots of restaurants. Tourist information centre at the middle of Myeongdong will supply a map giving detail description of all the shops in the area . I am sure you will find something for yourself. 
"myeongdong the ""chinatown""","I enjoyed visiting myeongdong in 2008 and 2009. However, when I visited last week, I was hugely disappointed. Many fashion shops, and some food stalls have been squeezed out, replaced by skincare shops. They were repetitive in every lane and every turn, the same few brands!!Worst of all, the salesgirls are mainly interested in Chinese tourists, so if you do not look Chinese or do not speak Mandarin, or if you only want to buy less than 5 items, they basically ignore you, or serve you grudgingly.The few clothing shops are the same - poor service! One of the salesgirls shouted at me after I browsed a shop and did not buy! (apparently she felt that she wasted time following me around the shop, which I did not asked for).Fortunately some of the older eateries are still around, and maintained their standards, such as Myeongdong Gyoza, Tofu noodles and bibimbap.I would advise not spending more than 2 hours there. If you do get driven crazy by the crowd and/or the shoppers, do stroll into the cathedral (near Hotel Royal), a tranquil and lovely place."
Light shopper experience,"This place is busy and we came here twice during our trip to Korea. Full of eateries, street food, and shops especially cosmetics and skin care and I guess a must-see in Seoul. For a light shopper, I actually find the church and park nearby quite nice, and walked on the street further north to find the financial district a nice walk."
Nice place ,"I really love myeongdong . So many item in here and food too. In this area have cat cafe too , no regret. Its awesome place "
Awesome,Awesome place with so many different facial products to choose from at a reasonable cheap price. Definitely a must in Seoul. 
Don't go there if you can't speak Mandarin,"Similar to Mongkok in Hong Kong. If you can only speak English, it may be difficult to go around MD. The staff in the shops or Resturants except us speak mandarin. "
Shop shop shop,"Shoppers paradise. Super crowded but fun too. Felt like osaka japan's shopping scene with more better prices. Regardless of time, this place is full of energy"
This is the place for shopping ,"Crowded central area, probably the most famous shopping spot in Seoul. There are so many things to see you don't even know where you should look at! Big diversity of Korean cosmetic brands, small and trendy coffee shops, street food, gifts and even clothing and accessories for pets."
Young ladies' paradise,"We were in South Korea for 13 days. For the first 9 days, we traveled all the way along the east coast of South Korea visiting attractions in Namiseon Island, Seoraksan, Donghae, Gyeongju, all the way down to Busan and from Busan fly via Jejuair to Jeju. When we returned to Seoul after 3 nights in Jeju, we decided to explore Seoul on our own using the subway. It was very easy just like taking the MRT in Singapore. Beside visiting the ancient palaces, our aunties could not resist the temptation of frequenting all the shopping paradises in Seoul. And the one right on top of our list was Myeongdong, the `Orchard Road' in South Korea where you find latest cosmetic products at 30 to 40% cheaper than those in Singapore. Most of the aunties in my group are all obsessed with watching Korean dramas. The actresses are so young and beautiful and their skin rejuvenation secrets lies in plastic surgery and the cosmetic products they used. In fact, those aunties who did not purchase were also eager to collect the many free samples of skin products distributed at the front of the shops. There were many branches of cosmetic shops including Nature Republic, Lotte, Etude House, SkinCare, etc and you apparently see them everywhere. I don't fancy these ladies' products and instead walked around looking at the many makeshift stalls selling Korean delicacies. It was fun seeing the many creative way of selling food in this shopping belt. I was also surprised to see how evangelism was done in a creative way with gospel teachings written on banners and posters strapped on the body of the evangelist while he roamed around the shopping area as if he was carrying the `cross' on his back.I also noticed a banner with Chinese wordings hoisted around the shopping area to attract China tourists. Apparently with the influx of Chinese tourists into Korea, the retail businesses in Myeongdong were enjoying good times. Myeondong is modern and lustrous like the Orchard Road in Singapore as compared with Dongdamuen and Namdaemun. It is the shopping paradise of all our young ladies and aunties attracting them with all the skin products and cosmetics."
Ladies shopping paradise...,A place where ladies will not short find cosmetic stuff and clothes boutique. Night will have some temp pushcart stall
shop till you drop,"Crazy! Hyper shopping is the word. Lots of women's fashions in particular and cosmetic shops by the score. A lot of emphasis on face masks, which possibly explains the beautiful complexion of Koren women."
Shop til you drop!,"Busy as... well it's really busy. Be prepared for tourists, Koreans, and touts. You'll find excellent street food (especially in the evenings), tons of restaurants, clothes and cosmetics galore! "
Shopping!,"It's messy, crowded, hectic and big. It's easy to get lost, but you'll find something to buy anyway. Everything is jist so darn cute or very convincing conterfit luxury bags. You can haggle, eat, drink or wander. Good luck finding parking or just cab it. "
SHOPPING COSMETICS,Its the place that all Koreans and foreigners go to buy makeup and cosmetics especially masks. More than that you can find a lot of street food
Great area with crowded people,This is a market place with lots of local food taste. It is really crowded and it's more crowded at night. The lights and tall buildings will entertain you. 
Shoppers delight,"Get of the blue 5 line at Myeondong and exit number 6, turn left and go down the lane. You will find a multitude of shops in the lanes around the area. Explore inside some of the stores as they have shops inside on multiple levels. The place is hive of activity with people. Near the cathedral you will find stalls in the centre of the street selling all manner of goods, which at night time the stalls extend to over parts of the area. If you left at the theatre and cross Namdaemun-ro you will see Lotte town to your right. This is a giant department store the first four floors devoted to women's clothing alone. Worth the trip to see what Koreans are buying. "
Great food and culture,"This place is filled with the modern culture that is everywhere in Korea. The food is great, can'r go wrong anywhere here. Yes there is plenty of shopping but people watching is my favorite!"
Hell for boyfriends,"This shopping district is great for cosmetics and women's fashion, but better if you plan ahead. Do some research and find out which Korean cosmetic brands have the best reputation. One street is full of cosmetic shops - some cool, some boring. Choose carefully. Some of the prices are higher than in England, Australia or other Asian countries. You will not get a bargain if you buy just 1 or 2 things.Girls, leave your boyfriend behind. This is torture for men. All the streets look the same, it's a crazy labyrinth and it's hard to find a cafe where you can sit down. It's also very hard to find an English ATM. If you have small kids, don't bring them here. The cobbled streets will break any stroller and the crowds will bump into your kids."
Bright and bustling,"Definitely hustling and bustling! We found a noodle restaurant that was WONDERFUL and returned for a second meal. But, unlike other neon-lit districts in the world, this one actually goes to sleep relatively early, which surprised us. "
Cosmetic haven,For all the girls out there; this is cosmetic laden district! Simply love the shopping arcade that display so many variates! It is a big open air shopping so take your time to stroll there!.
Shop shop till you drop.,"Very exciting shopping area, Korean mask sold here. Mask Price it's decent here, lots of vendor/street food here. "
Popular tourist spot,"im not a bigfan of shopping districs, too many people here, so crowded. most popular tourist destination. Actually its little bit overly priced here compared to another area. "
Overcrowded,"This place is too stuffy. Overcrowded with so many local Koreans and Chinese people. Also price is not that cheap. Actually, it is bit expensive than you might expect."
Intense,Not my thing. Crowded noisy smelly and the same brand shops repeated over and over. Maybe more for the younger crowd.
Shopaholics' Heaven,"You can find everything here, i mean everything.From cosmetic, clothes, bags, food, cds, eletronics, lux brands...etcIf you love shopping, you have to go there!"
Not very cheap,you can find a handful of good brands as well as so many local shops. easy to get to via metro and very close to my ong dong cathedral
The best place I've went for shopping,"Loving the Myeondong streets so much. The things sold are various ranging from shirts, KPOP merchandise, shoes, beauty products which are always ON SALE lol"
Heaven,"My most favorite shops here are the cosmetics! They were really so cheap (compared in my country). I went crazy here and I swear that I will go back! The place is crowded but you won't mind it because you will go crazy shopping (if you enjoy shopping). If not, you could try different snacks in the middle. All are must try! :) "
Shopping in Seoul,"Travellers who are going to Seoul and intending to buy face masks and cosmetics, Myeong Dong offers the best bargains as they gives you more free gifts and samples. If you can speak korean, the sales personnels are able to speak mandarin and English."
A good start to discover seoul,"A good start for getting to know seoul if you are around the myeon dong area. The market spills over into the seoul plaza area wirh the lotte plaza and amazin lotte underground food hall, and further eastwards into the great mmyeong dong shopping district"
Good venue for Shopping Great place for food.,Easy access by subway Line 4 Myeongdong Station exit 8. Towards the end is subway Line 2 Eugiro-1(il)-ga. Many things to shop from fashion to cosmetics. Don't forget to look beyond ground floor shop and may fine great treasure. Visited SPAO for value for money young adult clothing WWW.SPAO.COM A must eat place at Myeongdong Kyoja for steamed mandu (dumpling) and extremly spicy kimchi http://www.mdkj.co.kr/en/ Sometimes this place could be long queue but disbursed quickly.
If you want to stay away from touristy crowd,"The only 2 things brought me here were the Nanta show theater & the Cathedral. For shopping, you can go to many other less touristy places like Apgujeong, Insadong, Sinsadong"
Must try the Korean skincare!,"This is a very touristy area but I really enjoyed walking around the streets here. There are many, many cosmetics stores and the sales staff are there to sell but the prices and quality of the goods are very reasonable and they will give a lot of free samples. We also found the shoes in ABC mart reasonably priced.This area is certainly worth a visit if you want to shop for Korean cosmetics/ skincare. There are the usual Zara, H&M, etc too.Despite this, the street food vendors that appear in the late afternoon sell delicious food and drinks which is certainly worth seeing and tasting - fresh fruit and juice, ice creams, pancakes, noodles....My husband an teenage son also enjoyed seeing this area."
The place to be for Seoul nightlife for tourists,"This is a fun place to be for tourists whether it be day or night but at night the lights of the street really stand out. It's totally happening - lots of food carts, stores, and people. This is a MUST-DO when you come to Seoul."
Great night life,"At night, this is really something to see. In the middle of all the cosmetic stores, there are vendors selling everything from chunks of watermelon to BBQ to tempura. "
Great Shopping Area,"Great of good foods , but pricing for the foods is not quite cheap . From bag to clothes to sock everywhere you can find here but is really tiring if you spend the whole day walking . Korean Dessert Bar is around the area, The snowflake is a must try over in Seoul if you ever saw. :) "
Great for the Cosmetic shopper,"Great for shopping, especially if your looking for cosmetics & other beauty products. Most shops you walk by gave free samples for just walking in & there are plenty of repeat shops down the streets. I now have a collection of different styled beaty mask. If not their for beauty the market is also good for some clothe shopping & food stands. "
Best shopping and street food area,Best place we visited during our Seoul trip. Great shopping and tasty street food. Lots of delicious restaurants too.
A trap not to missed,"This is like the place to be unless shopping is never on your list. Needless to say, fashion outlets, cosmetics, food from western to traditional, hotel stay are all lumped into this area. Bring enough cash and if you ran out, no worries since money changers are plentiful. Look out for the traditional kyoja that is close to 50 years."
A Fun way to end your days,"Compare to other similar places in other cities, MyeongDong vibes differently. Street food and shops like no others, varieties and culturally fun.We spent 3-4 hours just strolling the shops, and try bits of street food. Do try when you are in Seoul.. it won't be a disappointment.."
Shopping became fun!,Cool streets with funky stuff and affordable prices! I even purchased more clothes and really enjoy the moment! 
Exaggerated tourist information,Nothing special. Normal western style street. High prices for thing you can found in every shopping centre in Europe.
Don't miss out Myeongdong!,Don't miss out for fashion and foods! There are many fashion shop and hi-end boutique store. And world-class restaurant that you need to enjoy once in your lifetime.
A little overrated,The shops there aren't that interesting really. Mostly shops for beauty products like always. Not so much for clothing. What i did like was the street food cars that arrived around dinner time! They offer very good food and some even put on a show for you!
Lively but super crowded,"Very lively, but super crowded. Very popular with young Koreans, and also Chinese and Japanese tourists. Tip: If you just want to shop, come before noon on a weekend morning. For the first hour or two that shops are open, few people are around."
Can't decide!,"There were so many interesting shops and wholesale centres selling clothes, shoes, cosmetics, services and accessories! So many eateries and cute cafes! Be prepare to spend!! "
Shop till u drop,"literally. The place is a paradise for those who love to shop. It can also get very crowdy, so if you want to avoid the big crowds go before 4 pm or so but if you go later, you will get the streetfood. "
A must do in Seoul!,"Myeongdong is the neatest little area. The beauty brands have multiple locations in this location, so its easy to get turned around...but thank goodness for smartphones and gps! On our very first day in Seoul, my friend and I got dropped off in the morning. I highly recommend starting out here early if you want to avoid crowds! If you are into beauty products, this is your mecca!!! If you give a crack wh*re some crack, she's probably gonna go a bit crazy. I could have easily swept everything off the shelves and into my basket I was so excited! ! Sure they sell clothes and souvenirs there too...there's things for guys there. Also there's some decent restaurants if you get hungry while you shop. If you happen to find yourself in myeongdong in the evening..like after 5pm, the street food carts come out, and it becomes a completely different experience! If you're still not done shopping, head to the edge of myeongdong and go down into the subway entrance, you'll be met with a giant underground mall that connects you all the way to city station! Bags, clothes, shoes, souvenirs and snacks can all be found down there, away from the sun and the heat! Have fun!"
Too crowded,"Too crowded, and to me, it is like a China place, staff and visitors all speak Chinese, lack of local Korean charisma"
Lots of shopping,"Whatever your heart's desire, you can find it in Myeongdong. There are lots of clothing shops, cosmetic shops, restaurants, and cafes for when you get tired or need to refuel. I'd say it's more for girly-girls with cosmetic shops, but when when they're handing out samples it's fun even for tomboys!Easy to get to on public transportation (subway)."
night food market,"Great shopping area and especially for foodie at night with a lot of street food karts and seaoul is known for street eats, it is kind of a tourist trap, walk a bit around and you'll find some proper korean street food. however, its a must visit "
Pa-Pa-Paradise,"this is a heaven for a beauty junkie like me! The price is A LOT cheaper than in Indonesia, like half the price!! i warn you, it'd be better if you go to this place in your last days, so you wouldn't have any problem with your money"
Good for one day shopping of skincare and clothes under size UK 10,"We stayed in J Hill hotel which was in the right center of Myeongdong so we were able to see activities from morning till night. The streets become a huge night market in by 4pm, and are opened till 9pm - you are expected to bargain for the items. the shops themselves were never ending, repetitive outlets of the same brand.. every street will have an innisfree, missha etc .. there is only so much cosmetics and skincare one can buy, so i would rate myeongdong good for one day's shopping at most. if you are of a bigger size, forget about buying clothes here as their biggest size is a UK 10 in most shops."
"Pay slightly more for items, caps, socks, etc. nice ambience that's it.","50% of the items are facial shops, repeating sale of the same items. Food items are also mediocre in standard and really expensive. Good to go for just a sense of the place, famous Jimdak noodles as well as dumpling stall. Also be prepared to be shoved by locals and foreign travelers. "
Pay day paradise,This one is especially for the girls. Seouls shopping district has something for teens right up to moms and afterwards you can relax in one of the coffee shops while dad and the boys catch a movie. Easy to get to and lots of great places to eat.
Shopping,"Yes. You come here to shop. Then eat. Then shop some more. I would say go here after going to N Seoul Tower. I made a mistake of going here first, shop then go to N. Seoul Tower. I was way too tired for the walk.Just keep in mind that most of the souvenirs here can be found somewhere else (like Hongdae and Insadong) at a cheaper price."
Very fashionable ,For extreme shoppers. This a for people who love shopping. In addition there are many fantastic restaurants and street food!!! 
So many shops that my wife stayed here for hours,We were at Myeongdong couple of years ago and my wife loved it. So many things to see and buy and when we finished I had an empty wallet.
GREAT NIGHT MARKET,"We went at night and their were so many people shopping, enjoying eating street food. I just love it here! Too many shops to check and buy many stuff on the street. I will go back to this night market ,its so fun to taste all the different korean street food. Great night market! a must visit!"
Fashionable shopping area,Very fashionable and lot of modern and antique shops selling mainly fashion but also many restaurants and other shops as well. Lots of Koreans around shopping as well.
Evening fun!,"Love the street food and the vendors. Also, I've never seen so many cosmetic stores in one area! It would take me over a month to visit them all! Great vibe in the evenings! "
Skincare Heaven,"I have dubbed this place ""Skincare Heaven."" I took my sisters here when they visited from the States because I had read articles that this was the place to get free skincare and makeup samples. The articles suggested bringing an empty bag because you'd get so many just by walking through the stores.Well, those articles must be outdated. We got free sample but only after we purchased things. I guess I could have asked for free samples but I didn't feel right doing so if I wasn't going to buy anything. Nevertheless it was still something fun to do because there were so many skincare shops and each offer their own signature products."
A good place for shopping,Good for Shopping and Eating. spent all day here. good quality in the reasonable price. can ask the gift from the cosmetic shops.
Love it,I really liked this place. It has lots of chices. If you wanna just hang around you will enjoy it. If you are planning to buy korean products you will find there what you are looking for. I simply recommend you to enjou it there
First stop,"Whenever im in Seoul, this is the only place that I would have on top of my list for shopping and food!!"
free wifi,"the heaven for my wifey :D a lot of cosmetic shop and apparel from many brand. For me, I loves that is a full wifi. Yes!!except that a lot of food stall so we can try many food and beverage. I enjoy every single part of myongdong, interesting. not only for shopping but the other part is people and crowded on it. "
"Shopping, eating and cafes","The shopping was excellent! Some shops were more pushy in trying to get you into the shop, I opted to go where it was more laidback employees. I got to tend to my shopping list, many places to eat here and it was different every night. Do come here for people watching and for the street food! We stayed at a hotel nearby, and we came here every night, but we never got tired. Explore the nooks and crooks in Myeongdong away from the main streets, here are lots of skincare shops but less pushy people and lots of eateries. Dont forget to look up. Oh, and do visit the cat cafes and dog cafes, just ask to get some food, so you can feed them, instead of expecting them to entertain you. Myeondong - Excellent. I will be back!"
Good people watching. Good street food.,This place is very busy and interesting - good people watching and window shopping. There was also a lot of fun street food. It is a really nice place to walk around if you're out late.
Fun place to people-watch,"We were here during a torrential rainstorm and the MERS epidemic, and it was still pretty crowded - I can only imagine what this place is like on a typical sunny weekend! That said, it's a fun place to window (or actual) shop. My teenaged daughters really enjoyed buying adorable animal face masks and other cosmetic supplies while the rest of us loved the pearl tea, shaved snow, and other snacks we bought. It's a great place for people watching, since everyone there (even more than in the rest of Seoul) is young, fashionable, and ridiculously attractive."
Best Shopping Place,"Myeongdong is known for shopping, and its wide range of restaurants. You will find everything you want over there whether its in the streets or in small local shops. It's very busy yet its amazing. I love how every corner of the street has tiny shops. Whether you go left or right you'll find shops. In addition, the shops close late at night so you don't have to hurry and just take your time. "
shop!,"crowded but okay if u just want to visit the place. since i had limited time, wasnt really able to go to many stores. try the street food! yummy!"
Get ready to spend time browsing around,SO much to choose from. Lots of good buys. I ended up buying korean products like utensils and pants. Some are expensive because of its high quality.
Never boring streets,"Hundreds of shops. Restaurants, bars, dozens of big and small hotels, motels, banks at every corner. You can get anything in this shopping streets from Luxury items to newly introduced products."
Willpower required!,"Myeongdong shopping district, lovely, lively and clean! So many Etude House and Nature Republic stores I lost count. I guess the trip here would be more enjoyable if you didn't mind being dragged into stores by very friendly Koreans. Believe me, we told them no, but a few instances saw us having to pry our arms from their hands! Plenty of places to eat though, and not too pricey I thought. Definitely a not-so-thrifty shopper's paradise!Honestly, if you're looking for cheap, visit the Myeongdong underground shopping centre! No grabbing, just cheapness!"
"Great place to shop, gets very busy","Myeongdong has a lot of different clothing and cosmetics shops- basically all the kinds of cosmetics and young clothing shops in Korea you can find here! At times it's too busy, so it's best to go earlier at 10am to get some shopping done. If you like it busy then head there in the early evening."
Higher end common market ,"It definitely is alive with personality. Lots of music and people out on the streets trying to convince you to buy stuff. Rare couple people selling ""massages"" which seemed out of place. We didn't buy anything but did have lunch in the area, from which there are multiple good options. Another area to walk through but not a must see. "
Cosmetics Heaven,really cheap branded cosmetics; a lot of brands to choose from. they give free stuff for shoppers. Clothes from Forever 21 and Uniqlo is also cheap compared to other countries. 
"I love its bustling, lively feel","Plenty of shops (mostly cosmetics and fashion) and restaurants. You have lots and lots of choices. This place doesn't seem to sleep.Take your time to compare products, buy a piece of two and try before buying the actual."
"Food, Clothes, Make-up =>Shopping","This place is big and crowded; selling cheap to branded goods, street food to restaurant. All is here and all is well. A good place for shopping"
Stock up on cosmetics,"This place is crazy! Seoul is known for great shopping, especially Myeongdong, but what they are most famous for is their cosmetics. When in Myeongdong, buy. It helps to have a Korean friend guiding you, especially if you are not familiar with cosmetics. If you don't, or you don't want to buy anything, it is still a great place to walk around at night, get some street snacks, and people watch."
Shopping area,"You can find here almost everything, from local stores to international brands. Very crowded, and prices are not that attractive."
Must see in South Korea!!,"For shopaholics visiting South Korea, this is the place to go!! There are tons of shops here with a huge variety from skincare, food, fashion and so on!"
Must Go!,"Myeong Dong!!! My favorite place of all !!!!Shopping paradise for cosmetics and skincare!! There are lots of skincare stores such as The Face Shop, Holika, Skin79, Olive Young, Nature Republic etc. The area is made up by several streets combining to become one. There are stores selling upmarket Korean style fashion and also accessories which are of good quality. And also don't forget Hello Kitty Café and Dessert!! We didn't know of such a place until one day while walking through the streets we looked up and there it is!! It is near to the stores selling accessories. There are several food vendors along the streets selling authentic Korean snacks!! Also, we tried the restaurants along the streets which has Ginseng Chicken Soup, Dumpling soup and Seafood pancake!! Must try!! There Is also a Diaso store at one corner of the street selling pretty much Korean utensils. For those like us who want to buy gifts back for friends, there are many varieties to choose from. Do not have to worry for the restrooms. You can find them in those mini shopping malls or Starbucks or GongCha caffe, usually on the 2nd floor. Myeong Dong is also at the foothill of Seoul Tower. Do catch a visit there if you are at Myeong Dong."
Myeongdong,"Very busy, some of everything. Big tourist area. Lots of shopping, food, and there are many massage and pedicure places. There is a movie theater and a performing arts theater as well. Prices vary"
Must see,"This district is a super place for shopping cosmetics but you can find a lot of other shopping and restaurant in Myeongdong. Nice to go around for shopping and to see turist and korean people here. Very fanatics of beauty here, and it can be crowded at night but thats the fun of it."
An average street market.,"Like most things in Korea, this is overrated. Seriously. It's a few streets with vendors and whatnot, but it's certainly not a must see. Koreans hype it up, as they do with most things Korean, but in no way will you find Myeongdong as interesting as they do. "
Best place in Seoul,"This place is beauty heaven. Shop after shop of all the Korean cosmetic brands, all handing out free samples to lure you in. I loved coming here at night when all the lights were on, it's such an exciting atmosphere. "
Best shopping in Seoul,"I would say Myeongdong is the best shopping area in Seoul. Many cosmetics shops, clothing shops and restaurants. A Must visit when you are in Seoul"
Heaven for Shopaholics!,"I recommend that you download a map of Myeongdong Shopping District or find a Tourist Information Area (the one I saw was in front of Myeongdong Theater) when you arrive at Myeongdong and ask for a Map before shopping. It'll be sooooo much easier for you to plan your shopping route, buy all the things you want and still have time for street foods around Myeongdong!"
Shopping cosmetics,I love shopping cosmetics in myeongdong.. They gave me a lot of samples of cosmetics in there.. And you can find many brands of korean cosmetics in there.. I want to go to myeongdong againn.. 
Shops galore,"Shopping areas are always great places to check out the local vibe, be it in fashion or food.Myeongdong offers streets lined with fashion shops, in which you can buy anything from Gucci to Adidas, usually at 'sale' prices. Whether these really are bargains, you have to decide by shopping around, but if you can't find what you're looking for in one shop you're sure to find it just a little way down the street.Add in the vast array of food stalls set up in the street, where you can get a cup full of fresh fruit in summer, or a hot dish of teokpokki in winter. Vendors will adorn their stalls with all kinds of 'come-hither' decorations and lights, and back it up with interesting takes on street food - witness the pancake stuffed with nutella, banana, salad and honey-butter squid...So, if you're after clothes, decor or food, Myeongdong is almost sure to have it."
"Wow, energy abounds here","Get to Myeongdong Cathedral as the sun sets and watch the magic. Great shopping especially for young adults. The music, lights and street food make this a safe magical place to hang out in the early evening. The teenage kids loved this night. The food we had here was excellent. The family of 5 fed on less than $A80. "
Non Stop Shopping,"Never ending shopping in Myeongdong. However, too many shops and can't decide which shop to enter. Anyway, will definitely revisit Myeongdong."
Worth a look,plenty of shops and restaurants. Big on skin care and cosmetics. At night so many awesome food stalls
Favorite place to shop in seoul,I love shopping in myeongdong because they have a lot of Stores that I love and an familiar with the style and sizes. The forever 21 is huge and so nice! As well as H&M and ZARA. The lotte young mall also just opened an American eagle and even though over priced it's nice to have some options! The street food here is also wonderful!
The best shopping place in Seoul,"This place is a must if you are in Seoul. The place is packed with shops and restaurants. You can chill the whole day there. Many restaurants from street food, fast food to nice dinning. Overall, great place and must visit if you are in Seoul."
Must see!,lots of stores dedicated to facial care and cosmetics. also lots of familiar brands like Uniqlo etc. Fabulous street food while shopping! a definite must see if you're in seoul! 
Shopping and Cosmetics on Steroids,"One day roaming the streets of the Myeongdong is not enough. We came back 2 more times to eat and shop. We must have stopped in every skincare store in the Myeongdong. We cruised through Lotte Duty Free store - especially the cosmetics/skincare floor. It was jammed pack full of tourists, especially Chinese tourists from China! They knew a good deal! They were queued at the most popular Korean brands, Amore Pacific and Sulwhasoo. The Shinsegae department store is a fun place to walk through, reminds me of a Neiman or Saks. The real must see in the Myeongdong is Lotte Duty free cosmetics/skincare floor and all the skincare stores lining the streets! We can't forget the cute clothing stores either!We also had some awesome street food and restaurant meals."
Shopping paradise or ladies,"Myeongdong in Seoul has thousands of shops for ladies mainly for cosmestics. Open until late 9 or 10 pm and close to Loette department store.Open street market food are available. Very Asian style of shopping experience. Plus many Korean branded lady cosmestics, like shopping in a big open air supermarket for cosmestics."
Nice Place,"Its a great place to buy and to try new things Koreans Restaurants, clothes , beauty things, or if you only want to walk and see people . It is a beautiful place with great oportunities to see korans culture. "
Some of the best shopping I have done in my life,"This district is a super place for shopping, It's really vibrant and there are so many shops, you can find pretty much any piece of clothing you want. For books I would go to the big kyobo bookshop two subway stations further."
Eat and Shop,If you love to explore street food and shop at the same time then Myeongdong is the place to go. It gets crowded at night but thats the fun of it. You can find lots of delicious street food here.
Taking retail to a whole new level.,This area is a series of pedestrian streets jammed full of shops and restaurants but most of all a woman's delight with tons of cosmetic shops. My wife was in heaven but my wallet was not.
Top-Location for those who love to shop,"Excellent places with a lot of shops, shopping malls, good restaurants and even some vibe. Whether to stich to stree vendoors or posh high street brands, you might find everything - and best of it, there will always be a good discount or a high quality add on. I got a decent bell after buying 2 shorts and even when buying cheap socks at a street seller you instantly will get a discount. A allover in Seoul the stuff is excellent in English."
Variety,This place is a one stop shop. There are plenty of stores to window shop or wander in. But you will notice there are plenty of cosmetic and beauty care shops too. But still the vareity of shops is a good draw. Eateries and dining options are plenty. 
"If you like shopping, it's perfect","It was alright-if you are spending more than a few days/weeks in Korea, it might be worth the stop just for the street food. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of shopping. I prefer to do more off-the-beaten-path, historical type things on my visits to foreign countries, but that doesn't mean that Myeongdong isn't for you! If you want to stop by, take the subway and only spend an hour here for lunch/dinner/snack, and make sure to go on a weekend or later in the afternoon/night to really experience the street food."
Shopping paradise,"Always crowded but loads stuffs to shop. This place is a must visit place for tourists .Restaurants, coffee shops and shopping stuffs are in abundance here.. I like the vibe of this place "
good for shopaholic!,"I never get enough for this place! I think Myeongdong is one of 'heaven' in Seoul. I always go to this place everytime I visit Seoul. Not only well-known brands are here, you can also find some unique accessories or sth else if you explore the aisles"
Convenient shopping district in Seoul,Plenty of popular Korean brands in this shopping district. You can haggle in some shops. Some will even give you freebies if you purchase a lot of items from them. 
"Socks Socks Socks ! Seoul, South Korea","Awesome shopping ! Love Socks visit here. Great place to visit, Enjoy Korea! An all around great place to visit. Make sure you visit the SeoulSocks shop its really great shop."
Cosmetic heaven,"This is the place you want to go for shopping! Especially for cosmetics! There are cosmetic stores every five meters and there are people on the street trying to get you in by giving you a handful of free testers. The cosmetics in Korea are very cheap compared to Europe and the quality is outstanding, don't be afraid to try some crazy things like snail masks etc either, those are the good stuff for real. Remember to ask for samples when you are paying, they will give you another handful of samples for free and you might turn up finding real gems. Lots of food joints, clothing stores and high end stores in this are as well. Don't bother shopping anywhere else, you got it all in here.TIP: at the metro stations you can rent a locker for a small price, if you are planning for a shopping spree like we did you might want to rent a locker and when it just gets too heavy to carry, bring them in the locker and continue. Be aware tho that the problem of carrying those heavy bags still waits you after the haul. ;)"
Great place for cosmetic and food,Large crowds could be seen once you get out from subway. There are many people looking for cheap cosmetic in Myeongdong as it sell plenty of popular brands in Asia. There is also a supermarket nearby selling assorted Korean food and snacks. Price is reasonable.
Great shopping place for cosmetics,"After Mongolia tour, we are in urgent need of face and body lotion to quench the dryness. Luckily our hotel, The Grand Hotel is located in Myeongdong, we shopped around and got very good deals what are we looking for. Due to MERS outbreak, a lot of shops have huge discounts and gave us a lot of free samples which are perfect for travel."
Shop Till You Drop,Our hotel was in Myeongdong and every night we went shopping and food tripping there. We were lucky that night market starts early. Got some nice stuffs for reasonable prices.
"If you have limited time, go to Insadong","Potentially the most touristy spot in all of Seoul. Insadong is equally touristy, but offers a marginally more authentic Korean experience."
many things to shop and price is reasonable,there are many things to buy and the price is reasonable. there are many many different kinds of mask you could find there and some of them are free to try. the shop sales are very friendly and helpful. a nice shopping there.
Peaceful for shoppers...,Myeongdong is peaceful for shoppers and there are a lot of establishments to choose for your shopping needs. Truly a mecca of tourists and bargain hunters.
Myeongdong or Insadong which one to go to,"If you have time go to both, but if you are short on time then my preference would be for Insadong. If my daughter was with me I'm sure she would prefer Myeongdong for shopping!"
Shopper's paradise,"This is one of the most bustling places in Seoul - but it has a one mode theme: shops, shops, and shops ... from bargain street vendors to main stream retail. If this is your thing then you are going to have lots of fun. Personally, I found it a little overpowering after a while. If you look up to the second stories of the buildings you will see some cafes - that's a good place to retreat to when you need a break."
Shopping galore,"The streets are lined with clothes , bags and most of all things to make one beautiful.. Different arrays for skin tones, nail polish,hair color, lipsticks...you name it - Myeondong got it all!"
City bustle ,"Stayed at the Nine Tree Hotel in Myeongdong. On the south side of the area, and only a 15 minute walk to the Mount Namsam cable car. Every other shop was a beauty store. So much choice. Found a tiny supermarket opposite the hotel that had everything we needed. There's also a night market near the area. Bargains after bargains ! Could get lost if you weren't paying attention with all the night stalls ! "
i'm broke,"if you love shopping , this is the best place for you they have cosmetics,clothes, local to famous brand such as hnm zara"
Lots and lots of shop,"They sell mostly fashions and cosmetics. You can get cosmetics with a good price here, plus they will give you free samples. Each brand has some stores in this area and the promotion/discount in each shop can vary.This area also have money changer with good rates."
endless shopping :)),Our hotel is located in rhe heart of myeongdong and i would say that it's a good choice since as a tourist i like going out at night shopping . There are lots of clothing stores like h&m and forever 21 and it's sale season when we went to these stores. Also cosmetics stores are found all over myeongdong and always give free stuffs :) visit myeongdong or better yet find a hotel there because you will never get tired of shopping :)
A Must Visit in Seoul for Your Shopping Fix,"This is a must to visit for anyone visiting Seoul. This is a shopping district than spans several blocks. Best time is late afternoon when all the food stalls are out and the you are truly in amongst the hustle and bustle of everything. There is something here for everyone; mini shopping malls, food stalls and restaurants catering for all taste and budgets, shops selling anything you can think of, hair salons, massage parlours, money changers and street stalls selling f course Korean socks. Walking distance you will also fine the big departments stores, Lotte and Shinsegae. Expect large crowds and at least a couple of hours, but visit."
Tips for shopping,"I was walking around with a shopping list given by my mum. She has listed the price of each item which can be bought online for a certain price. My job of course was to find the item and get it at a lower price. So from this I learnt that most sales staff can give you 20% discount even though there is no other promotion. Just ask for it and be firm, otherwise walk away because there are probably 4 of the same shop in the area."
Great for cosmetic and skin care shopping,This place is so busy with cosmetic and skin care shops. Be prepared to walk down the street and have face masks and fans offered to you but once you take one they will usher you into their store to sell you something. It's ok to have a look around but don't feel pressured to buy something because they can be full on. Some shop keepers are a little pushy while others will give you space. Some will follow you and as soon as your eyes have stopped on a product for more than 5 seconds they will try to sell it to you. Most are very helpful.
Shopping paradise ,"If you plan to buy cosmetics , myeongdong has all the different brands in one street. The retailers there give out many free samples. If you don't speak korean , they have korean staff who speaks English and china staff there to serve you. Lots of food there as well!"
Nothing special,"It's like Gangnam of the north of the river. It's definitely good for shopping if you want... let's see... clothes, shoes, face masks and street food. Don't bother for souvenirs, technology or quirky novelty."
shopping paradise but too crowded,"if you like to shop, here is the best place for you, but really crowded. many foreigner and korean are there, and a lots of different cosmetic shops are there, you can find everything you need in myeongdong"
"If you enjoy shopping, this spot is for you","Myeong dong shopping area is covered in street vendors and an unimaginable number of shops, foreign and domestic. Covering several city blocks and tucked just behind a main road the district cannot be seen while driving. It is like a diamond in the ruff, a secret garden. If you enjoy shopping, this spot is for you. After dark is truly when the magic happens with blindingly bright lights and people flooding the narrow streets and inside shops. There are a plethora of beauty supply stores in the area and they hand out free facial rejuvenating masks to compete with one another. There are several places to relax in air conditioned spaces and restaurants galore. However, the food vendors in the streets are the best tastes of the area."
family holiday,"a good place to shop and eat street food. famous brand like hnm, zara, uniqlo & forever21. we can also found pizza hut, kfc, california pizza near by."
Shop till you Drop,"If Paris is Europe's shopping district , well for me I think Korea is Asia'a best shopping district. If you're into shopping Myeongdong is the Place to be! A lot of stores (local and famous retail brands) , but I would really suggest to buy Korean brand specially clothes!!! They are so cheap plus the fact that they are also trendy. You will see a lot of Cosmetic shop in every corner . When you go to Myeongdong make sure that you prepare your feet to long walks , bring a huge bag to keep the items you shopped . Piece of Advice Korean retailers are not into really giving big discounts and sometimes it's so hard to persuade them to give you lower price! "
Shopping lover's paradise,"The first time we went to Myeongdong, we were floored at the volume of people that were there and the amount of vendors and shops. You can't go through all of it in one day, so since its near our uotel, we've kind of made it our nightly ritual to visit a part of Myeongdong we haven't been to yet, and we always find something new (we're in Seoul for 8 days so that's a lot of time to look around, haha).Beware of the salespeople always trying to hand you things like free samples and fliers. One salesperson even kind of followed us to try to get us to go into the store, but you just have to be firm and say no.Overall, I love this place! Would recommend to anyone who wants to get a taste of Seoul."
"Lotsa Sales, Lotsa Repeat too","Like: how easy to come here and how many types of food, clothes, headwear to facial stuffs you can get here. Most of the beauty shops here do sales and willingly give a lot a lot of freebies, the more you buy, the more freebies you'll getDislike: Beware of people pushing around. Street food too very over price for a stick of potato cost 3USD, better go for a meal in nearby restaurant. Too much of shops that are the same. Too repetitive"
"Hopefully, I will be back..",If shopping is your thing. Myeongdong is the place.Shop till you drop. I felt safe here. Lots of police in the area.
Shopping Place...,"Unless you are really into shopping, I don't find this place is interesting. Insa-song is much more interesting in my opinion. If you don't have a lot of time in Seoul, you can skip Myeongdong."
Shop till Exhausted,"Myeongdong, big place, many malls, stores, stalls, underground shopping. Endless of it. Ok we start from Lotte Department Store. Many many stores inside and I always love the basement where the foodcourt and foodstalls abundant. Trying endless food, cake, chocolate, bread, candy, dumpling and eating many many, drinking many coffee and sherbet. A very heaven to me, there is a food stalls sell various fishes and they taste SOOO great. The supermarket also got so much stuffs in side including kimchi, bimbimbap sauce and strawberries and any other thing. Shop branded with price and tax refund. Ok out from Lotte we go to Underground Shopping with Kpop atributs and cheap clothes and foot wear, go up to many stores of cosmetics and brand like H&M, Zara etc and in the afternoon the food stall open with more interesting Korean street food. Korean strawberry is very nice, about 5000-7000W per package. And take those lanes here and there, there and here till your feet shut you down, if you want to stay here they got Ibis Myeongdong in 3minutes walk. If you are into cheaper option, head to the Underground Shopping they have a lot of stuff as well. Coming back? Oh pretty much definitely.."
do you like make up?,"i had heard of Myeongdong and not being a make up person, i didn't really care. But in the first twenty minutes, i was hooked, i came home with so much make up and skincare. Not only from spending but from the free samples you receive with every purchase, terrific steal."
STREET SHOPPING,the street is very lively and vibrant. a lot of people busy buying and eating some street foods. cheaper shopping is available every corner and lot also of restaurant. nice place and safe also
Shopping heaven,"Life in Korea is totally different. Shopping is a must when coming to these part of town. I believe that tourist even from China and Japan spend their time in these areas. After reviewing this place, I figure out that there was a duty free zone which enlighten the minds of shoppers for a cheaper bargain. So why not shop till you drop to get the best goods in town."
Best Place to Shop in Korea,"Its a galore in here! With beauty products costing about half the price you pay in Singapore, you have to come here! From Laneige to Tony Moly, you could get these famous Korean brands here. Its a pretty big shopping area for beauty products and clothes(although more clothes choices at Dong Dae Mun), hence prepare to spend more than 3 hours here if you are a shopaholic.A little tip for tourists, if you wish to get immediate tax refund, purchase your beauty products at Lotte Duty Free, just flash your passport and you get the tax-free price."
"Love the shopping, vibrant place!",A lot of food and shopping here! Lots of tourists frequent this place. Lotte department is nearby and the prices of some brands are so much cheaper compared to my own country. Lots of facial products which are so cheap!
Shopping,So many shops there we had to go twice. The shopping is endless. The prices are pretty low and affordable. There are many many things you can get there.
Lots of beauty product shops!,"This is a fairly small area and there are many opportunities to earn ""free"" products as long as you are willing to go into their stores. The workers are amazing with their ability to speak English, Chinese, and Japanese. We really enjoyed The Art Box where we found all kinds of cute products. We also bought some products from Nature Republic."
Crazy place but loved it!,"So much going on and to see. Evening time the street food stalls come out so you can try all the local treats for 1000-3000won. So many beauty shops selling makeup and cosmetics- they entice you with freebies then expect you to come into the shop and look around. You don't have to buy anything which is good, so get your freebie, look around and then leave!"
one stop destination to shop until you drop,"has many beauty flagship stores, where Hello Kitty cafe, cat and dog cafe is loacted. At night watch the streets transform with popular street food. "
So Much Shopping,I can't believe there are so many store in such as little area. There are also great restaurants. Definitely should check this place out
Shop and shop some more!,"Plenty of shops all over the place, all the Korean cosmetic brands can be found here and they always give you samples when you buy or if you enter the shop. After a while, you see many duplicates of the same brands. There is plenty of street food to buy along the way and many nice restaurants or cafes to eat and rest your legs. One can find everything here!"
very lively,"our hotel was right next to it; and so we landed in myeongdong on our first evening itself. this is an extremely lively place and the main attraction is street food and street shopping. there are all kinds of street foods, from ice creams, waffles, to korea food, fruit juice ; the variety is endless. options for vegetarians were limited but there were some. there was all kind of street shopping including fakes. definitely one of the highlights of our seoul trip; we went there 4-5 times and had dinner thrice"
Shopping street in Seoul,"Although there is alot of shops around this area, most of them are duplicate. Within a short distance you will see the same shop especially cosmetics. They will have staff outside the shop holding the masks trying to entice you. However, don't be mistaken. It's not free. The atmosphere here is what attract tourists. Definitely still a place to visit when in Seoul. "
ssshhhoooopppiiinng!!,"Looking for a place in Seoul with great bargain sale? Then this place is definitely what you are looking for. From trendy outfits, to cosmetics and accessories..name it, they have all of it. Plus you can get to try their yummy street foods while roaming around the vicinity. :)"
Once you shop... you can't stop,"At every corner, there was a crowd and shops (mostly selling cosmetics) dotted all over the area - a literal shopper’s paradise. We exited out Exit 7 of the Myeongdong subway station, the entrance to the shopping heaven!The layout of Myeongdong is interesting. Instead of being housed within a shopping mall complex, almost all shops (e.g. H&M, Etude House, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Shara Shara, Tony Moly, Atrium etc...) were stand alone buildings scattered around the neighborhood. If you are looking for cosmetics, than Myeongdong would be one place you cannot miss with all the cosmetic shops being close to each other and having more than one branch within the same area (there were probably 2-3 stores of each brand just in the Myeongdong area!!).Language-wise, it was not so bad as the sales people (mostly ladies) were proficient in Mandarin. Freebies and service wise, as there are probably 2-3 stores of each brand in the area, so it might be good to walk more around the area as each branch staff’s generosity and politeness differs. There were some shops where when we entered, were ignored because there were too many people (in the shop)and even when we asked questions about a certain product, there were some sales persons who were impatient and did not provide much help/""hardselling” while there were other who were warm and friendly as they tried to sell their wares."
Skin-care heaven,"I've been using Korean skin-care for a couple of years now, because it's very high quality and very reasonably priced.I went nuts in the stores and Myeong-dong and spent more that I intended. I don't care. I now have a years' supply of skincare.Recommended +++."
Shop shop and shoo,"This place is totally for shopping. Most of the well known departmental stores such as H&M, Uniqloo etc are here. All of the skin care shops you would like to have in Korea could be found here. Many eateries here and street food to enjoy too."
Trendy area for cosmetic & clothing shopping,"It's a trendy place to shop for cosmetic & clothing items as well as accessories (hats, scarves, etc). In recent times, these area have salesperson who can speak Mandarin (and some who can speak basic English). There are coffee shops, restaurants and street food stalls when it comes to eating. This place is for you if your itinerary includes clothing & cosmetic shopping at trendy boutiques and stores."
shopping lovers,"good place for shopping lovers, atmosphere is really breathtaking , lot of people roam around this market which adds more charm."
Excellent Shopping Area!,"If you want to do money exchange, this is the best place you can find the best exchange rate. Lots & lots of nice boutiques and cosmetic shops; choices of snacks in late afternoon till night."
My wife had a great time shopping here!,"Pretty fun place to people watch, eat, and do a lot of cosmetic shopping. During the evenings there food and inexpensive clothing vendors arrive, filling up the central areas. Be sure pay attention around you, cars and scooters are allowed to drive on the street.All the cosmetic workers speak very good Mandarin and some English."
Skincare & cosmetics mecca!,If you want make up or any kind of skincare products this is the place to shop. Many shops have sales girls outside of them luring you in with samples of skincare. Most is of good quality and same with the make up. There are also many trendy Korean restaurants & coffee shops. In the evening street food stalls open up as well and they're all fun to try. Enjoy the buzz.
Food! Cosmetics! Clothes!,I honestly thought that it would be cheaper here in Myeondong but it wasn't it was just like the other shops but the food where great! 
shop shop shop,"Surprisingly for such a busy well known tourist attraction, the stores around here for shopping close at around 10pm. There's so much people in each store and in every cosmetic store everything is mainly sold to cater to the many Chinese tourist that come to visit the city, which only buy in bulk and nothing else. I personally do not like the foreign crowd this area attracts and find it too busy to enjoy the shopping. I would definitely recommend going to the less busy areas to meet your shopping needs as most Korean cosmetic brands can be found everywhere. They do tend to hand out more samples while walking the streets but tend to find that they hesitate on whom they give it to. Worth checking out but not the best for finding deals and bargains unless you love to fight the crowds! "
WANT MORE!,"i loved the fact that it had coffee shops, beauty stores, clothing stores and accessory shops scattered all over the place. the prices are friendly for any kind of budget. i'll definitely be back!"
"Exciting, Fancy, Alive","So many shops on the street as well as packed of people. Interesting unusual items, alive atmosphere made me very exciting."
Shopping heaven,"Please do your homework before coming here. Download all the related discount coupon. I downloaded discount coupon from visit korea website as well as a Japanese website (I read a little Japanese). Some salespersons can speak English. The saleslady from Laneige left me with the deepest impression. She speaks good English, she is very friendly and helpful. Happy shopping there"
Great shopping district,Myeongdong has every shop you could want (some even have two or three stores in the one area). Visit in the afternoon or evening and try the many food stalls that line the roads.
Shopping Center of My kdrama dreams!,"We eventually made our way to shopping heaven known as Myeongdong. This is the area everyone gawks about on television and traveling magazines. You’ll find your discount street vendors and luxury brands all in the same district. Plan to stick together because you will get lost. There’s no “I’m standing right near The Face Shoppe” because everywhere you turn there’s the same shop. There are different stores for different taste. Here is where you can get all the top Korean beauty care products you can dream of. Trust me, I loaded up. You can never look too young! Oh, and beware of the cute elderly Asian woman offering massages – she’ll kick you if you say no and then pat your shoulder to play it off -- and yes, it kind of hurt."
Cosmetics Shopping,Shopping but mainly Korean brand cosmetics which are cheaper than back home and with a greater range of products. All sales assistants speaks Mandarin to cater to the mainland chinese shoppers. Lots of places to snack and there wil be some street foods at night.
Disappointing shopping area - much hyped,This one turned out to be the only disappointment during our Seoul visit.... much hyped but just as expensive and just like any other shopping area in Seoul
shopping for cosmetic product,best place for shopping. get your cosmetic product for a cheap price. Free gift for purchase above $50. Get the face mask 20 pieces for $10. Best place to go. dont forget the sulbing cafe korwan dessert cafe. Check it out...
Yummy delicious local food and shopping paradise,good shopping location and lots of local delicious food.. must try. a place that you can't miss that 
"Cheap, lots of options","You can get most of your cosmetics and skin care here, like a heaven to ladies! However, most of the people here speak Chinese (due to large number of Chinese tourists) you actually don't feel like you are in Seoul."
nightlife,Lots of cosmetics shop.Good place to shop but dont forget to bargainDont forget to visit the Cat Cafe! They have over 40 fluffy cats there
Shopping ,Good place for shopping with couples friends family.if u want discount goods u need come in February is better more than another month.
Shop shop,"Shop shop shop till you drop, nice shopping area, many shops to look at and visit. There are many restaurants around as well."
Greeat buys,Love this place. You have plenty good buys. Ready your money. They offer wide range of great buys to bring home. And the price is great. No need to huggle. They also had lots of food sellers along the street. You cannot get hungry. My children enjoyed their trip to Myeongdong. They want to go back again and again
Endless shopping,"Endless rows of cosmetic shopping where the shop assistants would throw in free samples when purchasing items. However, for every cosmetic brand, there are identical shops in the area (e.g., there were a couple of 'Nature Republic' shops within that area).The street food along Myeongdong offers affordable quick bites to take a break away from shopping."
"If you are not a fan of crowds, don't go there.","Shops, restaurants, shops, restaurants. Nothing else. Nothing to do if you don't want to spend your money. Other shopping places are more interesting."
Shopping and Street Food,"I am not a fan of shopping in my travels but if you like it, you should go there to find brands and shops all around. You can also try BIBIMBAP (Korean style rice), hot fresh juices, street food, teahouses, which are more Korean. Enjoy!"
Tons of Cosmetic Shops,"As another reviewer said, there are a ton of Korean cosmetic shops here! I saw probably 2 or 3 shops for each brand, and I think they outnumbered all the other kinds of shops combined. So, if you're looking to stock up on some fantastic Korea beauty products for half of what they would cost to order them online, this is the place for you! They also lure you into the stores with free samples, although you don't have to buy anything.There are other kinds of shops if you want to take a look around, but nothing special. Mostly over-priced clothes and souvenir shops. My boyfriend did get a very amusing hat here though...."
Mad Shopping area!!!,LOL...shopping heaven...street food too!!...go in the evenings...better...lights and dazzle!!...plenty of food choices...be ready for crowds...a lot here....do be careful about pick pocket crime here...
Place among places for shopping!,"There's so many things to do in this amazing place. If you are a shop-a-holic, then this place is for you! Whatever you are looking for, dress, shoes, accessories, make-ups, anything. Name it. You can find in this place! And if you're tired shopping, you can stop by in some restaurants and try their specialty food."
Must visit,"There's so many things to do and see in this place! Tons of restaurants and street food vendors. Place is so lively. I think this is a must to experience Seoul. You'll see lots of tourists, but also a lot of Koreans doing their shopping too. Visit the Uniqlo building, I think it's one of the biggest. I can visit this place every night!"
So much shopping!!,"Despite the heavy crowds, strolling through Myeongdong was an amazing shopping experience. There were a ton of stores, and all the shopping assistants were doing their very best to entice shoppers inside. All the stores were very clean and nice, and many stores gave out free samples for products as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful. All in all, a very pleasant shopping experience."
Shoppers destination,"If you love shopping then go here. There are department stores, designer stores, foreign brands and of course the local stores. There is a great variety. Lining these streets are a large number of Korean cosmetic brands with staff enticing you to buy their products. Not only can you shop till you drop but enjoy fantastic restaurants, cafes and the nearby movie theatres. It's a great place to stop at on your trip to Seoul and in walking distance to hotels and Namsan mountain. If you're not staying in Myeongdong, you can easily reach here through the local transport.I highly recommend dropping by here but be warned it gets busy."
Times square of S. Korea,"There was really good shopping here. Once in the stores they are nice and clean, but the staff not super friendly. It reminded me a lot of NYC... a little dirty on the streets at night and loud with shop workers trying to hand you flyers all the time. What was fun was all the street vendors with interesting foods available. Plus where else can you go and hear K Pop playing? We went to some good K pop stores for my daughter. So many skin care stores. Lots of food places, we ate a local places. A neat Cat Café we wanted to try but didn't have time for. A McDonalds there sells sandwiches with shrimp :) We stopped at a French pastry shop most days. Very inexpensive (less than $2) and very good. Really crowded with tourists, but go off a few streets to get away from it. Really close to the stream which is especially pretty at dusk. I found S. K. really affordable. "
Shopping Heaven,"Many shops on beauty products, cafes.. Almost every corner of the streets selling the same thing but of different price. Street foods too, but limited varieties"
Great shopping!,"If you do not live in the area, it is worth 2 days there to complete the shopping. If you buy enough, like more than 100 US, the shops will provide you with tax return vouchers. The street food is very tasty, and clean. "
Something for everyone,"Easily the must do for the shoppaholics like myself and partner. Spent hours purchasing cosmetics and eating street food. The area is always bustling with people, shops open slightly later and there is a good mix of brands and local designs. Some of the better exchange rates are available here as well if you're looking to get some Korean won."
crowded,Busy and crowded on weekends and sooooo loud and fun. There is a big Nature Republic shop near metro station (with vegetation on walls) top floor has a big kpop shop.
One day will never enough,"this is one of my favorite place. full of shopping store from make up, appareal, parfume to food stall, almost everything you looking for is in here.Once you reach Myeongdong, don't missed the ""egg cake"", the taste is a little bit unique yet tasty. beside that, don't forget ""Odeng"", skewer fish cake with spicy soup, and there is many more street food you could try in Myeongdong.since this place so huge, one day will never be enough to exploring this shopping area."
great,"Big, clean, lots of shops to shop around. Lots of choices, Really liked it. Don't know what else to say. It really worth a stop."
Great for shoppers,"Many many shops selling different products, with many restaurants and most importantly, currency exchange shops offering good rates."
This is really shopping heaven,"Looking for skincare & make-up? Myeongdong has it all! Make sure you are on ur best pair of walking shoes, cause there is plenty to see, eat and shop! If you travel to Seoul and nvr visited Myeongdong, you did not really experience Seoul. If you want to hunt for cheap buy? Suggest to check out Lotte Department Store, lvl 9 -11 are the duty free shops, which prices are much cheaper compared to shop lots outside. But be prepare to Q, tourist groups kinda pack the place. "
have a budget,or you will find too much to buy! great viewing and interesting crowds make even a non-buying trip worth the time
shop till you drop,"Apart from the huge variety of shops selling all kinds of stuff, if you are catholic, you should visit the Myeondong Cathedral at the end of the street. We were there on a Saturday and there were 4 weddings going on one after the other, so it was clockwork precision with the choir going as well. What was fascinating was the little booths in the courtyard for guests for each wedding group to put in their gifts. Everyone queued so quietly. It was also very nice to see the mix of traditional grand Korean dressing amidst the modern attire of the guests. At the end of the mass, the wedded couple would bow to each side of the pew to thank the guests. "
Over crowded by tourist.,"Foreigner who cant verse in Korean, and need enquiry, look for person wearing red shirt and red hats with red ""apron"" filled with maps, they can speak mandarin and english. I personally like crowded place but not this one. The salesperson from those shops are just way to hardsell. Due to massive foreigner came here to restock cosmetic, most of them learn foreign language too, especially mandarin. My friend and I was just asking for the price and decided to buy 2 or 4 pieces of mask, in the end we got pulled by one of the salesperson roaming all over the store, introduce this and that, asking to buy this and that. The things is not pricey but they packed in bulk, and we are not in financially position to buy bulks items. Therefore, I would recommend, for young traveller, or low budget traveller like me, try to refrain from their sweet talk, or their hardsell tactic. Just walk off. Nothing to lose then. If you want to buy cosmetic from those ""famous store"", just go lotte mart in seoul station, you can get a piece of mind. (Tips: those shop in myeongdong told me promotion item cannot tax refund, but the same shop lotte mart, they offer tax refund no matter it's promotional item or not, and the branch is lotte mart offer better promotion)"
Convenient...,"Food and shopping,everything in walking distance. However, goods are comparable expensive at this area. "
Exciting busy atmosphere with many shops to choose from,"If you are the type of person that likes busy hectic places then Myeongdong is for you. It's usually quiet in the morning but the whole place livens up around mid afternoon and peaks at night. You will find all sorts of clothing outlets including local and foreign, plenty of cosmetic stores and authentic Korean restaurants for food lovers. If you're more of the adventurous type then why not try the street food? There's plenty to choose from. Be Warned those of you not from the bigger cities might find the place intimidating at first. But stick around and you'll find plenty to do and see. "
Just OK,I don't really like the crowds. Some people might love it but not for me.. I enjoyed shopping at Insadong and Dongdaemun more. 
wanna shopping???? please go.,lots of stores from cheap to expensive...and many street food..you just prepare your credit card...and have fun !!!!
Gaget,"This a place that you can find all the things, but mostly some gaget, with good price, for eletronic consumers this is paradise :)"
Great spot - Myeongdong and Nadaemun Market,"We were very impressed with Liang Yanfeng of Natures Republic - not pushy and willing to explain the different products. This outlet is near to Grand Hotel. Lots of food to try and street food stalls comes out in the evening.Davich Optical Chain - specs made on the spot and if they can't get it ready before you leave, they will send it to you ! Am waiting for my pair to arrive next week."
Shopping Craze,"Most of my classmates (especially girls) were looking forward to come to this place. Its a mix of modern malls and street market. Very good food on the streets which is a must try. For shopping, u can just go literally anywhere since u are surrounded by it. Just take a walk, shop for things, dont buy at first sight, compare prices all around. We came at night and my classmates ask our teachers to extend staying at there for 2hours."
The most happening night street market ,"A very large night street market that sell variety of products like food, fruit, textile, souvenirs etc. a very big place that you may not cover every corner of the market. If you see anything that you like, just grab it coz you won't be able to return to that place anymore."
Shopping Paradise,"If you love shopping this place will be your paradise. Full of shops and kiosks where you can enjoy street food, ice cream and lunch & dinner. "
Myeongdong is A Must-Go :),"Myeongdong is a heaven for those who love shopping, Korean food, nice cafes, and it's the perfect place for solo travelers to walk around/or to just stand in one corner to absorb the experience of being there. I was there for more than 3 hours, spent one hour in a cafe having a cup of coffee as I wrote postcards for my friends.Everyone from everywhere was there. Shopping/window-shopping for skincare products, socks, caps, every must-have things from South Korea. The best of Seoul's street food were there, from the yummy grilled octopus on skewers, tteokbokkis, to the dragon beard candy.You can either get on a subway/taxi/bus to get to Myeongdong or walk to it if you're not that far away. I walked for 15-20 minutes from Cheonggyecheon Stream, navigated my way without a map since it wasn't necessary, The signage to Myeongdong everywhere were clear. I'd come here again to sit at a cafe and admire the alive-and-kicking Myeongdong."
Full of energy,"Myeondong district lives up to the hype as one of the best shopping districts in Seoul. It was streets upon streets of local and foreign stores. Most of the salesmen know how to speak english or to deal with foreigners. Make sure to plan ahead about where to go. We only had 5 hours to go around so we had to research for the stores we wanted to go to. It helped but in general 5 hours isn't enough to explore all of Myeongdong. Wear comfortable shoes. Stores I liked were Top 10, Beanpole, Uniqlo, Artshop, and H&M. Other stores at the side sold cheaper goods. I liked buying the socks with different patterns as souvenirs for 1000 won each. "
Cosmetics and skin care galore!,"Great place to check out and stock on cosmetics and skin care products.Many brands have multiple outlets most of which are a stone's throw away from each other.By evening time, many street carts are set up selling clothes, accessories and also food and drinks."
Bustling area,"While other areas such as Honde and Garosu are more charming and relaxing, Myeongdong is fascinating, with its bustling mix of large dept stores and street shops. It is very touristic (esp. Chinese tourists) but with flavors of real Korea. Particularly enjoyable are the street food stalls."
Hyper Type shopping market,This market looks like Chinese market. You get lot of Made in Korea stuff but I am almost sure they are China make. Especially I experienced while buying bags you could negotiate as low as 50% of the price towards the end of working day like after 6pm.I did not find anything authentic Korean but its a treat to see authentic Korean Street food stalls.
"Great street foods , excellent shopping place....","Had our conference in Incheon and made a quick trip to Myeongdong. We love the street food here and shopping for Korean brand make up, face powder, lipsticks, eyeliner, mascara, BB creams cheaper by 3 or by 6. Oh we love the fresh strawberry here.. Don't miss it!"
Authentic Street Market,"Our hotel was located at Myeongdong, and the street is really lively at night. Although it is open longer on weekends than weekdays. The streets offer a different array of street food, souvenirs, socks, clothes etc.It was the best place to get cheap souvenirs and eat authentic Korean street food.Be careful of pickpockets though as they frequent the street. "
Crowded with teens,"The area is full of street food stalls, restaurants and cosmetic shops, and Korean teenagers. Unless you are also a teenager there are much better areas in Seoul for dining and shopping (and also for street food)"
"Wonderfully convenient for shopping, street food and cafes!",We stayed at the Ibis in Myeongdong and we were really pleased with the location. The street food there was awesome and clean and we tried many of the local snacks. Very yum! There are just an abundance of face mask shops on every street corner! A place to go if you are into Korean beauty products. Staff in shops don't speak much English but can speak basic Mandarin. A definite must go!
ONE-STOP BEAUTY & FASHION STREET,"You need anything, just get it here! You need more than 3 hours here definitely. I come back here all the time!"
Great shopping area!,This place has great shops and everything opens until fairly late - I think some stores were opened until 11pm. There's also plenty of street food where you can enjoying eating while shopping!
Cosmetics and Fashion Paradise,"If you're here in Seoul for shopping, then this place is a must go, especially for young ladies. Korean fashion and cosmetics are now very popular in Asia and this is probably one of the best places to buy especially cosmetics like masks and facial cleaners. There are several well known shops, I would recommend Nature Republic which now has several branches abroad. There are also many restaurants serving Korean food, not expensive. Some restaurants give you a choice of removing your shoes and sit on a mat instead of a chair. I would recommend Westerners to opt for table and chairs as they may not be used to sitting on mat for long, may have to stand up every 10 minutes or so. There are two mini supermarkets further away from the shopping centre in case you may like to purchase drinks and snacks."
Asian shopping madness,"Myeongdong is a bustling pedestrian shopping area. Attracts lots of Chinese and Japanese tourists -- in fact if you look Asian you may be spoken to in Chinese instead of Korean! Not a place to find traditional stuff; rather, Myeongdong is full of cosmetics stores and clothing shops. The place is definitely a maze so research in advance if there is a particular shop that you are looking for."
Shopping frenzy,It's the Korean cosmetic heavy and you do shop till you drop. Every few steps you can see the same shops over n over again. Cheap masks n Chinese speaker workers. Must go for girls!
Absolute Fun,"There's so much to explore. There's something exciting in every single corner. Street food, Fashion, Cosmetics, Cats coffee - you name it, Myeongdong has it. The only down side is probably how crowded it always is... And how all those pretty clothes are not size4andabove friendly :) Other than that? Amazing "
Street you want visiting to do shopping,"It is Korea's famous shopping area where the streets are lined with departmental stores and shops that sell branded cosmetics, clothing, bags and shoes. There are also many eateries and cafes. We also saw many money changers where one can exchange from one currency to another..the place is busy and crowded. The pinpoint of Myeongdong is to lookout for ZARA. Enjoy our shopping."
Many places to explore,Do get a map of the place so you can navigate your way through the maze. Stop by to grab a bite when you feel like it or treat yourself to a cup of coffee as you see the crowd goes by. You can easily spend 2 days here and still discover lots of new food/stalls selling unique and interesting stuff. Do note that it's not easy to find a pharmacy and even if you do most of them do not speak English. Some stalls do speak mandarin due to the influx of Chinese tourists from China.
"Fun to See, TOO Crowded for Shipping","This is a fun place to come see what it's all about. There are tons to shops and restaurants. However, all the shops are chains, so can be easily found in other areas throughout the city. If you are looking to do some actual shopping, this place will be very inconvenient due to all the other tourists."
Shopping Heaven,"Best place to get all the most popular cosmetics Korea is famous for, with low price (negotiable sometimes when you buy alot!) with lots of complimentary gifts. Really the best place to get last minute souvenirs for friends back at home :)"
"Lots to See, Busy & Crowded",Main attraction? Face products & Cosmetics. Lots of eateries and fashion to spoil. Can pop by Noon Square shopping at the beginning of Myeongdong street. Bargain? Little. Good luck. 
Shopping spree,"No credit cards in street shops or food spots, but great huge stores around, from H&M to local designer stores. price ranges for everyone :) "
Cosmetics and Cafes,Very cheap cosmetics (w/ tax refund) with lots of freebies. There are also a lot of cafes where you can rest. (Try visiting one of the cat cafes!)
Busy shopping,"It's super crowded all the time in Myeongdong, but it's fun to see the workers outside all of the makeup shops trying to get you to go in. There's lots of street food to try. There's also a movie theater above the Uniqlo store."
Shopping!,A good place for shopping and the environment around the area is very happening! There's so many things to look at around that area. Worth the trip.
over crowded but great shopping,worth a look around if you are a shoppaholic. some fab shops and bargains. The place is over crowded especially in the evenings but the atmosphere is fab.
a lot of people,I enjoy shopping at the Myongdong street as compared to the Shopping mall. its 11 storey high but at the duty free area is full of tourist shopping local cosmetic. 
Worth a look around,"like a mini tokyo (sorry, no offence intended, just my view), with loads of brightly lit stores selling skincare products and clothing aimed at the younger female/females generally. There were lots of food vendors on the street which made for an interesting viewing experience, though one vendor got mega-annoyed when i tried to take a photo of his stand. If a middle-aged male there aren't going to be many stores here for you, but still worth a walk around."
shopping paradise!,"what else can I say? this is a paradise for shopping! cosmetics, fashion stuffs, foods, kpop stuffs, and many more. it's a bit too packed on weekend, though."
Sensory Overload!,"Wow! It's called ""hyper shopping"" for a reason . . .the whole area is energetic, crammed with food vendors, and tons of fashionable shops. The amount of cosmetic, glasses frames, and shoe options was simply overwhelming. Each shop blasted popular or techno music making the whole experience feel like a giant dance party. We found this area the most fun at night - a feast for the senses! Definitely not to be missed."
Best clothing market,"This place is where we can buy Korean clothing, cosmetics etc. It's nice to walk around and taste Korean food too. So many people from all over the world come here to shop. "
resort price,"in this sightseeing area, the thIng to buy is almost not reasonable but many lineup here.Great speaker in Japanese and ChInese are so many."
"Fun, good food and Value",it was fun to look at all the venders and the food was great. Plenty of items to look at and purchase. Just a real fun experience. 
"It's great if you're into local Korea brands, and there are plenty of good deals to be had","Myeongdong is a shopper's Mecca, that's for sure. I'm a skincare junkie who's into unique and stylish clothing that you can't get anywhere else, so I had a blast here. Look out for clothing brands like SPAO, which strikes me as the Korean version of Topshop (but significantly cheaper), and Teenie Weenie, which has cutesy clothes (some of which are Teddy Bear-themed although a handful are pretty fashionable). Skincare brands like The Face Shop, Tony Moly, and Skinfood line the streets of Myeongdong, so you'll be utterly spoiled for choice.The street food scene is also worth mentioning since you can get some good eats for a fraction of what you would pay at restaurants. The sausage skewers and the egg bread, which are priced at KRW3,000 and KRW2,000 respectively, are great if you want a cheap snack or dinner that's both filling and delectable."
cosmetics heaven!,"- anything regarding cosmetics are available here. - latest trend in clothes and accessories, shoes etc.- easy to access via subway- fast food restaurants are easily accessible here such as Lotteria, McDonalds- Myeongdong is so much fun at night! many people visit here at this time, and many more street vendors selling foods and clothes available at nightime"
Heaven for shipping lover!,"It's like a heaven for shopping lovers, especially women. You'll see many shops, whether clothing, cosmetics, accessories and so on. You might need at least 2 hours to see through the area."
shopping place,"good for shopping, but expensive .. cloth and a lot of souvenir shop .. brand comes-tic there .. hope can go again .. cloth there very special and new for me .."
"Nice vibe, lots of actuvity...but you may not buy anything!","Myeongdong is a great place to walk around. There's so much happening and many things to see, however, most of the items on sale here trend towards fashion and beauty products. There are loads of cafes, restaurants and little eateries, so there are always many opportunity to sneak a snack or a sip of coffee in between all that shopping. Let's be frank : Korea is not exactly a shopping Mecca in terms of pricing, but shopping here in Myeongdong is just throbbing with life, so you could end up like what I do all the time : I take it all in, but I don't take anything away, cos I go back home empty-handed, without having bought anything...because really, you don't have to shop in order to enjoy Myeongdong - that's how special this place is!"
Shopping Galore,"Lotte Department store has a duty free shop at the 9f, you can get the same cosmetics from popular Korean brands sold on the street shops at the 9f at duty free prices. But you can also get them at the duty free airport shops however, the choices are not as extensive as the ones at the 9f.... Don't forget to ask for a free item if you are buying in bulk!"
Shopping and nice dinner there,Cosmetic and clothes paradise!!! Many cosmetic shops and the price is very reasonable. The clothes are of high quality and ladies will find this place a must visit place and even visit again. 
Heaven Street Shopping,Its Heaven Street Shopping.. you'll find many many street food and many many street shopping but it cannot have more disc they give the fix price but i enjoy to walk and see alot of things and the most enjoy is the street food so enjoy your trip..
Shopping galore! ,"This place is definitely a ""must-go"" to women who wants to go shopping, whether cosmetics, clothes, shoes, etc.We saw shops with 1-3 branches within the area! If you get hungry, there are also a lot of food stalls on the streets and restaurants. There's definitely a lot of choices for you! "
one night is not enough,Free wi-fi at Uniqlo shop. Lots of street food to bite and fruit drinksStrawberry is fresh and soft and so sweet (I am not strawberry lover).
Never get enough of this,"This is definitely for woman, heaveennn!go on Thursday, the make up store will give bigger discount. Also try some street food, though a bit pricey but it's wort to try. If you want to take home some korean snack, please go to the corner. Some store sell cheaper than the store located on the center."
Shopping Heaven,"My first stop in Seoul. I was so excited when I reached Myeongdong. I can see all the Korean makeup brand, restaurants, food stalls and etc. Best place ever!"
Cosmetics heaven and street-food galore,"My fourth visit to Seoul and a short stop at this place of course, is a must. Most of the famous Korean cosmetics brands could be found here, some even have 3-4 shops scattered around this hectic area. Liptints, BB creams, CC creams, snail masks, ginseng masks, and so on are abundant at varied price range. So much fun just getting into the shops and see what new or amusing cosmetics products they got. Some of the salesperson here could be a bit aggressive but stand your ground and state clearly if you just wanna take a look around and they will (eventually) leave you to your own devices. The street-food here was also delightful. So many choices and all looked yummy. And quite cheap too. It was also fun just watching how they prepare the food. But this place could be absolutely chaotic and touristy, especially on weekends. Not the place to stroll leisurely and do some relaxed shopping. So many people swarming these look-alike alleyways. Very easy to get disoriented. Many of the stuff sold in the street stalls were cheap knockoffs. Fashion style here catered mostly for young adults and have petite sizes only. Thus for me, I only come for cosmetics window-shopping, street-food and to absorb some of the frenzied vibe of hyper-shopping."
Women's paradise,"There are a lot of restaurants but this place is really for women. Lots of Korean beauty products, cafes, restaurants and tons of street food. Must go to the Hello Kitty cafe and have a cake and latte. "
Loved it!,"I dont shop much but I thought the range and extent of beauty products were awesome! Snail cream anyone? What about ginseng mask? Hair mask too? One can never be too white or too poreless in this society. A little vanity is good for us.As for clothes, I think they're too small. Mostly free size. One store wont even let us try it on for size.Go here for food. And dont forget to look up. Shops, restaurants go vertical and horizontal. Im tempted to try a Korean haircut and spa. But language barrier might be a problem. Hay."
Ultimate Street Food Experience,"The street is very crowded with tourist and shoppers but that was fun! Be adventurous in trying Korean's street food.My goodness, they are delicious! Dakkochi and Egg Bread are my top favorite. Tteokbokki is a killer to me, it's too spicy but when I eat Tteokbokki with Dakkochi, it's a match! Yummy!"
Too hyper- shopping for me!,"I strolled through this district one evening and found it both overwhelming and disappointing. The streets were packed with shoppers carrying multiple shopping bags. The stores looked like typical chain stores of youthful fashion in the US. Every other store seemed to be a cosmetic store with aggressive sales ladies hawking beauty products at the door. If your idea of a cultural experience is walking through a gigantic outdoor shopping mall then rock on. Otherwise, I'd skip this and seek out other areas of the city with more pleasant experiences. I did find some very nice things in little shops in the Bukchon historic district - which is a very nice place to wander."
Noisy,Too many people in one space. Advertising galore. Brand name peoples paradise but not for me. Noisy and competition.... I like to shop in peace thanks. 
A must go!,"For shopping, trying exotic new street food, this is the place you have to go. You can easily kill 6 hours walking around eating experiencing all of it. It is also really close to City Hall, Namdemun market, Just remember to go to a coffee shop or restaurant to get some energy so you can keep going!"
Shop of a lifetime!,"Myeongdong definitely became one of my favorite places in the world! Neon lights, shops and especially bargains! If I could, I'd sleep at the shops and never leave!"
"If you love shopping, and food... and beauty products, this is it...","My hotel was not far Myeongdong's shopping area so it was easy to walk to it one afternoon.First thing that will hit you is the bustling activity every where you turn. When you arrive it's probably best to set a mental marker or meeting spot if you get separated from your group. There are streets and alleys in all directions and it's easy for you to get a bit disoriented if you're not paying attention. Luckily most alleys have a number, so take note when you start your shopping journey.Most products are ""on-sale"" but a friend of mine who lives in Seoul says most vendors will bargain with you. Take a chance, you'll never know.There are tons of beauty products for sale, the most popular having to be the ""Snail Facial Mask"" Those are everywhere. Some cost a few dollars each, others a little less. Every once in a while a new vendor will show up in the middle of the street and open a box of scarfs or shirts and the frenzy begins. Fun to watch and also take part. If you know what you are looking for, an hour or two here will do.Plenty of food vendors and restaurants also in the area."
Shopping Time,"Myeongdong is a popular shopping paradise. Most tourists came here to shop for souvenirs, clothings, shoes and skin care products. Lots of street food are sold here too."
Shopper's Heaven!!!!,"This place has it all. Clothes, shoes, cosmetics, more cosmetics, knick knacks. There are restaurants and street food after about 6pm. Love the local street food like fried glass noodles and korean noodles. Just can't have enough of this. Greeeeeat shopping experience. If you ran out of money, the exchange by the Chinese Embassy (behind Korea Post Tower) has the BEST exchange rates. Thoroughly enjoyed myself."
So crowded but you will like it!,"Kept going back there to have a walk and shopping with friends. Very nice place to shop, especially for girls."
Too many tourists,"Great place to shop but be aware that there will be a lot of tourists especially from other parts of Asia. Every time I've been to anywhere near or even in Myeongdong, including the duty free, I have been pushed and shouldered way too many times so I avoid this place as much as I can."
Shop!,The place to go if you're a shopaholic! A few big malls within each other with Doota! being the best for fashions. Opens til wee morning!
happy place to shop,it was so full of different stuff to buy. I was surprised that people trust so much that they just put their money on the table and continue selling their stuff . not worried if people will robbed them . I will go back again to this market
A Shopper's Heaven,Everything you need to shop for in one area. Very convenient. Everything from the luxurious Shinsegae to the street vendors. 
Shop till drop,"Check in hotel to see other guests checking in & checkin out with huge luggages. After settling in the hotel, we went out & understand why those huge luggages. Its mask shops, trendy shops, shoes, food, H & M, Zara, Forever 21, SPAO, Topten 10. Every ally & every corners, you can find face mask shops packed in 10s or 20s. At nite its even more lively, when the food stores are out. Mostly fixed at WON3000, you can try all kind of food from strawberry coated with syrup, freshly squeezed orange, sausages, bun with fried egg..... two nites is enough. High end shopping at Lotte Department store where China tourist flocked to buy branded luxury items & queue for refunds. The department store was so crowd & noisy. We wandered down to the basement to hunt for food. We found korean condiments like kimchi, fermented squids, anchovies. No worries can pack for you nicely so that you bring home. Spoil for choice....free sample to taste ..."
Lots of unique items,"Awesome shopping, everything from trendy high end items to local art and street vendors. Defiantly worth a visit"
Shopping wonderland,"This is a great place to just shop until you drop! This is not your high end shopping. This is where you will find everything from socks to mink coats but they are not in bright lights and marbled floors but street stalls. I love going here. You can also bargain with them. If you do not like the price then just walk away, if they can go down more they will call you back, if that is their final offer they will let you go. Silk purses, beautiful bedding, clothes galore, shoes. Purses are a big thing. Most of the time it will not be the ""real thing."""
luxury goods,"Good if you like to shop for high-end luxury goods. Some nice malls. Not my thing though. I prefer the Naedamun market instead, but I generally like outdoor markets. Went during the day so perhaps it gets more crowded at night. "
"Cosmetics, clothes, and everyting else","I LOVE Myeongdong. I've stayed in hotels in this region on both of my trips to South Korea and plan on doing so again when I return. As a Canadian living in China, my favourite shop here is Forever21, as well as Etude House (a Korean cosmetics brand). You can find both of these shops within close proximity of each other in other parts of the city (near the university, for example), but the energy and atmosphere of Myeongdong can't be beat."
Beware of unethical sales person ,"First day arrived came to MyeongDong to buy lots of cosmetic stuff. I was served by a Chinese lady who speaks fluent Chinese/Korean, she gave me some samples after my purchased. A day later, I went to the same shop but at Sinsa area, then only realized when purchased 2 lipsticks will get another 1 for free. (3 for 2 $). The MyeongDong branch didn't inform me about this nor giving me any free lipstick. I suspect the sales ladies kept for their own use, or other purpose. Will not going back there to purchase anymore. Very touristy area, crowded. "
Shop and eat,"Good place to shop for face mask and cosmetics. Sales assistants can communicated in chinese or english, so no issue communicating them if you know the language. The items not very cheap but free gifts are still quite abit. Tax refund office available so you can do a cash refund and continue shopping, however, the tax refund counter not easy to spot. Food wise not bad, should try the myeongdong dumpling."
Great especially in the evenings!,"We accidentally got here, but so god we did! Loved being here in the evening when all the stalls came out and we could eat delicious street food and crazy strawberries. Aim to be there around sunset and you can stay well into the night! There's a hello kitty cafe in this area as well. :)"
Shopping and shopping,"A lot of things to buy especially cosmetics. And I love the food, from local restaurants to coffee bean and starbucks and of course I love the street foods. Relatively safe. A lot of people even at night."
Over commercialized tourist spot,"I was at Myeongdong about 5 years ago and it was a pleasant experience. The sales assistant from the beauty shops were friendly and generous. This time, I find that not only some of the sales assistant were rude but also the service wasn't that great. The price is also higher for clothes etc. If I'm going to buy any beauty products I would prefer going to other branches elsewhere (just fyi, there are ALOT of beauty products shops EVERYWHERE in SEOUL - Ewha, Hongdae, Insadong, Samcheongdong, Gangnam etc)."
Tourist spot but worth a visit,"Lots of shop, lots of similar shops with similar brands as well. Lots of tourist. But they are many local cuisine restaurants. Worth a visit"
Crowds of people--very safe,"Every night, so many people. Lots of young people and lots of police..very safe place to shop at night.Lots of food vendors...great food!"
"So much to see, buy, eat and do!","Wow! So many stores, so much delicious street food and so many people. Everyone was having fun and so were we! I only wish we had another day to explore. We tried just about every type of street food and loved it all. Bonus tip: Find the dog cafe, grab a refreshment and watch the skateboarding dogs!"
Crazy,"You have to see Myeongdong. It is a crowded, frenzied shopping experience....big stores, small stores, street vendors, food vendors. Something for everyone. Fun, grea vibe."
Nice Place,Nice place to roam around. During X'max time decoration is really good. You can get chip and midium rate cloths around the market.
"Girls' makeup and cosmetics paradise, and guys can watch girls","Myeongdong is indeed a shopping haven, for girls especially. There are tonnes of cosmetic shops and outlets and all have some kind of offers going on at certain times. Oh, and some shops even have multiple branches in myeongdong alone. Skincare, mask, lotion, shampoo, anything you name it, they have it. For guys like me, besides enjoying the view of the girls shopping, I also like to go around the branded clothes stores like Uniqlo, Forever21, H&M etc. They usually have the latest collection for the season and with good pricing too. Of course they are a bit pricier than the likes of Namdaemun thrifty shops, but you get what you pay for.If you want to spend time shopping in Myeongdong, I suggest allocate a few hours at least, as the area is huge with lots of backalleys with more shops in them. Besides cosmetics and clothings, Myeongdong also offers lots of kinds of street foods, from tornado potatoes to 30cm long soft-icecream. Night time is the best time to spend here but be aware that the shops closes at 10pm so plan your time."
Fun shopping experience,"Huge shopping district that has a range of low to mid to high end stores. Especially great if you're into Asian cosmetics, it's practically Mecca. It's outdoors, so not the best place to go on a cold, rainy day, but I had fun regardless."
"Skin care shopping, girls' paradize",Almost all skin care brands can be found here. Except Sulwashoo. The local Korea brands are all available here. The trick is to consolidate the items you want to buy and get a higher cap for tax refund in one shop. Go for the bigger shops so that they carry more range.
Shopping Haven,"This is the best place for shopping and eating street foods. A little bit pricey though for souvenirs, I suggest insadong market instead if you will buy a lot. Definitely fun strolling this busy and lively place at night, we love spending our free time in this shopping haven."
Nice shopping experience,We loved the shopping area. It's easy to get there by metro or cab. Even the underground shopping possibilities are worth to see it.
One of the best places for street food,"The place is bustling with life! Every possible store you imagine is on this street. It's a clothes and cosmetics haven!!! The best part is the street food carts lined up in the middle of it all, and everyone of them is worth a try. Try the potato twists with sausage, it was really good!"
"Street Food, Cosmetics, Clothes...","One of the most popular shopping areas in Seoul. Cosmetics and fashionable clothing shops dominate the area, with street food vendors throughout the streets. Prices vary greatly for clothes here, though cosmetics and skincare are quite standard. Be sure to try the tteokbokki wrapped in a sausage. Must visit!"
STREETFOOD HAVEN,I'm not that into shopping... what I liked about this place is the number of streetfood stalls along the streeeet! 
Shopping Heaven!,"You can buy almost everything here especially the cosmetics;)...Famous brand such as Zara,H&M,Adidas and MCM also has their boutique here."
Korea's ultimate shopping destination!,"This is definitely the place to shop in Seoul! There are a lot of shops and boutiques to choose from. There are also a lot of vendors selling delicious Korean street food! If you love shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, etc., try to visit LesMore! A lot of those brands are always on sale. A got a pair of Nike Air Max in that shop! I will go back and shop again in this place when I visit Seoul again."
Many shopping choice but must be careful with price offered,"I like the many choice of product offered. I don't like the price, If not careful,might be easily fooled by the seller's high pricing. Must be dare to bargain"
Popular area,"Very popular shopping area for stores and shops, not as many street vendors (except food). Very crowded on weekends and has great dining, theaters, etc."
Myeongdong,"Place is small but one will be spoilt for variety. Besides, the place is so lively. I enjoyed this place particularly for its street food"
Heaven for cosmetic shoppers and good restaurant,Love this place. Love the shops ..the food ...the hair salon and the street food. Money changer is at every corner with good rates. A must visit for all tourist.
Great place to shop and eat,"Great place to shop and eat. For shopping, please check your receipt and amount before paying as one of the beauty shop charges me lots more. I was tooo happy shopping and forget to check.Nevertheless, i will still come back again to shop and eat. There are lots of beauty shops so take your time and pick. ^_^"
Must Visit for Shopping!,My girlfriend and I visited there and find that there are many shops selling cosmetics and fashion products that almost all girls must be crazy there.It opens till very late night with restaurants.Dont miss it if you love shopping.
Excellent for shopping and eating,"If you are looking for cosmetics and food, Myeongdong is best location. Don't forget to try Korean Traditional Restaurant Owooga - Korean BBQ dish but served with fresh and more varieties of vegetable, delicious bamboo rice as well. This restaurant location is just opposite The Grand hotel."
A must-go place in Seoul..,"Our family just love Myeongdong. Particularly my wife and daughters. We also booked our hotel here.This place is very different from other places we been to. There is so much buzz and 'live' in this place. This is a ladies's paradise for cosmetics, clothes, shoes, accessories, etcFood is abundant and varied.The subway is located within Myeongdong with different exit points, and the airport bus limousine stops just outside on main road."
Great shopping,A must visit place at Seoul if you like cheap shopping... The streets are filled with varieties of commodities at a very cheap price... But there's a great scope of negotiating as none of the products are fixed priced... The place is just by the subway station... 
if you love shopping....,"A must see if you're looking to get your shopping fix. Myeongdong features several streets full of shops, both international as well as Korean brands. Not every store is as cheap as you may expect, but there's plenty to choose from. Also, there are a lot of local food street vendors, so you can definitely try Korean street food. The place is quite tourist friendly. The only negative remark I have is that you have many stores you'll find more than one time just a street or two apart, so there overall number of individual stores is lower than what you may think. Avoid the underground shops as they typically sell the cheap stuff. But anything else is worth seeing."
A haven for shopping,Must visit for cosmetics and beauty care products. Reasonably priced and lots of choices. Easy to get through via public transport.
Shopping & Eating Mania,"Myeongdong is Seoul's best place for mod shopping and variety of eating.From Alaska to Tibet you can find shops and foods here if you have a will to walk in crowds for shopping - clothes, shoes,cosmetics, fashion accessories,coffee shops, cakes, fruits and juices, ice creams, jewelry, Ginseng,Music,Massage parlours, culture and Theater. 8 full streets to walk around,No cars allowed inside- well connected by subway Lines 1 and 4. American, English,Italian,Spanish ,Thai, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Tibetan & Vietnam food restaurants are plenty and you can select by your time and money. Discounts offers and gifts galore.Try your luck.OR PRAY AT NEARBY CATHEDRAL."
A must visit if first time in Seoul,"Fun place to walk around and eat. I'd say a must visit when you're in Seoul. Myungdong Kyoja is my favorite place to eat. Their dumplings and kalguksu are the best. You can also pick up good iphone (or other phone) cases, luggage tags, face masks, or any other accessories there. The best deal is if you want to get prescription glasses. There's a place across the street from the Lotte Department Store where you can get your glasses for <$100 (frames and prescription) and you get it the same day."
shop til you drop,"Shopping area! many things to buy here! can be crowded, but the crowd really add up to the hectic atmosphere.many foods to buy! "
Great place to try Korean street food,"I find the place eclectic and very tourist friendly, as most stall operators have signals to indicate price. "
street food,"We went here at night just for the street food, the atmosphere is buzzing and you can sample many foods or just shop if that is what you fancy...."
Shop till you drop!,"This place is literally a bee hive of activity. Street foods, clothes, make up, shoes for which Seoul is known for is in this place. However, HM, Zara, Uniclo have their shops here. It is hard to bargain as prices are generally fixed. Best buys are Korean made leather shoes, shirts, jackets and coats and make up and skin care (Etude House, Face Shop, Skin Food etc.). The side streets have small cafes, bistros and restaurants. For the less adventurous, Mc Donald's and KFC have branches in this area, too. More shopping awaits you in the subway. Stores are open from 10 am to 11 pm."
Many kind of korea cosmetic product can find here. And also ........food.,"Wow, want to find some place for shopping?. Cool place with many kind of cosmetic products. And you can find traditional Korea food here. I highly recommended this place."
The spot for late-night shopping spree!,"Myeongdong is bustling in the evening. There are lots of beauty shops such as Missha, Nature Republic, Etude etc. Cosmetic products are definitely cheaper than in my country (Singapore). Bought two packs of 10s Missha BB Creams at SG$9 each (retailed at SG$20+ in Singapore). Cheap cheap cheap! And you're in for some free goodies too."
free photo experience,"Myeongdong is good for buying korean cosmetics and young fashions. BUt, what we enjoyed most was the foc experience in imperial costume with a simulated ( green screen) background- at the KEB in Myeongdong."
Eh - skip it and go shopping in Duty Free...,"Myeongdong used to be a great place to go shopping (like the area around Ewha University) but in the last 3-4 years, it has become overrun by beauty product stores. It's still fun to hang out around Myeongdong in the evenings when the sidewalk and food vendors come out -- great people watching, good cheap food. But if you have a few days in Seoul, there are so many things to do, I'd skip Myeongdong, buy the face products in Incheon Airport's Duty Free, and hit up some of the other more interesting sites and areas in and around Seoul."
A beauty's paradise,"This small area is lined with SO MANY shops offering facial products and make-up, it's believable. There are many branches of the same shop as well (i.e. there was probably 5 branches of each brand on each lane!). I would suggest people read up a little on the products available from the different brands as you can literally lose yourself in the shop. The number of free gifts differ from each shop/ branch so walk around a little to see what are the best deals.If you can't speak Korean, no worries. Most shops would have at least 1 staff member able to speak English and definitely Mandarin."
Best place to buy cosme,"If you are looking for affordable/good quality Korean make up and creams, go here. All the streets are filled with tons of cosme shops for all the likes, even for men."
Shopping Haven,"Never miss Myeondong when you visit Seoul. Plenty of branded stores such as H&M, zara etc. in one area plus night market. Restaurants are also around the area with diverse cuisine such as Japanese, Korean, chinese and American. "
"Very nice place, feels very modern","I travelled alone on a business trip. Went to meyong dong and these streets are amazing. Very crowded but i was the only western on the streets. Felt absolutely safe and at home. Many restaurants, both traditional and KFC/outback steakhouse. Many cosmetics shops, many food stands. Really enjoyable evening!"
endless shopping,"its crazy so is so many shops and shops after shops, things to buy here is not cheap, but there is just so many things to buy..so there you are lost and found i suggest if you were to stay in Seoul for five days, make sure you come here everyday.. the air is fresh, no pushing, just free and easy to buy anything. (i am very into cosmetic)"
It's definitely a shopping playground for ladies!,"Myeondong is always full of live and I'm still amazed by it even though this is my second time visiting after more than 7 years. Most of stores are cosmetics stores and the prices are quite competitive. Apparently, if you're buying brands like Laneige, the advise I got was to purchase the cosmetics here as they give you loads of samples and sometimes special discounts, but purchase the skincare range at the airport in order to get your tax refund. But either way, you'll be spoiled with choices at Myeondong, and be prepared to go nuts! There are of course the clothes stores as well, with some local brands to choose from. And in between all this madness, you still get to try out the street food, shop for souvenirs or hop into one of their popular cafes at almost every corner! Quite obvious I'm a big fan of this shopping street. Will be back again for sure."
Buy facial masks here and here only!,"People told me that if i come here, i will get free stuffs from the make up stores. Actually, that didnt happen just like that. Coz after u get the freebie, you will be ushered into the store n a shop assistant will accompany u! Oh well, this means u hv to buy smtg. But ok by me coz i wanted to get those famous snail facial mask for friends n family. I went to Toly Moly to get the snail masks, and also a pen-like eyeliner (which is easy to use). Also went to the face shop n nature republic which are in almost every corner. The make ups were interesting n affordable n cute! Another thing to do here is to try the street foods. There's also halal food like kebab and some sweet snack like mochi (but not quite). And you can also get souvenirs like korean doll ( w5000) or get cheap socks (w1000). I think it's worth the experience to come here. Well at least I enjoyed it!"
Marvelous Myeongdong!,"OK, this had got to be the most awesome place to be in Korea! I've read from others that is specifically for girls, ladies, women or i guess for the female gender. Not Really! There are lots of food outlets, restaurants, bars, also stores for teenage boys and a few for us men like suits. There is also an outlet where you can have yourself and your family in a traditional hanbok, and have your picture taken. The most spectacular transformation is when the sun sets. Ambulant vendors set up stalls and besides other apparels and souvenirs plus blankets, there are the street foods! Now these are delicious! They are definitely clean and hygienic, believe me. Koreans are very health conscious. The shrimp tempura is fresh. I know cuz i cook. And you guys should try the barbecued octopus! its tender. There is also the usual bibimbap (traditional korean rice with a mix of veggies, kimchi and chicken or beef or pork) I mean this place is awesome! The only time its quiet is around 6 am to 11 am. After that, the place is lively! For Shopper and foodies out there, When in Korea, you have got to go to Myeongdong!"
Overrated,"It was cool, there are so many shops but the items are either the same price as everywhere else or more expensive than usual. It is nice to go there for the atmosphere but don't expect any great deals! There are lots of different types of street-food though!"
love!,"You'll find everything here, especially the Korean brands, sumptuous Korean food. I especially love the street foods, yay! The goods, souvenirs & all can be bought in a very affordable price. :)"
Place to get what you want,"Recommended to all travelers to get skincare, cosmetic, toy, and foods here. Normally, this is the last stop if you follow tour agency. If you travel free and easy, better come and check here first before you compare other places."
Standard shopping area,"Myeongdong is an area with the exact same shops, selling the exact same stuff as anywhere else in Seoul. The only difference is that there is a lot of it. The street food is pretty decent and we definitely enjoyed a few good snacks, but really, the area doesn't inspire the imagination."
Shopping and food,"All the latest trends in clothing, not the cheapest place for shopping but quality over quantity for sure.Youll never be hungry or cold in this place....This place is a must "
Never the Same,"Constantly evolving, Myeongdong is one of those places that deserve a seasonal visit. The crowd is what makes Myeongdong shine and depending on the state of the currency exchange rate of nearby countries, you will find yourself in a flood of either Japanese or Chinese tourists plugging up the hundreds of shops and restaurants in this dynamic area. The best feature, however, is the street food that line up the pedestrian only streets."
The Temple of Mr. Pizza,"I love this part of the city.Always thick with crowds.Always fantastic street food.Always awesome shopping.Don't be offended that they don't want you to try the clothing on, they don't want the locals to either.Be sure to drop into Mr.PIzza while you're there."
Food paradise ,Most of the people would think about shopping here but not for me. After seeing a lot of choices for a street local food I suddenly change my mind from shopping here hahahaha. Besides I think it would be perfect for ladies here since they have a lot of cosmetics boutiques here a long the road. Plus the scarf is surprisingly cheap here you guys should give it a try.
Surprised by negative comments,"We enjoyed our visit to Myeongdong shopping district. I am used to the crowds in Hong Kong, and so wasn't fazed by the lesser crowds here, above or below ground. We found the whole area very clean, despite the crowds and all the little cooking stalls in the lanes, there was no food debris, no oil stain, no paper litter, anywhere on the ground. We were a bit mystified how street pedlars could cook in the middle of the lanes, to find electricity wires neatly bundled alongside the stalls. We had to carry our used boxes for blocks before we could find a rubbish bin, and in the end were happy to give them to an elderly man obviously collecting cardboard paper. Shopping was fun to look around, and see what is available, and how they compare with home. There was so much cosmetics and ladies wear. What do guys buy? We bought some 'snail' face masks, and something called 'cc cream"" without intending to, because of the special deals and discounts on offer. And we had afternoon tea with strawberry cakes and coffee. Very civilised. I didn't see any of the bad temper that others wrote about. The sales staff were all polite and anxious to please, and we had no difficulty walking away without purchasing, even after my hand was exfoliated, cleaned, lubricated, and nourished to the nth degree. We were surprised that the major second language used by sales staff was Mandarin, and that so many of them are from China! So while we can't speak a word of Korean, we had a very successful shopping expedition using Mandarin. And I forgot to mention the ubiquitous Korean ginseng products, and all the 'special' prices and deals we were offered. The prospect of getting tax refunds at the airport made the deals even sweeter as we did mental arithmetics to work out the actual costs. It was a successful and fun shopping day although we didn't buy all that much. I am sorry that other reviewers didn't enjoy it as much as we did."
Shopping strip and cafe hopping,"Myeondong can get really crowded but its a good place to buy skincare, facial masks and make-up from brands like Etude House, Natural Republic, Innisfree, Face shop, Laneige. Almost all the shops there sell facial masks (mostly selling in packs of 10 pieces of mask for around 10,000KRW). Look for the promo of 1+1 (get 2 packs for the price of 1 - good deal). If you are looking for high-end skincare brands, this is not the place. As for clothing, there are many local brands in small boutiques that sells nice designs at reasonable prices. Otherwise, you can also find Zara, Forever 21 and H&M within the area. If you are hungry or thirsty, there are also tons of cafes and restaurants around.Whats interesting is that in the evening, many street vendors will set up along the area selling all kinds of merchandise and street food as well. I especially like the cute socks selling at 1,000KRW per pair. If street shopping is not your thing, there is Young Lotte Plaza and Lotte Dept Store nearby. To get here, take the subway to Myeongdong station and exit 7."
Don't go if you can't spend a lot in each shop (時常黑面）,"My friends and I went to Myeongdong many times, and we got very bad experience there. We do like shopping and dining there, but somehow they'll show their temper / unfriendly attitude if you just buy little stuff or nothing to buy in the shop. Not only retail shops, but restaurants. So-called shopping paradise, just so so.對於旅客來說，明洞係一個非常出名的購物地點！但係如果在店鋪只消費少少或者完全無消費，售貨員就立即黑面、發脾氣！這裡絕對稱不上係一個購物天堂！所謂的購物熱點就是這樣！"
One of our favorite places in Seoul!,"Just love this shopping area! Has a modern, fun-filled feel to it with tons of cafes, clothing and accessory shops, street food, etc. As the day goes on, more street vendors also set up so that by night it's almost hard to walk through the streets, but they have some awesome products and deals. You will find that about 1/4th of the stores sell cosmetic products and they have girls outside trying to lure you in with free face mask handouts.We purchased many clothing items here for about $10 USD each. They were super cute and things we can't find here. Also tons of cute sock stores for $1 a pair. You can find more high end stores here as well, but that isn't what we were looking for.As a bonus, the Myeongdong subway station (underground) is also a fairly good sized mall with lots of great little stores selling inexpensive merchandise. If you, by chance, are looking for KPOP related items, the store underground near exits 6, 7 and 8 had the best prices we found in the city. Most albums only $10 and lots of cute other accessories for $1-5 each."
You have to love shopping to go here.....,"Myeongdong is always jammed with people, always. You can go here just to see the crowd and do some people watching but after that don't do much. Shopping here is so uncomfortable but if you really want to try, go ahead. "
Best spot for shopping and eating,"Love myeong dong! It has so many options, from dining/lunch to shopping. We were there when they had massive sale, so we kinda go crazy in shopping. Lots of shops selling 1000won cute socks, love it! They also have lots of face care shops. In short, you can shop all you need in one place here. Totally love it and would definitely come to visit again. "
Shopping center,"Quite similar to Siam square area in Bangkok, it is full of cosmetic and brand name shops, food street and tourists. Food there are relatively expensive than in other shopping centers."
Everything we thought Seoul would be!,"This area is absolutely bonkers. Very bright, very loud, very fast. Try everything on offer from the street vendors!"
Soooo many shops and freebies,At night it is crazy. Sooo many people and soo many freebies. You walk past a skin shop and you are given loads of free stuff. A woman could literally walk down the street twice and get enough free stuff to last you a few months. There are many cafes and restaurants etc and little food stalls. I would recommend going at night when it is lively and more fun ;)
"Shop, dine and sleep","You have heard all you want about Myeongdong, definitely a great place to buy skincare and beauty products. Majority of the shops will have one Chinese-speaking staff. Compared to last year, there are more Chinese-speaking waiters/waitresses in restaurants too. So much so that sometimes you may wonder if you are indeed in Seoul. It certainly helps if you speak Chinese. But personally I find some of them at the beauty store too pushy. Service level differs from store to store. But overall, Myeongdong has everything you need and we like this area."
paradise for shopaholic,"many shops, restaurants and a few department stores in this area. basically you can shop from 10am till midnight. shop till you drop"
the perfect place to feel the crowd,"Myeongdong is famous and probably a must go place when you are in Seoul, it is filled with shops, snack vendors, small-big department stores and restaurants! When you are in Myeongdong, don't forget to look up, as sometimes the best coffee shops and where you can find a place to people watch or simply take a rest from the crowd are situated on the upper floors of buildings! Best place to find cute, unique things and girls, for all the cosmetic shops you can imagine! And if you are a fan of Korean music, there's a huge CD/music store at the main entrance of Myeongdong, there's enough posters and special packaged CDs to please everyone."
Shop Till You Drop,"This shopping district is perfect if you want name brand clothing from popular stores {Zara, Uni Qlo, Top Ten Ten} around the world, Korean specific brands, and even local boutiques where you can bargain, which I'd highly recommend. Just make sure you put on your best poker face. Also, a great place to get street food though it will be overpriced."
A fun night out. ,"If you're looking for cheap and interesting gifts for people back home, this is where you should go. Myeongdong is one of the places in Seoul that offers a night market. The scene is very lively with vendors selling socks, hats, scarves, street food of all colors, taste and levels of spicyness, amazing Korean make-up and skincare stuff, and so much more. The night we were there, the temperature was below freezing, so we ducked inside a Dunkin Donut store and ordered warm coffees and donuts to warm up our blue hands and faces. We went out again and shopped for silly stuffs after an hour or so. There's a lot of banks/ATM's in the area if you find yourself short of cash after haggling with stuff you never thought you'll need. Great place to people watch, enjoy the Seoul night market scene and score some cute socks, mostly for almost a dollar each. "
For shopping fanatics - too much for us,"A must see... the shopping crazy asian approach. From a European point of view: overpriced, and wondering what they do with those cosmetic patches applied to breasts and buts..."
Deals deals deals,"If you like shopping and deals, this is the place for you! Anytime you buy stuff it always comes with free stuff. This place has some of the best beauty products on the planet, hands down. A must see!"
Best place to shop around,"If you are a shopaholic, this is a place you must visit, and must book a hotel at nearby,the shopping street mostly is skin product,foods , souvenir and clothes. But when i walk along the shopping street, i found out there are repeat same shop like etude house,face shop,skin food,nature republic and much more. Beside this, there are lotte duty free and lotte department store nearby this shopping street,you can buy a lot of cheap, duty free and branded at there also."
Shopping District,"It really great to spend your time in here. Cosmetics, Skin Care, and FoodThis district will call you to shopping, so many Korean brand in here. Come and visit the store you will get free sample. If you buy some amount (if I'm not mistaken, 5000 Won), there also many samples for you, include mask. Some how there many discount offer.Try also ice cream, 3000 Won and so many street food..Just recommended only buy cosmetics and skin care only ya. Other product might expensive."
"Fun and lively, but repetitive","Myeongdong is always fun and lively. Unfortunately for some reason the shops are very repetitive. Walking around I must have found more than 5 Etude Houses, Face Shop, Skin Food, Art Box, and so on. It's like Groundhog Day!"
Loved the atmosphere,We arrived just after lunch time and the pedestrian streets we manageable. But when we returned a few hours later the place had transformed. There were street stalls everywhere. Great place to spend more than a few hours
ABSOLUTELY THE BIGGEST SHOPPING AREAS I HAVE SEEN!!,"As a K-POP Lover, I was really happy to be in Myeongdong:) I got to find a lot of Kpop albums and bought a lot of kpop albums:)I would say if you are cosmetics and fashion lover this is the place for you. Moreover, the street food is absolutely delicious and clean at the same time.If you are going to Korea put this in your list:)"
Shopping paradise,Such a great place to shop! A variety of local and international brands at great bargains! The sales promoters who stand outside the skincare shops who give out samples are pretty aggressive though. They put samples in my hands but I didn't enter the shop and just walked on and she chased me and snatched the sample out of my hand. I guess you have to at least go in if you want to keep the samples.
"Ok, but way too crowded on weekend","If you need clothes, to watch a movie, or many places to eat, it's got variety and good street food, but on weekends, good luck comfortably walking around. Masses walk as slowly as possible looking at their phones or starting blankly at store fronts. Street vendors sell socks and scarfs in the middle of the street blocking the paths. God forbid there is ever a fire. Thousands will be trampled to death with no room to move."
"Mainly cosmetics, street food, fashion.","Vibrant, opens late at night, very family friendly. Lots to eat buy and see. Fun place to end the evening. Was staying at the fringe of Myeondong - everything very convenient."
Street shopping and street foods,"Have you ever been to DTLA on a Sunday morning and gone knock-off brand shopping? That's what this is but with more people, more food options (which were actually good for the most part), and actual name brands! So, if you like walking through throngs of people vying to purchase the latest leggings and Cucci glasses, this is your place!"
Too much tourists,"As a hyper shopping district, the place was very industrialised and almost too touristy. Everyone was screaming towards you, prices are all raised and its crowded all the time. Its one of those places that you only need to see once and you never want to go back again. "
"Typical tourist area, but fun","My family and I stayed in a hotel in the area February 12 - 16. I was a little disappointed that at 10am there wasn't much going on, however it was very cold. We went to a tourist thing and then returned in the afternoon/evening. WOW. What a difference a few hours brings!The area was packed with people. The smell of the food was wonderful. Stands for food and trinkets everywhere.Personally, I like areas like this. Really much more to see than at a mall.Exchange rates here were better than the airport or hotel at the time we were there.It was really too cold for our toddler to be out too long. I would like to go again when the weather is warmer and we can explore more."
"Living the locals culture, with food and shopping","An interesting place to taste Korea by sampling some snack food, including that delicious savory algae sheets and feel the strong commercial activity and shopping, and everybody offering you the most original things as well as common ones. Of course, don't hesitate for dribbling in each place"
Shopping + party,"Easily the highlight of my first ever Seoul trip. We walked around the maze of streets to cheerful hollers from perky sales ladies and bopping Kpop tunes blaring from shops, lugging our bursting shopping bags because you don't need to go anywhere else in Seoul for your cosmetics/skin care binge. Your favorite affordable/midrange brands are here and since they are ALL here, competition (read: freebies and sales) are fierce. Street food, clothing stalls, coffee shops, cafes and restos also abound. I can easily get lost here all day and never complain."
"Shopping, Food and Crowds","If you like shopping, eating and people watching, Myeongdong is for you. This place has many stores catering to almost everything, from Korean skincare/makeup shops to brand name clothing and fast food restaurants. If you get tired from shopping you can always rest your feet in a nearby coffee. The best time to go here would be the evening since the food vendors come out. It was a great experience."
Enjoy good food,I was there last year and I enjoyed a food there very much although the crowd might make you feel a bit dizzy but overall was so impressed!
Must go,"Very nice place for shopper and don't get lose.I went there and take 2 days to finish whole place Also, must go for bubble tea (Gongcha) ^&^"
Shopping Paradise for Cosmetics!,You could find as many as Korean cosmetic brands and feel the vibrant Seoul life in Myeong-Dong!
"Place for Nightlife,Shopping,Food, Shows",Shopping haven for families especially teeners. A lot of food choices and great shows to watch.You can still do shopping at night here since shops close late at night.
Shopping Haven,This is the place to go for Korean cosmetics and other shopping! Lots of restaurants and food outlets too.
"Fashion, cosmetics, food and skincare products","Myeongdong is jam-packed with shops which sell trendy fashion, cosmetics and skincare products. I am not particularly interested in those products in Korea. I saw lots of people walking around at night. It was noisy at night because there were so many people around and the K-pop music from the clothing stores there. I was more interested in the street food displayed by the food vendors which come out at night. You should go to Myeongdong with an empty stomach. No need to worry about that you may not have enough Korean won as there are a lot of foreign currency exchange shops."
Sensory Overload,Love the area. lots of shops...small boutiques to larger chain stores. Can get a bit redundant after awhile but still enjoyable to watch the people move around and see all that there is to buy.
Shopping Heaven!,"Really a very big shopping area! SM's merchandise store also located there. Can't really finish it even with half day! I think we need a day to cover most of the place. G Dragon's clothing store is also located at myeongdong! Not to forget, lots of street food there!"
Best place for street shoppers,"Lots of cheap items and food stalls. Most stalls close around midnight. Lots of beauty shops. If you walk further down the street, you can find a lot of coffee houses for those restless legs."
Fun Fun Fun,"This area is just plain fun. During the day it's alright. When the sun goes down, this place turns into an adventure and is where the 'hyper' title is earned. More street food vendors come out and the place is packed. There's tons of food options (aside from the street food - we pleasantly enjoyed the restaurant the 'Red Sun'). Wife had a blast window shopping, and got a killer deal on a awesome winter jacket and scarf. This being my wife's first time to Korea, she frequently used the expression ""Shopping in Korea is whole other experience"". Make sure you come here with plenty of Cash, an open mind, and empty stomach and try all the vendors, no matter how scary some of it looks."
Tourist Haven,"Not a criticism, I'm a tourist. Full of Food stalls weekends and evenings. Shopping was 50 percent skin care stores. Lots of energy."
Lots of repeated beauty shops ,For a moment I was very confused if I was indeed walking along the same street or not since most of the beauty / cometic shops brand name are the same. Too many repeats making this place rather boring for me. Was expecting more varieties. 
Visit at night,"Myeongdong comes alive at night, street food line the main streets. Forget your dinner plans and be sure to try every food store. Prices are quite reasonable with most clothing shops."
"Not so hyper and..not ""so"" shopping","It is indeed an interesint place, where you can see all kinds of people. Most of the things you can check out and maybe buy are average clothes and some souvenirs, which are quite nice and have a reasonable price. The place is full of coffee shops and restaurants, also street foods and snaks for all tastes. Ladies, prepare your money and venture yourself in cosmetics shops and guys...well..you will have to be very patient. "
Extremely crowded with tourist,"During my most recent visit, the place is flooded with tourist from all over the world. It is not very easy to get around as there were human everywhere. I only head down to Myeongdong because of my few favorite brands are there and the stock are always sufficient. Otherwise, I would seek other alternative."
Great shooping area to get in touch with the locals,"My family and I visited this area in the early evening and I would definitely recommend a visit after 6pm. Then the street food stalls will be open and the streets fill up with locals (well, at least Koreans) and mostly Asian tourists. It is a nice neighborhood to go shopping and grab some food."
Wow,"There were so many cosmetic stores selling facial masks that it was amazing to see all the different brands out there. My wife had a good time buying all sorts of cosmetics. Interestingly enough, Korean cosmetics are not as expensive as western counterparts."
a good place to shop with bargain,Myeong Dong is basically a place where you can shop for all sorts of female accessories and cosmetics. Its a place of fashion. Apart from that many branded fake goods are available where anyone can purchase it for a very very cheap price. A well crowded street and looks like a Big funfair going on.Packed from noon till night.at the end of the street has a beautiful Cathedral... known as Myeong dong cathedral. This is where our Pope visited recently when he came over to seoul. Over here you can see or rather feel the presence of holiness as you witness the quiet sactuary underneath the cathedral where the remains of the murdered Matyrs are kept. Really serene and peaceful and you will love this cathedral visit.
For those people who like shopping,"The cab driver saying "" This place is packed with all tourists "" when I am about to get off. And he is absolutely right and I personally don't like it as I came from a city of shopping paradise."
Many things to buy,"My hotel is located in Myeong Dong, every day, we just go to shop and eat snacks there. Expectedly, the food was delicious and we can buy many souvenirs there. I bought some pairs of shoes, some clothes and some seaweed for souvenirs. It was very enjoyable. We also went to a barbecue restaurant there. It was very delicious. I hope I can go there again and can see those friendly people over there."
Shop till you die,OMG. It's an amazing place for shopping and food. Shop till you drop ... it's such a great place to be
Shop till you die,"OMG, it was a fantastic experience. Food along the street with shops open till very late. It's busy but not too crowded. Loving it"
"Shop, shop, shop!","Myeongdong is a shopper's paradise. There is row after row of beauty shops, women's clothing stores, restaurants, cafes, K-pop stores, and did I mention the beauty shops? You can stock up on fantastic Korean skincare and make-up at very reasonable prices, and most beauty shops will give you free samples, even if you don't buy anything! It's a fun, exciting part of Seoul, and I'd highly recommend it."
Mega Fashion Shopping Street,"Tons of things about fashion are here.... cloths, shoes, cosmetics, accessories, restaurants, cafe, etc. Open around 10 am. But night time is better.... colorful and cheerful. Don't forget to bargain to get lower price."
Myeongdong day and night,I have been to Myeongdong during the day but also after dark. During the day it are just the shops that are open. Which is perfect because it is not as busy although some people probably find it busy. Lots of different shops where you will be assisted by nice and helpful employees. At night there is a different world. It is super busy and you can barely move around other then getting back in line and move step by step. A lot of street shops appear which adds a nice charm. Can honestly say it felt like I was home in Amsterdam while walking around there.
Busy never sleep area,The whole complex alley full of energetic Korean teens life circle; Plenty of shopping goods items shops; cosmetic; Brand name logo. Along with local vendor food sell which of course some reasonable price some a bit overrate.
Great shopping atmosphere,"This is a must do every time I'm in Seoul. Masses of locals and tourists looking for bargains, shopping assistants thrusting samples into your hands and dragging you in add to the fun. As night falls the street stalls also roll out which make the whole area even more exciting! Aland is the best shop for fashion - must go!"
Fun Place to Try Korean Street Food and See Lots of K-Stuff.,"There are a lot of souvenir items to buy in this place but of course its frequented by many tourist so the price is also higher if you shop at other places in Seoul. However, if your just looking for a place to experience the korean vibe, spending a day in this place is totally worth it."
Loved it!,"It's quite crowed, but I loved it! So many shops of all possible kinds and prices are okay. "
Feels like you're in China,"There are a lot of Mainland tourists there buying a million mask sheets and other make-up products. The shop representatives look jaded and tired of their jobs; if you don't have to go there, don't go. "
Streets filled with food n merchandise!,Street after street of foods and a variety of goods. A place to visit when visiting Seoul. It reminded us of Mongkok Street and the Ladies Market in Hongkong. Definitely a must when you're in South Korea.
Great Shopping!,"I visit this area pretty frequently just because I love the sights and sounds. It has everything! It's a huge place for cosmetics and facial care, but it also has the big Shinsegae department store within walking distance. I love Myeongdong!"
This place is the bestestestest,"Myeongdong is a shopping paradise yet also a eating heaven with lots to do. There are lots of cosmetic shops, Korean boutique stores and well known brands such as h&m and Zara. You can spend a whole day there or even more. It is easy for you to get lost around the area but there a tourist information guides around to help direct you and give you maps. They are very helpful. Most of the people in the stores can speak English because it is a touristy area. Just make sure when you see an item you like -- buy it. It is difficult to find the same shop! They also set up markets around 4pm onwards which a lot of them sell food. "
3rd Time Here!,"I've been to Korea 3x now but this time I stayed directly in Myeongdong and I wasn't disappointed! Even though I was here for 6 nights I was never bored! Anything your fashionable heart fancies is here! I would highly recommend you check out Level 5 to see some of the wonderful local designers. Korean fashion is sooo much more advanced and stylish. Actually, I have donated all my American branded clothes and strictly wear Asian/Korean branded clothes now. Also, if you want cheap backpacks, you can find them here. The cheapest I found was for 10000 won off the main drag but you can find backpacks all over since Koreans love them. I also highly recommend Lotte Young World to get a quick exposure to the ""Fashion House"" concept of retail. In this concept, you will find many, many individual fashion (local brands, mass market, independent) retailers in one area. I'd dare say the amount of fashion I see in one of these buildings surpasses the sorry selection I see in downtown SF. Trust me - after experiencing shopping in Korea, you'll see stateside shopping as small time and borinnnng. I don't buy fashion anymore in the U.S. I save my money and head to Korea "
Shoppers Paradise,There are so many stops and the visitor center is very helpful. There are a lot of places to stop so you need to have a game plan. 
Spectacles,"It's really a shopping paradise for cosmetics and clothes lovers but for me it's only ok. If you want to buy spectacles don't buy there ,buy at the underground mall instead I got ripped off saying my frames was 40,000 won and with the glasses it cost me 90,000 won. Ater that i went to the underground shopping mall saw the same one that only cost 10,000 won!!!i was so angry , so be careful!"
So good!,"This mall gave you a lot of DIY and great Korean updated fashion. And guess what, it opens untill 12am (my tour guide said usually it opens until 1am during summer). The price is good considering the quality of the stuff you're going to see here. Most of the shop keeper is insufficient in english, but that was fine since they will simply understand gesture and provided calculator to show you therice when converted to US$"
crowded but,"Too many people, too crowded! Many places to shop and eat. Avoid Korean national holidays or weekends as more people will be there.There are many street vendors and the prices of the items they sell are reasonable. "
The city that does not sleep (for Korea),"Like New York's Time Square, Myeongdong is very lively at night in view of the lighting of the tall buildings and lighted up billboards. There are a few street hawkers around offering bbq octopus and other stuff. The giant departmental store and the eateries give you plenty of choices 'what else to do'. You can also sit and watch people if it is not a very wintry nite.As I have a limited budget I went down the underground shopping center and found a food court for cheap eats. Beside this there are also some fast food Korean eatery across the road (access under ground pass).Maybe they can make a movie ""Sleepless in Myeongdong' without a need to hire cast of thousands of extra. Have fun eating and shopping !"
Extreme Disgust,"I've decided to write about this after much thought. I have to say that the shopping experience is overwhelmingly extreme disappointment. If you plan to shop here, I'll advice you: don't! Just go to the airport Duty Free (the Shilla); they just opened a new counter. I've gone through the pricing, it's definitely cheaper! And you won't get the bad experience I had with the shop. Unlike anything I experience with Korean culture, the shop assistant adopts a mainland China sales approach: push and hard sales. Meaning: non stop statements telling you should buy something, while keep adding products (yes, they take the items and shove it to you) into your hands / basket. What makes it unbearable: she tells you it's star products that everybody keeps coming back to get more (which is why it's in bulk), and that its a hassle and a problem that you made her retrieve only one bottle for you. The exact experience I had, and the words I was told: 1. You're from xxx country, you guys are rich and able to afford more! 2. People from your country always come and get this in bulk; it's very cheap to them and you should buy it! 3. Don't worry if it's suitable to your skin; all those who tried all come back for more, why not buy in bulk now and save you the hassle? 4. Trust me, the price is really good! Now that we have such promotions, and you'll get tax refund on top of that! And I'll give you some free sample as well! All the cheap tactics that I'll only get when I was in YaXiu (China) wholesale market. Only sole purpose is to made you buy and spend unnecessarily more to satisfy their sales target.Of so many shopping trips I had, this is the first surprisingly awful experience I ever encounter in Seoul. I need to ask: what happened to the old virtue Koreans are so proud of? This is as if I'm shopping in China (no offense). But then again, every time I'm went China for shopping, they don't even dare using such cheap tactics on me. I have to say this again: it's an extremely disappointing experience. Do not shop here! You can get your stuff in the Incheon Airport duty free. "
Myeongdong - skincare and cosmetic paradise,You'll find tons of local brand stores here! Exit 6 of Myeongdong Station gets you the entrance of the shopping streets. Lotsa of restaurants in the area too. A great place to spend the day here!
If you only have time for 1 place.... go to Myeondong,"Myeongdong is home to many restaurants and stores, even O'Sulloc store from Jeju island is represented here. Abundance of street food and stalls selling caps and facial products.Money changers here do not offer good rates."
Lively place,lots of food. Shopping and you can reach it using Metro. The underground metro shopping is also good. 
Shopping latest cosmetic trends,"I went there on June, 2014. There are many cosmetic shops that went on sale!! love it. Must go!! Clothings and stationaries are also available. Across the road, there are Lotte mall and Shinsegae which have many brands, also supermarket that sold food"
Shopping freak,"I could go to this place everyday for eating, shopping, movies, just walking around. It got crammed during weekend. Love the street food here."
Crazy Shopping!,"We went there during the Korea Grand Sale so the prices were slash with big discounts. They also give free samples. At night, there are lots of street food you can try.The Korea Grand Sale usually happens during winter Dec-Feb so if you plan to do lots of shopping, go to Seoul during this time."
TONS of skin care shops,"One of the things you must do in Seoul is definitely shopping. Myeongdong handles that perfectly. You'll find streets food, restaurants, snacks, gazillion tons of skin care shops (really mean it, you'll have Nature's republic in every street literally). There's also a big MCM shop here. You'll have no trouble finding for food here and don't bother to turn back to look for that shop that you've missed, especially if it is a skin care shops as you'll find exactly the same shop the next street. Most of the shops have some workers that could speak some Mandarin and English."
Must try roast squid!!,"I went to Myeonhdong to shopping with my cousin. All things were attractive us. We have planned to buy only skincare and cosmetic. But now if we go back,it will be not for skincare and cosmetic we will go for street food. It is fantastic you should try roast squid and something like strawberry in mochi."
Good for shopping and cosmetics. No cultural experiences here though. ,"This place has a large number of cosmetics stores and clothes shops, as well as foreign clothing stores like H&M. Although it is very touristy and the sellers over charge you for street food and are pretty rude. If you like branded stuff this is your place. "
Fun cultural outing!,"I went down to Myeongdong with a colleague one evening while in Seoul. The shopping environment was certainly high-energy! There were skin-care shops and other shops galore, and the pedestrian-only walkways had many interesting kiosks down the middle, peddling anything from socks to street food. Good fun!"
time n patience needed,Streets of various products can be found in this super shoppibg street...all is needed is time and pkenty if walking. .cosmetics streets is craxy for ladies with pkenty of stores offering value masks at 1 for 1...plenty of eateries n coffee cafes as well. ..
Great if all you want is clothes and cosmetics.,I am not usually the clothes shopping type. I usually look for unique things to by in markets. Myeongdong however was great for my wife who loves clothes. There are a lot of cosmetic shopping too. 
Skin care/ cosmetics HEAVEN!!!!,"love it love it love it. love the free samples too. I bought a lot to get the free samples tho. They don't really speak english very well so usually when they give you samples they talk to you but once you start responding back in english they back off. If you understand mandarin, don't let them know, the sales people can get pretty annoying. other than that skin care/ cosmetics heaven!"
"A lot of shopping centres around, but nothing fantastic","Unless you are specifically looking for a particular brand or look, you will probably do better in the markets which will have cheaper stuff that are less commercialised."
Indeed a cosmetics haven,"The cosmetics street in Myeongdong is indeed a haven for getting your buys on cosmetics and skincare products! However, it is very very crowded and please take care of your belongings (we lost a phone here and we couldn't get it back)."
"Great shopping, good food!","Easy to go by taxi, great street shopping, good price and quality. Amazing cosmetics shops in the area, wonderful experience, need more than 3 hours to browse around."
"not just shoppng, also foodies!","Restaurants close as early as 9pm and 12mn is the latest. When they are on sale, they are really cheap- from beauty products to clothing. And also, cat and dog cafes are present in this area. In my case, i love cats so the cat cafe is a heaven place for me. A fee of 8000 won includes a free drink. I love the blueberry latte!Roam around and prepare your shopping basket and be prepared to be hyper.You might visit lotte dept store as well and pay a visit in the cathedral to pray (if you are a catholic). English mass is offered only during sunday at 9am.By the way, if you are going to use credit card to pay for your food, don't hesitate to ask the staff and you might encounter some challenges like what we have encountered (where the staff is not sure if they accept other credit card brand/bank despite of the visa/mastercard/amex/jbc logo on their door."
good designer shops,good designer shops but a total rip off for tourist if you will eat in the stalls outside because it is place for tourist
MyeongDong in Winter - Not just shopping,"This is my repeat visit in winter to MyeongDong, so I manage to observe other attributes offered.Previously, I got too immersed on the multitude of skincare products. This time around, I noted many sports and footwear stores. There is of course Uniqlo as well, and other fashion wear, but I think beyond shopping, you can enjoy the many local food stuff being offered.By evening, many more mobile stalls will be set up. There can be fried foods, toeppoki and fishcakes, bbq chicken, and blood sausages, etc... Also, there is ice cream on a curled cone, brown candy, potato noodles, bearded candy, dough fritters, fries, I even saw someone selling steamed lobsters and crabs. Many more I cannot remember.Myeongdong is a good place to absorb the foods and shopping enjoyed by both tourists and locals. Lots of seated eateries as well.... TIP : It can get really cold.... but you can always pop into their underground shopping area for non-stop food and shopping. Enjoy !"
So many people and stores!!!,This has some incredible shopping! Lots of western stores and street vendors!!! I love buying cheap costume jewelry here. There is also some good street food.But--it is crowded. Like sooooooooooo crowded. So come prepared.
Cosmetics island,"Many stores selling cosemtics there. Most people there knows how to speak chinese as there were many chinese tourists there. Most stores have the orange tax free label. Do ask their staff to issue you with a tax refund receipt when you purchase goods above 30,000 krw.You can show the receipt to Olive young shop level 2, orange tax refund area, which is beside royal hotel. Or you can do it at the airport. You can refund back about 10percent tax. There is a M plaza where seoul tourism board is. You can try those korean costumes , and also use free wifi there. For currency exchange, can go near the chinese embassy to change. The rate is at least 2000krw more if you change 100sgd . You have to find it"
so much fun!,"Music blaring, lots of cosmetic shops, socks, trendy fashion, lots of street food vendors but clean and safe. It was snowing and freezing but hundreds of people walking, eating, and enjoying the carnival atmosphere "
Korean Cosmetics Heaven,"I think the first thing that comes to mind when in central Myeongdong, especially on the evenings, is that it is almost always crowded. It's a good mix of locals and foreigners here, but I could really do with fewer Chinese tourists shoving people around and screaming for each other. If you want a more pleasant shopping experience, my recommendation is to visit this area on weekday afternoons.The second, and this is what inspired the title of this review, is that there is one Korean beauty brand shop every few steps of the way. No stock of a certain brand at a certain shop? Have no fear, there's at least five others of the same brand within a five minute radius! These beauty shops do add quite a bit of life and colour to the Myeongdong streets, as the girls are always trying their best to attract customers with free samples and huge in-store discounts. Again, the aforementioned tourists misbehave here, as they try to stock up on samples without even buying a wad of cotton wool from the shop.The street food here can be pretty good, and my wife and I spent a good number of our nine nights in Seoul indulging in both savoury and sweet Korean treats. Most of the stalls only come up from the late afternoon on weekdays, but on weekends many open from as early as noon. There are also a whole lot of restaurants here, and if you want a quick recommendation I would suggest Yoogane (Korean chain offering chicken dakgalbi), Wangbijib (outstanding Korean barbecue), Mukshidonna (Korean tteokbokki and noodles) and Oppadak (Korean fried chicken). For cafes, we quite enjoyed our time at Red Mango (Korean iced desserts) and one of the cat cafes (yes, drink your coffee and play with the adorable cats!).Apart from shopping and eating, I would also strongly recommend that you catch the Nanta Cooking show, at the Nanta theatre located within the UNESCO building. It's a hilarious non-verbal comedy that's really entertaining. One tip, though, do try to book your tickets online in advance, as the website tends to have generous discounts, and you also get to reserve a good seat for yourself.There's a big Lotte Departmental Store just across the street, and on its top floors are duty-free sections for luxury brands as well as cosmetics and beauty products. Once again, the aforementioned tourists are here in waves, buying up items as though they could eat them in times of famine. I didn't like the shopping experience here one bit. But here's the thing: you could actually get the same products at the main shopping area within the Lotte mall, just that you have to claim taxes at the airport. Claiming taxes is very easy though, there's an efficient service counter on the ground floor, and at the airport it's a very smooth and fuss-free experience. (I guess those tourists running ape mad at the duty free section just have no clue how to fill in the tax claim forms, much less go through the entire claim process; true enough, we saw some immigration officers close to committing suicide in the face of these blur but arrogant tourists.) My wife (well, on my account) spent quite a bit on Korean-based Hera products at the main Lotte cosmetics department, and got a good load of freebies in return - you don't get to enjoy such freebies at the duty free area, lest you spark a stampede. We also noticed that the more mainstream Korean brands at the duty-free area are priced slightly higher than at the Myeongdong stores, largely because the latter have far more discounts applied to the items (can be up to 60% + VAT) compared to the paltry 7% GST.With all that, have fun soaking in the atmosphere and going on a shopping and eating frenzy! :)P/S: Feel free to drop me a note if you need any more information, and I'll see how I can help. There's also a tourist office along the main Myeongdong street if you need help with directions."
Disappointing place,"It was still a great shopping district to visit in 2012. Many different shops and prices were attractive. But nowadays, you can only find beauty shops everywhere in these crowded streets. And you can find same shop selling at same price in other area. Foods, might-be I was the unlucky one, it was disappointing. If you are a first time visitor in Seoul, may-be it’s still worth to spend few hours in Myeong-dong. But if time is limited, I think Seoul has many more interesting places to see or shop."
Crowded,"Loads of shopping - not always at the best prices. If you have no time, this is the place to go, where you have loads of beauty shops, restaurants, etc. Some things are overpriced. "
Shop till you drop,Traversing the shopping district go myeongdong makes you feel as if your time there is never enough to take it all in. The buzz and energy of the place keeps you walking to turn the next corner or to explore the next shop. Great shopping district. 
SHOPPING!!,So much shopping to do here. From high class luxury brands at the department stores to the fun and cheap shopping in the streets. Must go place for tourists.
Great shopping!!,"huge selection of beauty products , great prices....you can try anything you want...you get tons of free samples and gifts with your purchase"
A super crazy and exciting place to go shopping,"I have been here a few times, and mostly just walked up and down the streets. The energy is unbelievable as there are many South Koreans and international visitors walking the crowded streets. There is a beautiful Catholic church nearby, so I recommend visiting that too. All in all, this is a place that any visitor to South Korea should visit."
Great outdoor shopping experience ,"Didn't think it would live up to the hype but it does. Fantastic street food, every ship imaginable and all restaurants accommodating to foreigners. I didn't think it would be like this but it was 10/10"
Cosmetic Streets,"A place to be for lady like for me. I can get every cosmetics, beauty products that I wanted. From every Korean brand there is. ask for sample products, but beware dont be swayed when they say its free. (check before paying, because I almost get cheated. They say its free but they almost charge me).Bargain before buying...like bags and etc from the street vendor. Can get a good price when you know the trick."
Shoppppppp,"The bags were brilliant for shoppers no matter which gender you are. Other than that, facial products will have to be wary since different outlets gives different promotions. some research first might be ideal"
Fav market,So many store and alot of people.. must come here you will confuse where and what to buy.. be prepare you wallet
Shopping heaven with added bonuses,"When people say this is shopping heaven, they are not exaggerating. A small cluster of maybe four or five parallel streets are tightly packed with shops selling all sorts. This range from your usual brand names to independent stores. As expected, the big brand shops are largely the same as anywhere else in the world but my girlfriend took special pleasure with the independent shops. There were places selling anything from costume jewelry, cosmetics, bags and backpacks and anything else in the middle. The independent shops offer very decent prices and my girlfriend found that there was quite a lot of decent merchandise up for grabs. Even though I am not a big shopper, I also found there was some good selection for men's accessories as well.The added bonus is that there are plenty of restaurants and cafes dotted throughout the area and we actually stopped for a couple of hours at one of the dog cafes (which name I can't remember, unfortunately) after desperately looking for a cat cafe. It turned out to be the best of the two dog cafes we visited during our short trip.Probably best to go in the evening to get the full experience and to avoid most of the crowds. Makes for a good evening stroll and the shopping can be taken casually."
Shopping and food haven,"If you want to shop in Seoul, this is the place to gravitate to. Lots of shoppers, lots of shops and for lovers of Korean cosmetics, this is paradise. Somehow, there is a certain vibe about this place that makes it great despite the crowds. There are the familiar brands like Uniqlo, Skechers and Adidas and also hip Korean brands.We also like the street food here like tornado potato and odeng. There are also lots of restaurants here such as the famous Gogung with an artiste playing a traditional Korean musical instrument to entertain us while we eat. Shop and eat and you will enjoy MyeongDong."
Shopping heaven!,Go later in the afternoon to early evening... the area comes alive and is definitely worth a visit! Lots of shopping and good food.
myeongdong too crowded,it was too crowded and there are more Chinese than Korean. Street is filled with people and you have to squeeze in the shop. you better find out other place than MD for shopping
Shop like crazy!!,"If you ever need a place to go crazy, here it is. Huge area with countless of shops for all your needs - beauty shops for all your masks and lotions, clothes, handphone accessories, amazing street foods, theater, restaurants and coffee cafes, bakeries, cute Korean stuffs and much more. Don't forget to check out Daiso for cheap finds and souvenirs. "
Shopping haven,"You probably heard of this place, and indeed there are so many streets of shopping and street food! Things here tend to be cheaper than Singapore (my country), and I LOVE THE STREET FOOD!!!"
Shopping paradise,I like cosmetic a lot... So for me it's like a child goes to candy shop... Everything it's so cheap compare than they sell in my country. Soo it's a must visit for me if i go here again someday 
Shopping haven!!!!!,"Its was really cold in winter therefore wear proper winter clothes especially young children. It does get crowded but being in asia its nothing surprising. Moreover there are lots of variety such as designer brands, local brands and market like stalls. I would recommend a whole day to fully explore the place and the street food there is good and there are heaps of places to eat and have a cuppa. I would recommended anyone who would like to buy pressies to bring home stop by here also."
So many shops so little time,"we love the food carts selling food. Unfortunately we just ate our lunch before we came to Myeongdong but we ended up stuffing our faces as well. There were carts selling little interesting stuff for the children as well. Prices were not so cheap for some of the food, but were pretty standard prices across all shops."
Great place to Visit,Myeongdong has lots of shopping and for beauty products at least 3 or 4 of the same shops. If you head downward there are a tonne of restaruants serving all types of food. But there is nothing better than a good Korean BBQ.
Well prepared for shoppers!,"Most shops have multi-lingual staff. They really cater to foreigners, and Chinese in particular. Makes it way too easy to spend lots! ☺ There is no end of choices for clothes, food and cosmetics in this area."
Myeongdong: Hyper Shopping,"Many shops around here, together with ""the best"" money changers for people who is visiting seoul.Shops include Uniqlo, Tony Molly, Etude House etc... Many street food available which are pretty decent, please try them! Please remember for ask for tax refund if you purchase from those outlets upon spending a certain amount."
Plenty of Shopping - Crowded,"OK, this is mega-shopping so plan for having to wade through crowds. Myeongdong is one of the key shopping areas of Seoul - lots of tourists. Many shops and street vendors selling clothes, cosmetics and of course street food. Cosmetics seemed especially value-priced. There are tons of people at all times of the day, and our Korean friends warned us to be careful of flashing a lot of cash and to keep a close hand on wallets and purses. (Yes, even in Korea, petty theft occurs, especially in the tourist areas...) Parking can be HORRIBLE, so take a taxi or the subway if you can..."
Pretty Shopping Street,"A chance to savour lots of yummy street food whilst shopping along the alleys selling cosmetics, clothes, shoes, accessories and etc. You'll probably find all your favourite brands here. Also many eateries and dessert shops."
The best in shopping in Seoul - Myeongdong!!!,"They say this is the shopping mecca in Seoul and true enough, it really is! We had so much fun here compared to Dongdaemun. The Myeongdong area is a very popular shopping area among young Koreans, mostly women. It has dozens of name-brand stores such as Nike, New Balance, Levis, and others. Despite the extreme winter cold, there were a lot of people in the two times that we went there. This area will get very crowded around lunch time and in the evenings. It is estimated that two million people per day visit Myeongdong and they go here not just for shopping but also for food! This is Seoul's no. 1 shopping district I would say. The heart of Myeongdong is the two main streets that intersect at the center of the block. One begins at Myeongdong Station and the other at Lotte Department Store. The streets are lined cheek-by-jowl with fashion brand stores, cosmetics shops, restaurants, and cafes. From midday when all the shops are open until the late hours of the night when food carts and neon shop signs light up the alleys, the streets of Myeongdong are full of life and buzz from excited shoppers."
"Clean and comfortable ""street"" shopping","Small restos, coffee shops, cosmetic stores, shoes and apparel stores lined up side by side that provide shopping options to locals and tourists alike. Not a place for haggling though since most prices are fixed. "
Very Fun!,Myeongdong is a nice shopping district! There are tons of phenomenal shops and food stands! I highly recommend going here for anything from scarves to cosmetics to banana milk! There is a little street vendor shop that sells carp break and banana milk for super cheap prices. i love it there!! Definitely go here if you get the chance. prices are good and the streets are clean. (:
crowded,"It was not like that i was in Korea, because everyone can speak Chinese in this area. Even though it was convenient for me, i still hope it can keep more traditional Korean style."
Shopping time,"One of the reason for tourist to go to Korea must be to cm bug cosmetics, and this is the place: variety and price. Go and grab many facial mask while they last... The Chinese crowds buy by tons."
unimpressive,better shopping at Shinjuku and Taipei or even singapore. with less pricey tags. Singapore also soeaks English.
LOVE shopping in Myeongdong,"Fantastic shops, easy to navigate and the variety of street food was insane. Loved every minute of it and can't wait to get back. If you get a chance to try the curly potato skin on a stick (with cheese powder) or the super waffles on a stick (they're bigger than your head!), do it! "
Everything you need is here for your convenience,"Myeongdong is a very busy shopping area and the main shopping stretch of Seoul for tourists. Most of the shops are selling clothes, cosmetics and street food though. There are tons of people at all times of the day, and we did find similar items at Ewha University for slightly less, so do consider that option if you are planning to go there anyway. At the same time, make some time to watch NANTA at the NANTA theatre in the middle of the Myeongdong shopping stretch."
Great place for shopping but you need to have time,"In Myeongdong can you find anything for a good price. The South Koreans do really dress in a stylish way. They are all kind of good looking with very nice clothes. You can for sure find those clothes here, some fore only 10000 won (7 USD). This area is a big place so you will need to have plenty of time for your shopping. If you travel to Seoul and you want to buy things then this is the place."
Shopping heaven,Wow !!... I was there at new year's eve.. sooo crowded.Many food streets... stores.. mostly cosmeticsIt's really heaven for those who loves shopping.
Busy Shopping District,"Lots of choices with inside shopping as well as street vendors. Loved the busy shopping district on the streets of Myeongdong. Got a Doctor Fish Pedicure here for about seven dollars, and loved it! Found a small pizza shop that made Bulgogi pizza that was deliscious! Tons of make up/ cosmetics shops to choose from here. This is the skin care jackpot if you like stuff like that. Friendly shop workers - Krispy Kreme doughnut shop and Smoothie King smoothie shop were a big bonus. Bought a nice wool hat from an outside vendor and bought lots of bath fizzes at LUSH. The religious street pushers promoting their beliefs on a loud speaker could have done without, besides that it was great."
A must visit,"Looking for Korean cosmetics?? Name it and you can find them here. Different clothing lines are also here, from Forever 21, H&M, MCM, Cath Kidston to Local Korean designers . And if you feel hungry after shopping , street foods, food chains and authentic Korean restaurants are everywhere. The fact that this area is crowded it's very safe. There are also roving tourist information in the area that are very friendly and helpful.Just few suggestions: 1. Designate smoking area 2. Vehicles should be prohibited to pass during night. 3. Have a uniform or organize colorful unique style/design of push carts /stalls along the streets.Myeongdong: Hyper Shopping is absolutely a must visit in Seoul."
Get ready to spend money!,"I love this shopping center, can find anything! All clothing and accessory shops. There's also western stores like forever 21.My friends and i loved it, at the time we were new to korea and had lack of clothes, but this shopping area made sure we had a new wardrobe, cosmetics, clothes, SHOES everything you could wish for. It has easy access from the train station too."
Place for facial/cosmetic shopping,"The whole place is filled with shops selling cosmetic/facial products. ABC store sells relatively cheap shoes. In the late afternoon, there are many carts that sell interesting street food. "
Beauty heaven,"My goodness, this was indeed heaven for the fashionable. Missha, Tony Moly, Aritaum, FaceShop, The Etude House, Skin Food, Olive Young, Innisfree monopolised this commercial area.Huge signboards 'blared out' their own cosmetics brands and skincare, attracting crowds of prospective customers.It was very obvious that those who patronise these shops were 98% young people. They filled the streets too.Sale was on when we visited, some as much as 50% off.It was very easy to hail a cab as many of them were parked along the kerb of the main road.Good eateries could be found here too; TwoTwo chicken, Myeongdong gyoja, dunkin donuts, etc.It's most certainly a must-visit when you go to Seoul!"
Hectic shopping area,"Well if u like to see a crowd place and love shopping especially cosmetics, then u should come to this place... Its like alleys full of store, mostly cosmetics and clothes... There is also a tourist center where u can have photo with hanbok... Most street sellers are quite nice and very friendly to the tourists... Recommended place!"
Nanta Myeongdong,Loved the Nanta show at this location. Not sure if it's cos we went on a Saturday but there were lots of street stalls in the streets too. Lovely food choices including colourful cotton candy!
simply love this street !,"wonderful shopping street, spoilt for choice and filled with wonderful streetfood along the street too !"
Happy Shopping,"Well, we can get anything in myeongdong. i got the kpop stuff in this area with a very good price :)I bought souvenir for my family in here.Row of the makeup store :)"
A fun place to shop and eat.,There are lots of night market snack food along the small alleys around Myeongdong. Lots of clothing and cosmetic shops along the street. Many restaurants to chose from. Young people and tourists are flooding around the place.
Hyper from shopping !,"Usually the titles of attractions listed on TA don't have a description, but the fact that they list ""Hyper Shopping"" with Myeongdong says it all. You either get a fantastic (hyper) shopping experience from seeing and buying, or you will get 'hyper' or over-excited just from seeing what is available ! Don't worry; you will be brought down-to-earth when you run out of money !!The majority of shops are fashion or cosmetics, with multiple branches of the same store all over Myeongdong. Don't make the mistake of arranging to meet in front of say, Innisfree or Nature Republic - there are at least 4 or 5 outlets just in Myeongdong alone.Get hold of a map of some sort (see picture) to get your orientation and plan your route through the streets to cover the most ground. There are many restaurants and coffee shops all over if you need a break to rest your feet or get warm in winter. Some of the eateries are on the 2nd or 3rd floors, so look up for their signs while walking.Most of the shops are open by 10 to 11 am, and don't close till very late. The street vendors selling snacks are there by lunch. Many of the office workers from the surrounding area also come into Myeongdong for lunch or dinner, so some popular restaurants can get crowded, but it's usually a short wait."
Busy Very Busy,"Very Bustling with shoppers. Caters for all tastes, from cheap to expensive. Good street food including 32cm ice creams in December, yes December."
Shopping mania!,"If you're looking for shopping, this is the place to go!! You will find everything from handmade jewelry and clothes to street food and Korean designer brands. People are friendly and you can easily spend a whole day here. Buy a coffee or two and just walk around - the atmosphere is wonderful!"
Lively,"Large department stores (e.g. Lotte), cafes, restaurants and major retail outlets are all conveniently nestled in the dense area. The place is lively and can get really crowded during weekends."
"Best location for stay in Seoul, South Korea","Stayed in Seoul for 5 days a week ago with friends. We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong Hotel. It is 2 minutes' walk INTO the Myeongdong shopping area, plus you'll find tons of varieties of food along the streets at night where the cars are not allowed to get in. If you want to do a thorough shopping in the area for both fashion and food, I think 5 days are not enough. Of course one would not want to just shop in one location and Dongdaemun is another famous area for shopping. From Myeongdong it would only take you about 10 minutes to get there by taxi and the fare is cheap. Have to mention though most of the taxi drivers don't speak much English, or I should say most of the Koreans don't speak much English with the exception of some hotels and restaurants. You MUST always ask your hotel people to write you in Korean of the address where you wanna go and show it to the taxi driver. Then, you have to really watch how the taxi go showing that you care and pretending that you know the way, otherwise the driver would take you to the wrong direction and you will end up paying at least 20 or 30% more. It happened a few times to my other friends who were taking a different taxi. In my opinion, you need to really know the Korean language in order to get around in Seoul. Their English is a disaster. That could also be why we did not see that many ""foreign"" tourists in the streets. We usually ran into tourists from the Far East, e.g. Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia. Just wanted to stress out here that staying in Myeongdong was our best choice and the Ibis Ambassador is also a very good hotel considering the price and location. Apart from the language barrier, Seoul on the whole is a very interesting city to visit and it is easy to travel on your own."
Cosmetics cosmetics...,"Needless to say, you can get all sort of cosmetic brands here.. Plus all the freebies that comes with it when you purchase from the shop. Nice shopping districts with street food available and also a variety of restaurant to choose from. "
A shopper's haven!,"I love the place and everything about it. Full of good vibes that will make you come back more than once. You'll find cosmetic shops in every nook and cranny selling some of the finest and best cosmetic in Korea. My family and I went there during the weekend and the main street was filled with vendors selling all kinds of delicious street food and one of our favourite was the Strawberry Mochi which was 2500₩ each. Myeongdong is definitely the place to go if you feel the need to spend or even splurge as they have many designer stores. Besides, you can also do your tax refund here as they have a counter inside Woori Bank. And who knows you might even spot one or two Korean artistes around here."
If you love shopping and crowd,"This place is full of energy. Lots of shops, stalls, food and people. Really interesting and bustling. Shop till you drop."
Best Street Shopping ,"Almost every night we are there. This is one of the best street shopping we ever had. Prices range as low as ₩1000 to max. We had Kebab, Pomegranate Juice, Rice Cakes and almost all Korean foods. You definitely cannot give this shopping area a miss whrn im Seoul. "
FOOD and SHOPPING!!,"We really like the feel and energy of this place when we were in Seoul last week that we can here for 2 nights.. haha..Few tips for fellow TA users :-1) Dun come too early.. the street vendors will start setting up their stalls around 3+ when I was there during winter.. the fun comes from shopping @ the street stalls and NOT the shops (my own opinion)2) If you go there, dun forget to visit the M Plaza 5th floor (Seoul Global Culture centre) to wear the hanbok for free and take photos.. go early to book your time slot as no reservation is allowed..3) prices are fixed so no need to waste time trying to bargain with the sellers.. just have fun looking and eating.. haha..4) eat the ""Egg Bun"" and a strawberry thingy wrapped in red bean and mochi skin.. haha... very very nice.. just be careful as it can be very crowded when the street stalls are in full swing..."
Worth a visit,"Lots of shops selling facial products, lots of street food at night. If you are after clothes, try Lotte Young Plaza. Enjoyed noodles and dumplings at Myeongdong Gyoza. Cheap and good."
quintessential Seoul,"A must go to see the typical shopping nightlife in Seoul. Myeongdong isn't a huge area but lots of shopping to do here, small little shops and big brand names. For local labelled cheap clothing, try dongdaemun first before buying from the shops here. Lots of restaurants and cafes in this area too. So many Korean cosmetic shops in this area as well."
Street food & cosmetics!,"I went there on Friday evening & there were many food stalls along the walking street that you can definitely get very full I tried many different kind of food (I seldom buy food at street stalls but the hygiene standard there was good enough), fruit juice & bought strawberries back to hotel.And, there were lots of Korean cosmetic brands at very good price."
"A place to look, shop and eat...","A pedestrian walk area where you can shop to your heart's content, look at all the people, eat anything you want to eat."
Tons of beauty products.. some good shopping + nice cafes to rest,A pretty nice place to walk and shop.There's some really nice street food in this area that deserves a second helping.
Cosmetic shopping and nothing else....,"Stayed in Myeongdong thinking that it was the heart of Seoul and had excellent shopping. I do regret it as there are definitely better places with shopping too. Seoul is like this huge shopping mecca that never ends. Everywhere you go there are shops shops and more shops. No need to stay in this area. The cosmetic stores are everywhere and EVERY SINGLE STORE (in Myeongdong) has Chinese speaking staff. Not a problem if you can speak Chinese and are prepared to throw hundreds upon hundreds of USD or KRW buying up face masks, creams, lotions, perfumes etc. If you are like me, a humble lady wanting only maybe 10 masks, a paltry tube of face cream, a pathetic pot of gel/lotion.... you are going to get a stare and no service. The staff of almost ALL the cosmetic shops tend to ignore you if you are not buying at least 100 face masks. (How many faces do I have anyway?) I gave up after the 4th store gave me almost identical treatment. You are better off scouring the subways or going to Busan or even Honggik for your cosmetic shopping. These shops are everywhere (and I really mean EVERYWHERE) and there is no need to demean yourself by talking to or buying from the shops at Myeongdong. All the other shops I bought from (not Myeongdong ones) gave me so much samples and awesome service! There is no need to shop at Myeongdong. Go maybe to watch the circus performance of other rich ladies dumping loads of cash at the shops. Food is completely overpriced at the bigger shops. Look for tiny hole-in-the wall shops with the ahjummas speaking only Korean. Don't be afraid to point and gesture. Use Google translate. We never ate at those so called popular food places. Just go into the small alleyways and you will get a superb meal at decent prices even at Myeongdong."
"Nice Food, Nice Shopping, Just Niceeee","7 days 6 nights stayed at Myeongdong. In love with the weather (Mid Nov) & enjoyed the shopping. If you can speak mandarin, you shall not worry when you are at there but for english, it's kinda difficult to communicate. Myeongdong is big and crowded of youngsters and it's very convenient to walk around. Seoul is just that ""big"" where you can actually walk around if you have the strength and with the right footwear. Overall the expenses of food is kinda expensive but i think it's value of money because the potion is enough for my husband and i."
Beauty products,"Best for ladies ! items such as beauty products, bags, clothes, food, optician all there. need to come back few times to explore."
"Overpriced food, touristy","A local told me that Myeong-dong more of a strolling destination for locals rather than a place to eat or shop. Tourists, though, love this place because of all the shops and tourist friendly restaurants. I stayed in this area and ate in this area. The food was overpriced (15,000krw for a single bowl of bibimbap!?! 35,000krw for three strips of beef for the grill?!?). The upside is that this neighborhood is very central, well connected by the subway, has decent hotels, and can have some nice crowds and food carts at night before the shops close at around 11pm."
"Great for shopping, especially cosmetics","Myeongdong is one of Seoul's shopping Meccas, maybe the most famous one. It feels European-ish, with its wide pedestrian streets and brand stores (rather than malls with a multitude of stores). It probably has everything you could hope for and then some. If you're interested in cosmetics (that wasn't my case), this might be the best place on Earth for that. However, I'd say that the area lacks lasting impression and soul. Architecturally and stylistically, Gangnam is more impressive. It also doesn't have a great nightlife nor many great restaurants. Finally, Myeongdong, although great for shopping, doesn't offer the same mix of authenticity, cultural significance, or architectural attraction as many of the areas around it. Clockwise: Insadong (great for traditional cultural experience), Dongdaemun (also great for shopping, but offers both a traditional market and the brand new DDP), Sogongdong (with the Seoul City Hall and the DeokSuGoong Palace, the true heart of the city), Jongno (skyscrapers, CheongGyeCheong, GwangHwaMun). So, if you like shopping, definitely go to MyeongDong, but in any case, don't miss all the districts surrounding MyeongDong that may be even more interesting."
Great shopping area ,"Great shopping district in Seoul , easy to get there by subway from Seoul central . The area is divided in separate sections of cloths , footwear , food so make sure you have a look at map . Market is active on night or evenings . So make sure you go there in afternoon . Good fun time and great shopping area "
Heaven Is Here,"i love going to myeongdong, there so many cosmetic shop and delicious food. and you can shopping all around the time here. you must give space to long time here. becuse if you just going one or two hours here you get nothing. kkkkk"
Shop till you drop,Best place for female shoppers only. Sorry guys. Price is reasonable than Dongdaemun as the latter marked up the price high and has to bargain at least 40% down.
Good place to get souvenirs,Weather is very cold during this period and this does helps us to get in to most shops to get some warm air and also buy some souvenirs home.
Seriously flooded with people in the summer!!!,"I went here early summer 2014 to get some last minute shopping done and it was cray2!! I just didnt expecy to see this amoun rlt of ppl after my China trip. The streets were jam packed with people. I thought I beat yg he tourist crowd by going in May but you just don't beat any crowd when you go here!! But anyway, it was a bit shocking but I took this part as a great experience.Be careful while shopping. Some of the sales ppl are quite forceful so you might break your wallet! I was prepared to only spend $200ish but ended up spending $500... it was of course my decision but they are seriously selling machines on steroid!! Anyway I'm quite satisfied with the quality of the products. I just expect stuff to be cheaper over there from what I've heard but they sell at the same price and they didn't particularly give me more samples than other stores would. So I was a bit bummed about that...So I saw a lot of cafes and some BBQ Restaurants. They looked l Iike the hip place to be but since I was so hot and tired and ran out of time I didn't get to try them :(Instead, I went to this hole in the ground restaurant lol. I wanted to try they're cold nangmyun that was advertised outside. The restaurant was great, I saw a lot of locals inside. Tho i was stared at, prolly for being the only girl who eats lunch alone. The nangmyun was super delicious. It was perfect for summer! I can't remember the name of the restaurant, sorry. Hope you guys go and have a great time!!"
Great shopping place central Seoul,"Nice shops, many young people, best at night, street food, everything, located central Seoul, a must visit place in Seoul."
"Great Shopping, but Better Elsewhere","Myeongdong is indeed shopping haven for the ladies, theres streets and streets of shops selling beauty and cosmetics. They'd give you little freebies just as you enter the shop, and if you do purchase some items, they'd throw in even more freebies.The staff of these shops are rather aggressive in getting you to enter their shop, and it can be rather intimidating. They have a tendency to follow you around and make you try the testers of products, which can put some people off (it definitely did me!).I did find though that these beauty shops in other areas are cheaper and offer more promotions than the ones at Myeongdong. Even on the same day, in the same shop but a different branch. I did most of my shopping at Edae area (Ehwa Womens University), and I found them to be less intimidating, more informative and much cheaper. They also gave more freebies!The crowd at Myeongdong is a bit putting off, not even in the shops, but on the streets as well. And people there tend to shove, which put me in an awful mood after a while. All in all, I'd probably do all my further shopping elsewhere."
shopping paradise,everything you want is lies here in front of your eyes.. food.. make up.. fashion.. everything.. I went here almost everyday and miss this place so much..
All you wanna buy in seoul,"This street has all of it, whatever you wanna buy, you name it. Cosmetics, souvenir, snacks, clothes, bags, everything... So if you want to buy something, I went to EDAE shopping street before I go to myeongdong street, and you can find what you buy in EDAE shooping street, in this area too."
From street stall to high end shops,Great varieties of souvenirs to choose from. Not a place for good bargaining as their prices r relatively fix. Very crowded especially at night.
Excellent shopping area,This is a really great area particularly for the tourist who is wanting to buy gifts to take home. The shopping at day and night is extensive with the shops and stalls who have a great variety of goods to purchase. There are many excellent restaurants selling both korean and with European food which is always of a high quality. For those wishing to buy cosmetics you will be spoilt for choice.Area is very handy to Hotels and is central to transport etc.
Vibrant Night Shopping,"It is located in the center of the city, full of international mid-range brands' shops, as well as local brands, small shops, cafes, restaurants. It is surrounded a by large and small hotels, a big shopping mall which filled with international luxury brands, too. It's a little bit noisy with loud music coming from the shops but it is also, vibrant, lively, bright and safe with beauty parlors, cosmetic depots, large cafes, open air restaurants, the street vendors, food sellers in the middle of the streets. It is very popular and fun to visit at nights but quieter during the day. Conveniently located, close to 3 metro stations, well organized, very safe, no disturbing traffic between the main shopping streets, this place is the mecca for shopping savvy."
Shop till you drop,"It's the lady' s heaven, u can find all the korea brand skincare in this area. The price although same with duty free from Lotte world or airport. But u can get more free skin care sample, tax refund and get buy one free one in Black Friday (I'm lucky).There are varieties of Street food . Restaurants..Highly recommended shopping area."
Best shopping and currency exchange location!,"You get to buy almost everything you need from here. Many eating places here as well. Most importantly, you get the most currency exchange stalls here and also the best rate (get a few quotes)! "
Great Shopping,All the cosmetic shopping in one place. Should go at night to experience the environment. Lots of food stores along the street. Must try the 32cm high ice cream and their baked egg cakes. 
For hardcore shoppers,"The dedicated shopper would want to spend a couple of days exploring this area; it's huge. Besides the big name stores, there are dozens of smaller stores selling a wide variety of goods and innumerable restaurants and cafes that cater to a wide variety of tastes and budgets. Food stalls are not as numerous as in other places but they are there and can be found, usually at the entrances to the main shopping streets.Do look beyond the ground floor as there are many shops and eateries on the upper levels too.Myeongdong is easily accessible by subway and bus and there are usually multilingual guides, recognisable in their red jackets, at major intersections."
Lively Myeondeong,"U ll never b disappointed by Myeondeong - a bustling day n night shopping open air bazaar w endless Korean restaurants t satisfy yr palates. For ladies u wish u hv more time as u zoom in n out o all t wonderful cosmetics houses competing w one another w discounts n samples n u r spoilt for choice - u only worry o yr overweight baggage n bursting yr shopping budget! For only 1,000 K won u get a fresh face mask u can even mask yr face daily! There r a few departmental stores besides t individual stores.

Even t stall carts have varied servings o toppoki t fish cake hot piping soup which u can hv refill o soup to blood sausages r sold ard 1,000 K won. All these r cheaper around 600 won when u r away fm Myeondeong - t tourist haven."
very bad manner of the sales along the street,"they insist to give your samples. when you take the one, they will grap your hands and pull to their shops. when you refuse to go inside, they will get back your samples in a very rude mannner :("
Over hyped shopping place,"Personally find this overhyped. Perhaps because I've been there a couple of times. If you want the typical face shop and other korean masks etc, you may find it very interesting. However, the sales people are mainly Chinese, rather than Koreans. They are at times over pushy as well. This makes the shopping experience less than desirable. I ended up eating, more than shopping."
Great,This place is definitely a great place to shop and visit especially for Foreigners and Expats. I recommend a trip here for people visiting Seoul. 
Another shopping area,"Shopping, lots of it and street food along the way. Good for a quick stop and browse, but not a destination on its own. At least not for a family with kids."
Shopping Haven!!,Lots of clothing and beauty bargains! You can spend hours just roaming to the different malls/ street. Must visit at least once.
happenning...,"wow..!! verry happening place... that place never sleep.... lot of foods, clothes , fashion and everything...... "
Amazing and Amazing,"You will go mad at this place, Top brands and local brands every where. the street is full of all types of shopping. Cosmetics, Clothing, Bags, Eating Outlet. You name it they have it. 101% recommended if you are going to seoul. "
Crowded with plenty of retail shops,"This is a compact area with a lot of restaurants and retail. We were disappointed by slim pickings of local brands, though there are a few. Its a good place to buy that winter coat if you showed up without one heavy enough for Seoul's bitter winter nights. Great restaurant selections. More Mandarin speakers than english though. The roaming tourist info people were really nice. "
It's a great way to see the Korean way of night market with the street food and great finds at the night market,"Experiencing Seoul, Korea is an exciting adventure. It's should be between Hongkong and Japan. A mix of both countries I can say."
Many useless junk,really nothing to see here unless you are coming from a 3rd world country. Prices are high and you can find everything in other shopping malls.
Cosmetics & Skin Care Beauty Worlds,"Tons of famous beauty store located in this Myeong Dong Street, a must for all ages,ladies and women to visit here to get all your daily essential needs or getting as a gift for friends and relatives.Price are good when some stores have a special promotion at 50 % off with freebies."
Shop till you drop,"I really enjoyed coming to this place. The shops are close together, street food experience is up close and you can find lots of cool stuff. The place is crowded most specially at night but it won't stop you from shopping! :) lots of cosmetics and most of the sales clerks can speak English! Yes! must visit! "
shop until you drop,cheaper CDs than in home country. get cheaper korean apparels. loved the green tea at Suloc myeongdong.
A very nice shopping destination!,"This is a very nice shopping area, it has everything. From signature items to the ones locally produced. There are also eateries around and it's nice to walk around and window shop. "
Shoping Street Experience,"Glad to be in here, very amazing street with various fashion attribute ... The price is quite expensive rather than at hongik university area... many food around this area, enjoying my holiday trip in seoul"
Comes to Life at Night,"Likes - All the things you need, this place has it... most in discounted prices! And lots of free goodies if you ever you buy an item. Hell yeah! What you need are keen eyes (to look for great stuff), patience (mandatory) and lots of stamina (to search the whole area for best finds). Most saleslady speaks good English, so don't worry. As they say, seekers are always rewarded! For tax-free items, Lotte Mall is the name. For items with lots of goodies (especially cosmetics and other beauty products), you can find it anywhere in the vicinity.Dislikes - Never go on a weekend, else you'd break a leg or two (from the crowd!) Most locals go here on weekends, so please beg off. Weekdays are more forgiving, if you get my drift."
everything shop & eats,"this is a market with everything to offer and lot of eateries from various cuisinesif non veg. try pork cutlets and not miss the thick noodles,and for ladies a lot of cosmetics available"
Shopping for the ladies,"If you are looking for cosmetics, here's the place to start. Most shops will offer fantastic discounts and have staff that speak Mandarin. For boys, there are shops that offer clothes and shoes that offer a a good range."
Shop till ya Drop,So many many shops both in Lottemart but also in the streets around. Cool cafés and restaurants and ramen shops. 
So many shops,"So many shops to see... So many were the same. Skincare, shoes, souveniers. We were there at the end of the night. It was really busy, still. I enjoyed the browsing but I was really tired. I should have some earlier in the day when I had more energy. I did buy some slug/snail cream. It's all the rage! "
"fYou name it they have it, from Shopping to filling your stomach","From all brands of famous Korean brand cosmetic (Face shop, Nature Republic, Etude House etc.) to Variety of Street food and restaurantVisit the SM town stars and Lotte World Plaza where you can find almost anything from Kimchi to Pork Knuckle to Souvenir for the Korean stars are found hereMuch more interesting than Dongdemun. This is also where the locals go to not just touristOne day Is not enough to complete your visit.A must go location for Seoul"
Ladies Heaven,"So many skincare and makeup shop in here! And most of them will offer discount to tourist. You can find a full set of skincare or makeup products in this heaven! Besides beauty products, this place also has many hidden restaurants which is with cheap price but taste not bad. We spent a lot in this little area! Worth to go!!"
to crowed,"the prices is no t great , ad a lot of chaos in the street if you look for bargains go to the out let in the digital complex "
Beauty Street,"This is the first time I went Myeongdong and before that, I heard alot of people commenting that it is known for cosmetic street. You just need to throw a bomb and it can easily hit a cosmetic shop. It is indeed true when I went to see it myself. And to my surprise, the salesgirls inside the shop are speaking mandarin. For once, I thought I was in China and it just seemed the street was catering for mainland china. So if you are a Chinese, do not need to worry about communication breakdown at all. You can easily find Laneige, Skinfood, Innisfree, Tonymoly, Faceshop and Etudehouse everywhere. Comparing to last few years, the shop doesn't really give out a lot of free samples and there is also price increase of the products. For those who are not so keen in free samples might consider going to Lotte Department Store which is just nearby. There is a duty tax free at level 8 which is cheaper than those shops selling at Myeongdong. You can also find international brands at this level. But please bear in mind that it is very packed with people so do know what you want to get to save time."
Best place to shop,"This is a great place to shop. They had everything! You can get makeup, clothes, food, basically everything you could ask for. I came here during the weekday and it was crowded, but it was even more crowded on the weekend. You truly feel like you're in the middle of all the action. It's a great place to shop or people watch."
Vibrant shopping scene,"Skincare products/ clothing shopping & even Daiso is there/ ton of restaurants, eateries/ cafe & snack stall by the road side for you to chose from. Enjoy your shopping and embrace this vibrant part of the city. "
Fashion streets,Variety choices of shops... and human everywhere. Too crowded specially at late night. This market become the centre of attraction because everything can be found here. All you need is to walk around and explore. You might get lost but its ok. Its a fun experience.
Excellent Place,"Personally I think shopping is not cheep in Korea, yet the products you buy are genuine. Have not see so many cosmetic stores,,,they exist because korean women's buying the products, bit difficult if you really don't know what product is and if is going to be suitable for you. If you toll you might have difficulty to get the right size,,, Yet enjoyable experience"
Thank heavens I have the restraint,"Koreans know how to shop. And I don't think they ever drop. Amazing selections from clothes to random wares, you name it. And it's conveniently located at the base of Seoul Tower so after you go walk around as a tourist, walk around as a shopper! Problem is that most Koreans still don't know how to speak English so the sale usually involves a lot of nodding. Thank heavens I have restraint because I wanted to buy a lot of souvenirs!"
OMG,"What a surprise... amazing shopping, street food and crowds! More coffee shops than I have ever seen, but great to relax for awhile and watch the people :-)"
An Attraction in Itself,"I love the vibe here where you can shop and enjoy watching people go by. It offers a little bit of everything, even entertainment like the Nanta Theater, which we actually had the opportunity to go even at last minute notice. Lots of cosmetic shops where you can get the face masks or BB/CC cream as souvenirs to bring home. They offer them in bulk and also provide lots of freebies.Even if you don't intend to shop, it's a great place to walk around and feel the buzz, stop for coffee or just walk around. I love looking at the street stalls serving street food, selling small accessories like socks, etc. Nighttime is probably the best time to go where you can also enjoy the lights."
Shop till you drop,"Responding to the call of freebies and discounts had me shopping my heart out for beauty products, apparel, shoes and accessories! Find where the tourist information center is and then go about shopping wisely. Take note of the Tax Refund Counters for tourists. There are lots of good buys if you take a step back from being overwhelmed by the sales people calling on you."
Myeongdong is the place to be!,Tons of shopping from small boutique shops to names brands as well as restaurants and cafes. It seems you can find just about anything here! I did not see super high end in this area though.
Mecca for Cosmetic Lovers,"Korea is well known for its popular beauty products nowadays. People now not only looking at US or UK products when it comes to beauty products, including skin care products. Once you hit Myeongdong, you will completely lost in that area around that cosmetic shops. It can be a bit overwhelming for first timer (like me). Don't be surprised here you can see 7-8 shops for each brand located in this area. If you are a money spender for beauty products no way you can miss this place when you visit Seoul. The shops here give many promos so you can save money to get more, but mostly for card payment. Here you can find such a well known brand as Etude, The Face Shop, Innisfree, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Too Cool for School, and so on. Be prepared to spend a lot if you just can't hold your urge to shop :)"
"Good place for enjoying shopping, coffee and food!","Well! I enjoyed visiting Myeongdong in late evening. There are many shopping streets, restaurants and coffee shops. Atmosphere is relaxing and local people are friendly. So, I recommend to visit this place when you are in Seoul."
Shopping shopping and more shopping,I only spent about an hour as I already knew what I needed to get. There is a Laneige flagship store there too. The sales people in most of the facial product shops will most definitely throw in extras but you can always ask nicely for more if you spend a lot. Lots of eateries around too although I did not manage to try any.
Myeongdong my favourite shopping haunt,Great variety of stuff to buy Near to Lotte shopping centre Great range of famous local food to try Late night supper possible Easy access to historical sites 
Fun to be in,"You have to go to Myeongdong when in Seoul. It is a fun place to be in. Lots of side streets and little interesting shops around. Lots and lots of cosmetic shops and the usual mass market international brands. There is also a lot of street food at night. I personally did not do much shopping here, other than buying some Korean cosmetics, but I just love the buzz of the area."
Shopaholics Welcome,"If you are looking for big name brand apparel, most often on sale, this is the place. The whole area is filled with anything you could think of to buy, and every street is dotted with food carts selling traditional Korean snacks. If you want a larger Korean meal afterwards to reward your hard work, Myeong-dong suffers no shortage of fantastic options."
Loved it,"Visited it in the evening. From N Seoul tower we descended the hill by foot - to Myeong Dong.Loved it very much, although we didn't do much shopping there (just bought an item in Uniqlo). The streets had many people (but were not overcrowded). Lots of lights. You see many vendors selling local foods, and we tried the Kkultarae (Korean court cake) and loved it - it's especially delicious while still fresh and hot (hot as in temperature, not spicy). The atmosphere was good and happy, and it was really fun to wander around the pedestrian streets.The area is quite flat, so no problems for wheelchairs."
"very exciting area for cosmetics. even they are mass brands, but lots of fun.","There are lots of cosmetic stores and you can enjoy there to seeing very interesting things. also there are lots of rests around and n the night, there are lots of street foods, so you can enjoy eating on the street too."
myeongdong shopping,"myeongdong is one of the best place i have been to in seoul. i think every 10 blocks you will see missha, nature republic, and etude house. also some branded clothes, restaurants, coffee shops.best thing are the street foods. went there at night. place is over whelming for shopping"
You don't have to shop here..,"Myeongdong has a long history. It's been a centre of shopping for Seoulites for years. But by 2000, Japanese started to occupy this area, and in recent few years all the tourists started coming to this area, and now it got to a point where you see more tourists than locals in the area. One of its attraction was that the area is all walk-only streets and cars are not allowed in. But now the downside is that it gets more people to fill the streets than the cars passing by, making it one of the hardest to place in Seoul to walk around. Now, it is a nice shopping district indeed. But that's if you want to hop in Uniqlo, H&M, Zara and all those global fashion brands which are available everywhere else in the world, and by the way cost more than most of other countries. Most shops are also available in many other downtown spots in Seoul, there's not a single unique shop that you can only visit in Myeongdong. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this area so much. You can go once as a tourist attraction, but if you're looking for genuine items you can only get in Korea, I'd look elsewhere. You know almost everywhere in Seoul is extremely crowded but this area is one of the worst. It used to have history, but nothing is special now, except for Myeongdong Cathedral which is the best catholic structure you can see in Korea."
Nice place to wonder,"In our 7 nights stay in Seoul, we went to Myeongdong on drily basis for eating and shopping you can spend a whole day there if you wish but we opted to go for few hours a day and then cross to lotte for more shopping.The street food in myeongdong is very variable and is good value for money.It's an nice place to be even if you are on a short visit"
"cosmetics craze, and you can find the most delicious toppoki","The place is cosmetics heaven. You can get best price of cosmetics and also a bunch of samples, and bonus. You can take pictures with K-Star standing board. it kinda fun. but the nicest thing about this place for me is, I found the nicest toppoki stall in Myeongdong, in front of Etude shop. I think toppoki in this stall is the best."
Interesting to explore,"I found myself coming back to Myeongdong market a few times during my stay in Seoul. The market has sooo many shops with variety of products & food. You can find just about anything there, in cheap price too!Although perhaps if you don't speak the language bargaining could be challenging. Including ordering food at their small restaurants, coz they have the menu in HANGUL writing without pictures. But then again, this could be an interesting experience, which I think worth the try."
Perfect for Shoppaholics,"The best place for shopping for beauty products. Lots of Beauty product stores line up on this area where good deals can be found. I ended up buying a bag-full of cosmetics like the BB and CC Creams, Snail Cream, Cleansing oils, Make up Remover, and a lot more."
went crazy shopping for skincare,lots of things you can buy here with good price. the best thing to shop is definitely the skincare stuffs. most of the shops here are cosmetics n skincare shops!
Shopping,"If you like the hustle and bustle of markets this place is great! There is many different cosmetics and skin care shops, great little alleys filled with awesome eateries with nice cold beer! The sights and smells are really great but if your not into crowds I would stay away! Ive been twice and cant wait to go again"
A shopping paradise for gals,"This is the best shopping street in Seoul (in my opinion)Gals will go crazy :DWhether at day or night, it's really full of people and really crowdedWhen you shop over 30k won, remember ask for the tax free!"
best place to shop and dine,the night market is the best!!!! lots of good food. the cosmetics were on sale and there are free items when you shop.
Shopping,"There are lots of beutiful small streets with everything you want: cosmetics, cloths, shooes, k-pop, Cds and ""Pancoat"" shop with couple cloths. Also there are shops with couple rings. It's interesting place and you can go there by underground to ""Myeong-dong"" or ""Euljiro 1 ga"""
A great shopping district! ,A really great place to visit. Go at night when the lights are on and it will wrote you with its lights and all of ours action. Your senses will tingle.. Smell sight and sound is amazing. 
Good place for shopping,"Myeongdong is an area where malls, shopping center and street food are located. So basically you can find everything there. Cosmetic shops are everywhere with cheap price too, and The street foods are also delicious."
Next to Insadong,"Myeongdong is another shopper's paradise because you can find everything here from clothing,shoes, bags, cosmetics, food items & souvenirs & some stores are open till midnight. Since it's also a tourist attraction, expect crowds of people here,too.Lotte Dept Store & other foreign brands are also here. So you have so many choices if you don't like to go through so many people."
Shopping paradise,"Myeongdong is the place with numerous stores, especially clothing and cosmetics. If you like shopping, you should stay for at least two days. The prices are acceptable and you can find different styles of clothing here. There are also many cosmetics with low price. You can find many famous brands there.Bring lots of money before you come to Myeongdong."
Crowded with people and stalls,"Might be the timing coz the first time I was here, a kpop was having a guerilla performance so the street was quite crowded. I bought a poncho in a stall while im here.. Overall, i love the street coz it is so lively.. but if i were to stay in a hostel around this place, i dont really like it.. "
Should go at least once?,"I have mixed feelings about this area. It is so crowded all the especially with tourists from the world over. That is fun in a way but also makes for congrsted and kinda messy experience. I like going to the large Uniqlo here for t shirts and stuff. Overall it has lots of cosmetics, shoe stores, clothing stores, etc. for a more youthful crowd. And to s of restaurants including the famous Myeongdong Gyoza. "
Never on a weekend afternoon - unless you're people watching!,"Lots of foreign and Korean shops, most selling roughly the same thing, for an under 30 demographic. The foreign shops are the type frequently in Seoul malls (e.g. Zara, H&M, Aldo). Otherwise walk across to Lotte or down the road to Shingsegae department stores. Dining options are limited but getting better and there's plenty of street food if you're feeling brave (& don't count calories). You can wander the side streets for hours, but seriously, on weekend afternoons it is wall-to-wall Koreans and tourists (esp Chinese these days) so while it's kinda fun to experience the crush of people, it's fairly unpleasant if you're actually shopping. Mid-week is better if you're even slightly crowd-averse."
Place for cosmetics and street foods,"You'll find bunch and bunch of cosmetics store there and almost every store offers discount. Even without discount, the prices are quite stimulating for the ladies to start wanting something from the stores.. yes, many of the items are much cheaper than in other countries (than Indonesia, and based on my blogservation on several reviews from shoppers from other countries). Yet, not all items priced lower than on Indonesia's online shop.. what i did was I screen capture the page (with items i plan to buy) from the usual ol store where i usually buy my products and compare it when i'm in the store..Besides cosmetics they also have lots of street foods, but I had no chance to try them much. Another interesting place to visit is Daiso.. it sells many interesting Korean household items at good price.. everything is around 1,000 - 3,000 KRW -- if you're thinking of buying some snacks, this place is quite recommended"
Too much,Far too many people and rinky dink shops selling cheap junk. If you love Huber busy places with little room to move you should love it.
shop til you drop!,"Went there with still 0'C in the city and there are lots of SALE! Lovely to buy cosmetics, lots of cheap, facemasks for pasalubong or for gifts to ladies and winter clothes for the whole family!Bags and sneakers for kids are on sale too at this time - January."
Cosmetics Cosmetics Cosmetics,"You will never find an area with so much cosmetics boutique so this is a must visit. However, it is more cost-effective to purchase at the airport as the airport duty-free has most of the items (it's only tax-refund at Myeongdong so it's not as cheap as the airport)."
Good for shopping,"Definitely the place you should go if you want to shop. You can find several korean clothing brands, and of course loads of korean cosmetic stores. Also easy to find restaurants and very easy to get there cuz im close to the subway station. I think night time is a pleasant period to go there."
Fun and cultural,A lot of fun mixing with the locals and a lot of tourists.very busy with a lot of skin care shops everywhere who try to allure you in by giving you freebies! A lot of fun till very late at night 
Great Atmosphere but not for shopping,"everything here cost twice than real price , all shop owners know that you are tourist so price is double , don't spent your money here just visit and have fun with great atmosphere ."
The night market that spilled onto the street,"Here you can shop for fun, look around while looking for items you like. What is sold here mostly clothes, shoes, piercings and of course food. If you are lucky then you can find the items you like at bargain prices. Watch the temperature, last time I was there the temperature is so cold."
Something Like Orchard Road,"Those who love to shop for cosmetics and fashion, this is the place for you to be. Etude House, Face Shop, Innisfree, etc. are aplenty here in Myeongdong. Only thing is they like to repeat the same shop down the aisle. Overall, it is a good experience for those who love to carry big shopping bags."
Shoppers paradise!,"Such an intense place to go shopping, specially with the underground subway shopping too! You can easily get lost but you'll have the best time finding hidden gems :D"
So many places to shop,"Myeongdong has so much to offer, from shopping to food tripping. I had a great time!!! You can spend all day just in Myeongdong"
Great shopping area for ladieswear,"Great streets full of ladies fashion brands and lots of skin shops. Brands such as teenage weenie, uniqlo, h&m and forever 21 here plus lots of Korean brands!"
Shops only targeting tourists,Pushy sales reps outside the shops. Lack of consistency as stores of the same brands in the same vicinity have different promotions and discounts resulting in different pricing for the same product.
A lot of stuff...,"You can shop just for the fun of it. And watch the lively night market. For serious shopping, there are other places, e.g. Yongsan, where you find arguably the largest camera and electronic shop in the entire world. "
Shopping till drop,I do not really like getting Cosmetics at Myeondong but I love their local brands and designers there!
Myungdong-central area of tourism,"This area, mostly famous town for tour, is the combination of shopping, accomodation and eatery.Also cluster of tourism in old twon stars from here-Insadong, Samchongdont and namdeamoon. Working in near office for 20 years, I have come to visit this place for shopping. Nice place for the local too."
good facilities to shop,Good place to shop and walk around - depends on what you really want but big malls are just behind the corner - choice is there - friendly people - English knowledge is weak
Full of action,"for guys who don't think there is much excitement in makeup shopping and other crap women buy....may I suggest to 'gain some points' and pretend to suffer along. Excellent coffee shops, great street food and lots of action to keep you busy while your better halves and money over hand and fist. Great afternoon carrying g bags, eating street food and people watching"
Fun place to shop and sample food cart snacks,"You can get lost in the crowds. There are many stores, carts, restaurants and food carts. Bargains to be had if you carefully peruse merchandise carts."
Shop till you drop,"Numerous fashion and cosmetic shops, Lotte, Avenuel, Shinsegae and Migliore! A day spent in this area is not enough!"
Cosmetic heaven,"Lots of cosmetics to buy, so many people, so much street food. Interesting. There were a lot of mask going for 1-1. Buy one and get one free. There were a lot of tourist there. We tried the sweet potato fries (3000 won), coal grilled octopus/squid (6000 won), mandoo (10 for 8000 won), ho-tteok (sweet yeast flour with brown sugar with sunflower seeds and pine nuts, 1000-2000won, sweet egg bread (1000 won), nutella crepe (3000 won). We didn't need to have dinner at all!"
Street vendors are great,This area has lots of shops and street vendors. I personally prefer street vendors because you can find the shops everywhere. But street vendors are authentic and exotic. Also don't forget to buy some street food there
Shoppingggg,"a neighborhood with shopping, food, extremely interesting place,and where you get great shopping))H&M ,Zara, Mango, Forever 21 , ABC-mart, etc"
Great place to hang out at night!,"After hearing so much about it, I was excited to indulge in Myeoungdong. I took the subway and followed the exits to the Shopping arcades and from the get-go, you are flooded with bright lights, and lines of fashion and cosmetic stores!Most cosmetic stores offer you a free face mask or sample to try when you walk in the door, even if you don’t buy anything! However most stores, once you enter, a sales assistant will follow you around trying to get you to buy stuff, which may be slightly annoying for some people. I enjoyed shopping at MISSHA, Nature Republic and Etude House, which have several stores in the area down different shopping alleys. Apart from shopping, I also loved the street markets which sold all different kinds of yummy street food for very cheap prices! I tried a 3000KW ($3) chicken kebab with cabbage and wasabi, meatballs on a stick, corn on the cob (not the best though), and a $1 burnt sugar sweet pancake which was surprisingly good.If you like this type of activity there is also a Café Café and Dog Café in the area and if you visit both, you get 50% of the second café! Just look out for the guys dressed as cats and dogs around the main street handing out flyers.I loved this place so much I came here two nights in a row to shop and sample some of the best street food I’ve had in a while! For guys, the endless amount of cosmetic stores may be a bit too much ;) Definitely come after 5pm, when the street food stalls come alive and the stores are open till 10pm!"
Fun to go,"A lot of good stuff could be found here, socks, cosmetics... Street food is also found here and could feed you for dinner but I've found them a bit greasy to me.Shop along street is also good, sometimes you could find a good quality coat at H&M for only $39,000 won. Good place to go at night."
Great Shopping District,"This is certainly the place to go for shopping in Seoul. Streets of popular brand stores H& M etc. Love the mix of shops and you do not have to go far for a coffee shop, and they are not Starbucks thank goodness. Just Loved the buzz and the people. Busy both day & Night."
shop til you drop,"A lot of great stuffs to buy, Not sure if it's affordable than any other, but they have cool and great stuffs displayed. Didn't shop that much bec. the place is so crowded."
Perfect zone for shopping passion,"Here is Well-known area for shopping specially for clothes, shoes and cosmetics. Oh and lots of cafe are located at the streets. And it was close as Seoul N towel."
Busy still but more Asian tourists,"Great choice, hot fashions and always good for people watching. The only negative is that some chains have several of the same stores. Certainly more beauty shops and coffee shops per square meter than anywhere else in the world plus the new fashion Green Tea shops"
All the Comestics Brands are here,"You can literally find all the comestics brand in Korea along this street. Across the different alley, you will get to see repeated same cosmetics brand. There are also nice cafe for you to stop by and have a slip if you are tired from the shopping and walking."
Shopping heaven!,"WHEW! This place is the spot to be if you want a one stop shop. Myeongdong is more ""high end"" then the other local areas such as Dong Dae Moon and Nam Dae Moon. There are literally hundreds of vendors in one city block that's screaming at you as you walk by for your business. From Western stores such as Nike and Addidas to local Korean shops such as Faceshop, this area is bustling with activity at all hours of the day. At night, the streets are packed with local vendors selling anything from socks, to knock off purses, to electronic equipment. Not to mention all of the glorious street food that you can get for just a few dollars. If your in the mood for some high end luxury department store style shopping, make sure you check out Lotte and Shinsaegae - which closes around 8pm vs. the other stores which seem to be open at all hours of the night. These department stores reminds you of a Bloomingdales/Neiman Marcus and carries high end American and Korean brands as well. If you do stop by Lotte, make sure you check out the food court for endless rows of yummy goodness to eat!"
Night shopping the best!,"This place transforms at night into the most fun, hip place around with street food on steroids! Crowds of people teeming around interesting carts of unusual foods. Everyone having fun."
Myeungdong Shopping,"Liked: Many eclectic small shops, mostly clothing and cafes.Disliked: Gutter sewage smell coming from under ground sewage piping."
a must visit for a shopaholic,"for the Shopping fanatic or we call it ""shopaholic"" you should visit this place, they have this ""buy 1 bundle and get another bundle"" and there's a lot to choose from, they will give you lots freebies also."
exciting; very alive,WOW! myeongdong! it's very electric here! one will get very excited with the shops and the peeps roaming around. approach the tourist info officer and get a map or just roam the streets and alleys and enjoy! buy from beauty stores and get lots of freebies
A famous shopping street in Seoul,"If you would like to buy any korea cosmestic brands, just go to Myeongdong and you can get it. Don't forget to try a local restaurant nearby Myeongdong. It's very good taste but a little bit expensive. "
"Exciting shopping, but not cheaper than usual","Myeongdong is a must-visit stop in Seoul. Your adventure starts once you step out of the metro, as the small shops in the underground metro station are already enough to get you stuck in Myeongdong for more than 1 hour. Be sure to plan your time and budget as there are simply too many shops and everything looks good. Don't get lost here!"
No language barrier,"Most of the sellers speaks english or chinese, some is japanese.There is almost hassling, the competition between one shop and another is so fierce, so some sellers practically drag you into their shop. Too bad."
Bright and shiny best visited at night...,Also you better bring a gps with so as not to get lost walking in circles.... Found my nongshim socks for some friends in Australia here!...
A great place to find bargains and gifts,"This area is crowded with street vendors, stores and high-end stores. A great place to look for gifts for family and friends."
Great but noisy ,"Great shopping, but the place is crowded and noisy. However lots of choises especially for young people. There are shopping malls both over and under the ground. "
Love Love Love Myeongdong!!,"One of the busiest street for Korean style street life.Its easily accessible to come via subway too. I always get lost in the street with sooo many things to buy... cosmetic... shopping.. fashion.... food... everything.. this is a heaven for the female but definitely not for your man or kids if you are with them. hahah....Food wise is good too.. you get to find stalls or even restaurants... this place is very much like the ""Ye Shi"" of Taiwan but on a more high class standard. It can get crowded as it gets darker.. so try to go in the early evening to avoid the crowds."
So crowded!,"It seems everybody who visits Seoul ends up int his place. The streets are lined with shops, most of them selling Korean cosmetics - Faceshop, Tony Moly, Nature Republic, Misha, etc. You find these stores ion every street you go to in the area. The streets are narrow and so crowded. There are also people selling street food and other wares on the streets making ti even more difficult to go around. However, if you want a taste of shopping, this is the go-to place. You will find everything here -clothes, footwear, cosmetics, electronics, etc. The store staff are friendly, speak some English and eager to please (maybe becasue there are just too many stores selling similar stuff!). There are also ample eating places and money exchange shops. The exchange rates are also better here than in other places in the city."
Excellent shopping experience,"You can easily find all Korean beauty products here! And they have more than one shop of its kind. Upon entering they'll give you a free sample, and once you've purchase something they'll give you even more free samples! :D"
My favorite place,"I love this area..you can find everything great restaurant, cosmetic shops, clothes etc... This place is happiness.. not only because i love shopping but its the happiness ive seen in the peoples eyes around here.. everybody is busy.. enjoying.. this is for me a very beautiful view indeed."
Authentic Korean Street Life,When I am in the mood I love to come to Myeongdong for some high-flying fashion and amazing restaurants during the day.. and partying and night clubs in the night. This is one of the best places to see authentic Korean street life. And a must for any visit to the city. I visited here last christmas and will go again this year!
always crowded,"I like this street because they have everything you need for a shopping. Many options and cheap stuff with good quality. what i dislike about this place is it is too crowded it seems this place never sleeps. but, good to visit some time :)"
Must Go in Seoul,"Easy to go via subway. Very crowded, very busy, very festive place. From department stores to supermarkets to small stores to food stalls and restaurants, it seems to be the heart of Seoul shopping."
"Great food, shopping and very busy",Went here for dinner on a Wednesday night and it was alive and bustling like a Saturday night anywhere else.Great atmosphere and array of different shops with little market stalls in the middle. A lot more commercial than other markets but the food on offer is amazing.Recommend any night of the week but most stalls do close up about 11:30pm even on a saturday night. Easy to get to on the train as well.
Hustle and Bustle.,"If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of busy street life then, this is the area to visit. Lots and lots of shops ( open until late ! ) but no top end shops. Many restaurants, street food and an evening market. An interesting place to have a walk but not my type of place to shop."
Myeongdong is like Kovan MRT Shopping Centre,"Many street stalls like Dongdaemun selling snacks, knick knacks in front of brand name 2-3 storey shops like Face Shop, etc. Nothing truly spectacular except great bargains on facial products and street wear. One special snack - egg in sponge cake."
Heaven!,Looking for Korean make up brand? you come to the right place..or looking for street foods?? yes you are here!! even dinner at one of the restaurants here? you can't be wronged! I love Myeongdong...
shop and eat,"lots of variety for shopping. a special acknowledgment to Davich optical shop where I got my glasses in one hour! good eating, though I'd skip the food stalls on the road as they are mostly fried and bad quality."
Don't like it...,"My daughters and I were in the vicinity of Myeongdong when we went for the NANTA show. It was full of people, roadside stalls that have repeated goods throughout and the many many cosmetic shops which sells the same stuff. And the same brand of cosmetic shop repeats themselves every block and round the corners. Their 50% sticker on their window probably refers to the masks in packs and a few items only in the shops.Anyway, some of the roadside vendors are rude. One of them actually told us ' palli ka ' ( which means quickly go ) with a wave of her hand when we said thank you but we are not taking that pair of jeans. We were only looking at it and asked about the price, not even haggling one bit. My daughter and I couldn't believe our ears! Anyway, the skincare / cosmetics we saw there could be bought elsewhere which is quieter with less people pushing you around with the same discounts too....But I must say that the eateries are in abundance and a wide range of choice."
Shop till you drop!,"Masks, cosmetics and clothings. But beware if you get pulled into shops that sells 100++USD masks, the shop helpers are capable of that! The streets were filled with tourists, majority the Chinese nationals, which made it to the point where most store helpers are able to converse in perfect mandarin, but unfortunately not english ;("
clean and good variety of shops,"great during the day to shop and fun at night also. Nice mixture of local atrist, local handmade shops, local products and a few trendy boutiques, and name brand stores. lots of interesting cafes and eateries to try. there's something for every age and group of people here. "
Shopping Haven,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul because it is a shopping haven. I did not know that there are tons of Korean brands of BB creams! And the most amazing part is, there are lots and lots of sale items. Aside from shopping, there are street foods that are worth trying. Although the place is crowded, it is clean and you will feel safe."
shopping,"You can find everything you want to shop in this area, and its right in the heart of the city. You will find thousands of stalls around in one place. Prices are affordable. "
Great place for shopping and food,"Most of the shops are American and European brands. But we did get to shop at some local Korean places as well. Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from. It gets really crowded and we were not aware that most shops don't open until around 11AM, so don't get there early!"
Great place to shop & eat!,Best go late afternoon or evening as lots of night market stalls.Best place to buy cosmetics n socks! U get lots of free gifts for your cosmetics purchase. Huge varieties of cute socks at cheap price! But I feel Myeodong has somehow lost its 'Korean' charm compared to many years back where there are more Korean style or concepts shops. Am surprise to see Thai foot body massage in this area which don't really blend in. Would be great if it's traditional korean spa! Am sure will be great business. We always wanted to try but don know where to find a good n nice ambience Korean hot spring spa!
Everything you need is here,"Souvenirs, food, facial product, clothes and etc. You name it, they have it here. One of the busiest street Seoul. Must visit place and you can spend at least 4 hours walking around this area. Very lively at night."
Heaven for Shoppers!!,"Myeongdong is a very busy shopping area with lots of tourists all the time. The day and night scene is different. In the evening, you will see many street food hawkers and stores along the streets which make it very interesting. It is a great place to shop for cosmetic, masks and skin care products. You can find all the Korean brands in Myeongdong. Its also a place where you will find many restaurants and cafes. You will be spoilt for choices!!"
THE shopping district of Seoul,"If you want a taste of shopping and street food and the noise of a large, international city then Myeongdong is the place. Clothes, souvenirs, food from shopkeepers who almost all speak English - or enough to sell you something. Still, you do not have to spend money to enjoy walking around this place and soaking it in."
Crazy street shopping,Very crowded with so many beauty shops and cafes. Impossible to imagine making your way through but quite an experience. Not great food from a restaurant point of view other than Din Tai Fung but great street food and fantastic people watching.
Awesome shopping and experience,"At first it's quite overwhelming with the volume of people, shops, street vendors, etc. We stayed across the street from Myeongdong and visited almost each of our 5 days. Each time we went back we saw something new that we missed in the past. Perfect location to stay."
Shopping shopping and shopping,Here is one of the most popular shopping area for HK people in Seoul. However the items here become more and more expensive. 
Shopping and foodie haven,"Of you love shopping then one day here would not be enough for you. We went here on a Saturday though and there were so many people, mostly Chinese tourists, that it was difficult to go around the shops without bumping into someone.It was the 2nd day of autumn so most of the stores put their summer clothes on sale. Great bargains in H&M.Try the TOP TEN store, they have good clothes at bargain prices.Most of the shops there sell cosmetics. I didn't buy any but they had good prices too.Tip- wear comfortable shoes and don't bring anything bulky or heavy so you can move around comfortably."
lots to buy at a good price,"A good place, if you enjoy the hustle and bustle of shopping, lots of variety in consumer goods and lots of variety of food. Good place to cosmetics"
Interesting place to see street vendors.,"It is a huge area that in the evening really turns into a market in every street as cart vendors arrive with their replicas or pirate merchandise of things such as burberry, louis vouitton, gucci socks, shoes, scarfs, throws, headband, pony tail holder, etc. etc. Some of the carts have prices, which I suggest you buy there as where there is no price when you ask they gave you a higher price that the one they gave to Korean people. Just for an hour or so is fun to visit it.Also in the area there are lot of stores of skin care products."
too expensive and not kind people.,foods no good and expensive and we couldnt find big and tall size clothes. one of stores were very very tiny to us even though the size was 3XL. we felf bad. 
"Great Walk, Great Shopping","Myeongdong is in the center of Seoul, I found many great shopping options, beautiful areas for walking or having a quick meal or drink, and it has easy access to Myeongdong metro station and to Lotte department store. Once you arrive there I would recommend you take a walk to Namdaemun flea market near by."
Shop a lot!,"Its a place where you shop till you drop, lots a great food attraction, small clothing's for bargain. Night life is also extremely busy and happening. Definitely the most skincare shops in Seoul, free samples around if you just take a stroll into their shops."
Great Energy and movement,I stayed at the President Hotel so I was very close to this area. It is great for shopping and eating . Most places close late so you can walk around at night take photos and eat.
Love this place,"OMG This place is amazing, full of little streets teeming with street vendors and restaurants and if you are into Korean skincare, you have come to Mecca, with every brand of skincare shop that ever was all in one place. Had my phone stolen in August, so sadly no photos this time, but revisiting in Oct and will post then. Absolutely fantastic and fascinating place, especially for the ladies!!!"
Great attraction,It is good to see the nightlife here. So busy and happening. There are so many food places here and shopping to see. love the rush rush of nightlife
Great street food at the night market,"Visiting Myeondong Night Market was a good decision because the food is delicious and cheap. You can choose from a variety of street food--juices, grilled meat, dessert (ice cream). There are also many dry goods (bags, shoes, clothes, etc.) in the stalls that are reasonably priced. But you need to compare the prices of some food stuff with the grocery. We found some items to be overpriced."
Stay Focused and You Shall Succeed!,"This place might seem a bit overwhelming and perhaps even intimidating when you get out of the metro and see thousands of people running around searching for that special item of make up, clothes, shoes, bags or street food.In reality you just need to take a deep breath, look around, locate the main stores that are closest to you and slowly but surely make your way to them. Whatever you are after, you will find it here. Korean or international clothing lines, lots and lots of makeup: I highly recommend you try Korean brands. They are very affordable and very good quality, lots of stuff is actually organic, and you will never find organic make up, creams and what not cheaper than here. Every time you enter the store, they will give you free samples of hand creams, face wipes etc, and it doesn't matter whether you are actually going to buy something or not. Beware that lots of creams and lotions are whitening, so if you cherish your tan, stay away from those.The centre of the streets is usually occupied by the locals selling wonderful (and of course unhealthy) street food you should definitely try. The queues are impressive but move very quickly.It is easy to get lost as the place is usually packed, so make sure you set a meeting point in case you lose sight of each other in the crowd.There are all sorts of attractions like NANTA Theatre, N Tower Cultural Centre etc all withing walking distance from this area, so there is always something to do.The restaurants in this area are admittedly a bit pricey, so for food I would go somewhere else."
Cosmetic haven!,"This place is great if you want to explore all the cosmetics and facial care that Korea is known for. I and my daughter had a wonderful time checking out the different brands. It was difficult as not all brands have an English translation but we totally enjoyed the experience. We left with several bags full of cleaners, masks, creams, etc. for ourselves, family, and friends. We've already tried them and are very pleased with the results."
Wonderful experience,"Lots of people at night, with street food and shops. Very safe, even though the place is always packed. Restaurants can be expensive because they are taking advantage of the tourists. "
ladies paradise.,"cosmetic clothes and you name it they have it here. ladies will be thrilled by the various brand of cosmetics. from missha,skin food ,natural republic and alot more. there even have dog and cat cafe here. there is a famous dumpling shop in this area and always packed with tourist. you can take photo in the seoul visitor centre too. "
shopping mecca for trendy and stylish items,"Do you like shopping? Then go to Myeongdong, the most trendy and stylish shopping street in Seoul. If you are not so interested in shopping, you can visit Myeongdong Cathedral, stamp museum, Seoul Global Cultural Center, Kimchi making experience center and more, all located in Myeongdong, "
"""Shop 'til you drop""",Amazing! You can spend days shopping. Anything and everything you could possibly think to buy is here. But have self control or you will need to purchase a suitcase just for all the new stuff.
Shop till you drop,"There are sooo many shops around here. Selling cosmetics, clothings, bags etc. What you need, you can find it here. But some of the shops really sell expensive items. There are also restaurants, cafes. The shops closes at 12mn. "
Cold as h*** but still super fun,"A famous shopping street dating back to ancient times, it has both chain and independent stores and a fabulous variety of street food!"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"It was fantastic shopping here. There are shops galore and if you shop till night, street food is everywhere to try. Sadly the sizes are rather small and some shops won't let you try. Wear comfy shoes though else you might end up with aching feet.!"
Nice atmosphere but expensive,This is like a Must Visit place in Seoul. The atmosphere is great but you must go there during the night when the street stores are opened. But fashion is more expensive than other areas in Seoul.
Mainly tourist,"Like - lots of places to eat and lots ot shop,Dislike - it does not feel like korea, most folks here are foreigners including shop assistants."
Not recommended for cosmetics,"If you intend to come here just for the cosmetics (eg. Korea brands, Laneige, nature republic, faceshop, etc.), I will recommend you to go Lotte duty-free departmental at Exit 7 or 8 of Euljiro 1 ga (still in Myeongdong area). They are cheaper than the retail. You also don't have to go through the tax refund process which I find the procedure very troublesome.After submitting the tax refund form to the global blue or global tax free, you still have to go the custom at the airport to have the form stamp. My encounter with the custom officer at the airport is not very pleasant. The officer is very rude and unhelpful and does not speak English. If you buy from the retail, it is more expensive and you also have to spend more than 30,000 won to be entitled for the tax refund. The shopping street is quite rowdy. The staff at the cosmetics shops are all Chinese. They will shout (high pitch) to draw you to their shops."
OMG,"I loved it!!! You have every brand, you name it , they have it..not very cheap though but you dont go there for souvenirs you go for real shopping spree...I'll be back for sure."
Red House Restaurant in Myeong dong,Visit red house restaurant if you are around. Very nice place and nice seafood ever in the street of myeong dong
A place for shopaholics!,"I have to go there every time I get a chance to go to Korea.It's always crowded with people, a lot of interesting fashion products, especially cheap but well-made cosmetics. It's like a heaven for shopaholics!"
Myeongdong is fun,"Lotsa shopping lotsa street snacks and good food. What more can one ask for? I stayed at the hotel right on Myeongdong, and enjoyed shopping there. Bought lotsa facial items and had lotsa snacks. I must have put on some weight!"
Myeongdong shopping area,"One of my favorite places to shop. I never cease to shop here as I find many interesting restaurants, clothing stores and cosmetic shops."
Touristy... but still likeable,"There is a noodle place that is tucked inside an alley, they serve North Korean style noodle, a must try. Cat lovers (that's me) would be delighted to find that there are cat cafes there."
Make time for it,"Too much to see, not enough time. If your priority is shopping and your budget allows you to indulge, I suggest getting Myeongdong out of the way during the first few days of your stay. It's one area I feel I didn't have enough time to fully appreciate because we saved it for last on our trip. The eateries ended up looking the same, and so did all cosmetics-selling stores. "
Shop until u drop!!!,"Market where u can find a lot of knickKnacks.. Like socks, make up,facial stuff. Etc.. It's a place to try also there specialties in desserts like sweets or candies they make out of scratch n put minced nuts.. They were all delicious n u buy them on the streets.. A place u shouldn't miss when u r in Seoul ..."
Fantasic shopping for the ladies,"Myeongdong is so full of life in the evening, with plentiful street food, restaurants, cosmetic shops, and hordes of people. If you are female and enjoys Korean skin care and cosmetics, this is the place for you. You will see all the name brands like Innisfree, Tony Moly, Etude House, Iope, Laneige... EVERYWHERE. The stores repeat on almost every corner, so there are multiple stores of every brand in the area. Prices are much cheaper here than buying overseas, so you see people buying products in bulk. In fact, if you want to buy a single item(instead of like 20 eyeliners at a time. hahaha), you need to ask them to separate the package. They will do this grudgingly. There are also currency exchanges everywhere here, and the rates are competitive. However, if you can go to the bank, the bank still seems to have the best rate. Food here has a lot of varieties, so dinner here is a breeze if you are adventurous. Definitely come here at night for the atmosphere when everything is lit brightly, crowded, and energized. :-)"
Nothing special,There are just too many skincare shops on one street. Lotte department store is packed with Chinese tours but it is worth going to the duty free shop.
Ladies Market with lot of lights all around,"I went to this market on Sunday evening, the place was crowded with lot of young Korean girl and boys. The first thing that you see in market are the glittering lights and then nearly 70 percent of the shops cater to cosmetics with lot of girls asking you to try the shop. It's a shopping heaven for women, but for men I was pretty bored and even the clothing was not cheap, I could get the same in my country. I was new to the country, so did not dare to try the street food which otherwise was looking good. If you have ladies in your group then visit the market otherwise for only boys, one could avoid. "
A lot of shopping!,"This was where I bought a lot of my souvenirs. They have almost everything one could think of to bring as souvenirs. But many of the goods were expensive. As a consolation, there was plenty to eat while we go shopping."
"Shopping, Eating, & Skin Care!","It's THE place for skin care products. What this means is that; Ladies grab your shopping bag and begin your shopping spree! Goods are of good quality, price is reasonable for skin care products, but not for fashion clothing. "
You won't get bored,"I already visited this place more than 20 times. Sometimes I visited this place more than once a week. You won't get bored since you can find everything here. For tourists, this is the best market for you since all of the staffs here can speak English well and some of them can speak other languages too, such as Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more.You can also find a lot of famous restaurants here that it can be said this place is heaven for shopping and culinary"
"Loud and crowded, crazy creams and make-up Galore","Myeong Dong is an area of Seoul entirely dominated by a vast array of beauty shops selling Korean beauty products. Some of these shops sell cute products in the shape of bunnies or bears, but for most of them you won't really be able to understand what they are for and what they are made of, since almost everything is only written in Korean and the shop assistants hardly speak English. Even if you are a western tourist with snow-white skin, the shop assistants will still try to sell you whitening products (!!!) at any cost, since it is very fashionable in Korea to cover the face with white creams to look as pale as possible (considered as beauty ideal). Be aware not to fall for the miraculous anti wrinkle creams made up of some unidentified snail parts (some say the slime, others the guts of the snails...) that they will try to sell to you at extortionate prices (10 ml for 70 GBP), as there is absolutely no evidence that they work, apart from making the producers rich, of course. They also sell trillions of masks, some again made of snail parts, some again whitening, some with the picture of feminine-looking local Kpop-stars on the package. You are expected to wear these masks for some 40 min and use one every day, again, I doubt that they may do any good at all.The shocking thing about this area is that you will find up to three shops of the same chain in the very same street, selling exactly the same stuff, and another one in the next street on the left and another one on the right, which means that you are surrounded by the same shops and the same products over and over again, until you get sick of it. Myeong Dong gets incredibly busy from noon onward, so I suggest that you go as soon as they open, if you can, to avoid the total chaos. I found the shopping experience there interesting but up to a certain extent, after which, when it gets crowded and loud, you will wish to depart from it asap. Stay away from the street food, as there is no indication that the sellers wash their hands before, during or after its preparation and you may end up spending the rest of your holiday confined to your room.Myeong Dong can be reached by underground, line 4, station name Myeong Dong."
Great shopping area,Nice brand outlets confined in one shopping area. You don't have to walk very far. It was Choseuk holiday when we went so shops were giving good discounts
Best for cosmetics lovers :),"I visited Myeongdong to find souvenirs, as read on some blogs and websites, during a recent trip to Seoul with my sister. When we got there, I was a bit disappointed as it was an area full of beauty shops all lined up right beside and across each other. You'll see the most common as well as local brands such as The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Etude House, Holika Holika, Innisfree, and Missha. I am not a fan of beauty products so I didn't enjoy the place that much. However, I loved Myeongdong due to the many restos and street food stalls in the area. It was also fun to sightsee young Koreans take a stroll in the crowded streets dressed in their usual cute outfits.If you are looking for new beauty trends and products, make sure to visit Myeongdong. All you need (and want) might just be around the corner. :)"
Shoppers' frenzy,"An absolute highlight for shoppers (especially Chinese). Food vendors, trinket-selling carts, big malls like Lotte, shops for clothes, cosmetics and lots of restaurants and cafes. Myeongdong is made for a half-day happy time. People watching is fun enough if not going for shops. Walk down till the end you can find some inexpensive restaurants, also in the narrow side alleys."
crazy shopping,"so much fun on seoul and bought a lot of stuffs such as sports wear, food and cosmesticslike nine tree hotel so much ,good service"
One of the better markets in Seoul.,"This place has both, the small road side shops and branded outlets. There are quite a few cafes and eateries too. I personally found this place better than the Namdaemon market."
The People Watching Is Better Than the Shopping!,"I enjoyed an evening stroll through Myeongdong. Now, there are lots of repeat stores. SkinFood and GaceTime and the other cosmetic shops have locations every few blocks. But, its interesting to just stroll and check out the stuff and people. If you're in a hurry -- this is the wrong place! I took a list from BBC or CNN of the best ten skin products for women and bought my wife and daughter several each. You do find good specials and they gave me lots of ""samples."" Prices on US and Euro brands are higher here. But, it was well worth an evening. "
Great fun evening,Opens up at about 6pm and starts to BUZZZ at about 8pm.I advise that if you arrive to your hotel in the evening to just drop your bags and go straight out to the streets.Many ATM's around that you can just pull out South Korean won for cash (its a market so you need cash.)Go hungry and snack along all the stands like the locals do. Then head upstairs into one of the bars overlooking one of the streets and people watch!
Busy shopping area.,If you like shopping then this is a must. You could really shop until you dropped.I went with a group for 4 ladies who planned the trip to buy cosmetics. Ended up going in every shop twice. They absolutely loved it. My salvation was a nice dinner at one of the many restaurants in the upper parts of the buildings.
"Buzzing, energetic, full of young people, shops and eateries","Nice to go and see what the youth of Seoul get up to, but make sure you are not tired and are full of energy. Even then some might only manage a half an hour in this crazy, youth filled, colourful, maze of streets, eateries, shops, stalls and street performers. People everywhere. I am not sure there is a quiet time to go as this was a Wednesday evening. Maybe during the day? And when its quiet without the vibrant youth is it worth going? Probably not. Nice to stroll around and observe the culture of Seoul from the perspective of the young people. However not a huge amount of actual South Korea heritage to be seen unless it is being exploited for tourist reasons."
Raining,Still we got some good buy with 50% on good hiking shoes!Staff quite friendly but too many cosmetic shops!
Loved it,"I'm not a huge shopper but I enjoyed getting ridiculously lost for hours around here! Street food, free beauty samples and lots of atmosphere. You've got to experience it at night :)"
Great place for Retail Therapy,"Seoul`s #1 shopping district. Lots of cosmetic shops, restaurants & international brand outlets. it`s crowded most of the time and the noise from the barkers are quite dizzying. "
Shop Til You Drop - Literally!,"Myeong-dong is just about the craziest shopping area I've ever experienced! We went in the early afternoon and stayed through the evening, and it's just as bustling during the day as it is at night.You can find a wide range of shops and vendors here - from nicer, indoors shops to cheaper, outdoor artisan vendors. There are barkers shouting at you from every angle to come into their store and enough neon to make you believe it's noon at midnight.There are also lots and lots of coffee shops, sweet shops, restaurants, and convenience stores if you work up a hunger while shopping; but I suggest visiting one of the street vendors for fresh fruit on a stick, gimbap, or a spicy, boiling hot plate of tteokbokki.Apparently, there are a LOT of plastic surgery practices located in Myeong-Dong as well; which makes it a super popular place for tourists who have come to get less expensive surgery.Make sure you wear good walking shoes and drink lots of water. It's easy to get dehydrated and tired rushing around this area. But, if you're looking for something trendy at a good price, this is the place to be!"
Busy,"There's a lot of great, fashionable stores in Myeongdong. The street food is delicious too. Sadly, I didn't get to stay in Myeongdong for very long but it was a lot of fun. I'd recommend to stay a few hours for all of the shopping you can do. I'll certainly return when I go back to Seoul!"
Shopping paradise!,"If you like shopping, this is definitely your place!There are literally hundred of stores (clothes, electronics, beauty shops) both korean and international brands. There are also lots of places for eating (korean or western style). It is also really close from the N Seoul Tower. Not enough exact words for describing this place, it is just a must-visit location."
Crowded place,This market is crowded both during the day and at night. Lots of eating places and shops. close to a subway station.
Not for the faint of heart,"Myeongdong is a must-see if you're in Seoul, but it's extremely busy and if you have any sort of social anxiety, avoid it. It's very noisy, there is a huge crush of people - many of whom have no qualms about barging people aside - and it's full of distracting sounds and sights. However, it is good for shopping, eating and has a handful of great movie theaters. "
Sigh.,"Myeongdong is a good one stop place to get all your Korea's shopping need but that is about it. (If you only have 1 day to shop, thats it.)The service at the Myeongdong main area is the worse.If you go into cosmetic shops and you don't look like you will spend, those foreign store assistants would not even entertain you. Getting a snide remark is not uncommon from them.And if you do look like you are going to spend a lot, they are going to follow you throughout the whole time you are in there because they get commission from the sales, so they are just gonna stick to you like crazy glue.The street food are pretty good though and Myeongdong street food is one of the places that always develop new Korean street food. Then again, there is always Hongdae and Edae, and the experience there always beats Myeongdong."
a lot of tourists,"Worth it when you need something and walk around. Other than that, it's pretty touristy as there aren't a lot of the locals in the area."
Good Market .. But!,"Well known district for shopping and must visit. The many brands ,Korean and International is available and the indepandant selling shackes are providing alot of options.The Pricese are a bit High in compaer to other markets.Overall, its nice area to hange out with family or friends all day."
Lack of visible toilet areas.,You need to walk into a cafe - order something - then have access to a toilet. I guess this is a given in such open space shopping areas. I wonder where vendors go to take a pee when nature calls. 
Shop n Shop,"Never image there is the most busy busy street, A lot of hawkers on the streets, whatebver you like foods/ goods........ you can find, a lot of different nationality tourist shop around. It's like carnvial. "
always something happening,"shopping, streetfood that is fairly cheap and quite good, performances by musicians, lots and lots of shopping,."
So Many Stores So Little Time,"I liked the place because aside from the shopping there were also a lot of restaurants where you could take a break from after shopping. I noticed though that some stores like The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Missha, etc had so many branches within the same area."
Shopping and Eating,"Nightmarkets and makeup shopping. Even I as a male recognized that the makeup and cosmetics being sold in Korea were a huge steal. With store upon store next to each other in high density, one is able to buy all sorts of products and also get many freebies. The multiple face masks we received for free for entering the store are normally $5 Canadian so even visiting the stores gave us some things to bring back for our friends. Lots of restaurants to choose from. It was fun!"
Awesome,This is like orchard in singapore. A lot of shops for branded bags and clothes. What I love most are the street foods they are so awesome
Hyper Shopping,"so much fun , i went several times, This area has a lot of shops, many major names, and a fair assortment of smaller ""boutique"" Plenty of cosmetics shops for the ladies to feast, so ladies “Shop Till You Drop for the Ladies” .the only thing i dont like is how in your space are the sales associate"
Great to stock up at H&M,"Great deals at H&M with US sizes and trends. I believe there are two locations at the Myeondong Station. Tired of Shopping? Have lunch at anyone of the numerous eateries that include California Pizza Kitchen, Outback Steakhouse, TGIFridays and many others."
Interesting experience,"This area has a lot of shops, many major names, and a fair assortment of smaller ""boutique"" operators. As others have commented there are a very large proportion of shops - and branches of the same shop - selling skin care and beauty products.There were a lot of tourists and locals when we visited, on a Friday afternoon, and we spent a good three hours walking around the warren of lanes in the general area. There are no shortage of eating venues, coffee shops and food stalls should you find yourself flagging.Worth a visit for the experience, and if you want to buy skin care products, you will be spoilt for choice."
Shop Till You Drop for the Ladies,"Plenty of cosmetics shops for the ladies to feast. Don't be surprise to find the same shop at different streets. There are also plenty of clothes. Quality differ from medium to good. In the evening, food stalls will start lining the streets. Myeongdong is also more crowded in the evening and at night."
Cosmetic wonderland,"Upon reaching the station exit, you'll be greeted with food stalls.I would recommend coming in the evening onwards because that's where stall vendors come out to put out their stalls at the roads. So you'll get more activities going on. But that also means, more crowd.If you come in the afternoon, it's fine too, you won't really miss out a lot. And you'll get to walk the streets more easily.Shopping here is mostly for cosmetics than clothes. Fixed shops are your usual H&M, American Apparel ect while store vendors are your usual korean flea market kind.Remember to try out the egg bread and other roadside food stalls!"
Nice place but expensive,"Lots of stores to choose from, from food to cosmetics. Beauty shops normally give free samples. Just walk around and you'd end up having lots of stuff. You could be easily lost as there are many streets but I suggest to wander around the area to scope for the really good finds that are hidden in some places.Don't be excited to buy everything you want from Myeongdong. Some items can be bought at other markets at a lower price."
a place where the young should go,"lots of young people are there. nice street shopping and food. if you want to get to know Korean young people, their fashion and fun stuffs, this is the place for you:-)"
One-stop Place For Beauty Products Shopping,"Countless shops selling a huge varieties of beauty products! I think I went in to the same shop repeatedly but no...same shop on different streets though...You can find frantically every single stuff for your top to toe beauty needs.Faceshop, Skinfood, Too Cool For School, Nature Republic and many more.Excessive supplies I would say but that is why the Koreans ladies are so beautiful. "
my heaven,"highly recommend for girls. best shopping area and for food, but you might see same cosmetics store in every corner. I walked to myeong dong twice a day, I will always book my hotel in Meoyng dong area. very convenient"
Great buys for face masks and cosmetics,"Many shops for clothes, cosmetics and food. Each shop is unique and there is so much to see and buy !!! Simply love the bargains and the salesgirls AND salesmen - YES !!! guys recommending best cream for your face and hands - are all very patient and sweet."
Wonderful shopping and cafes,"Really like this wonderful place for shopping and eating. Many cafes around to indulge in. Children will simply love the many shops selling K-pop music CDs, poster and other souvenirs. A good spread of local and international retail brands, average and high-end fashion and clothing etc. Great place to pick up Korean fashion that this both reasonable and trendy. "
Best Place for Shopping in Seoul,"I can stated that Myeongdong is the amazing shopping centre in Seoul. I went there at night and this place is very crowded by tourists and locals till' 11 PM. You can find many food stalls, souvenir shop and a bunch of many worldwide branded shops as well as Korean brands (esp. cosmetics shops). The location is also very strategic, you can get there by subway or bus. If you want to feel the hype of Seoul's night, I very recommended you to visit this place. Don't forget to taste the local tradition foods. Its a must!!"
Amazing Place!,I would recommend a look round here!Really busy but the hustle and bustle was great. Loads of street food for you to get your teeth into. I would go in the evening around 5-6pm as this is when it really starts to liven up. Loads of shops with the standard worldwide brands along with Korean brands also. 
Good chilling area,"It is a good area to chill out.. Gets super crowed on weekends, but still joyful. Best area for buying clothes in seoul. "
'Fusion Shopping' in Seoul,"This place is one of the most liveliest place in Seoul, Korea, always buzzing with people. It is the place to visit for someone who likes shopping. This place where one can find some of the world famous brand shops(likes of ZARA, H&M etc.) in one street. On the other hand, there are many famous Korean brand shops too. This fisuion of local and international brand shops makes this place worth visiting. Also the famous 'Namsan Tower' is nearby the shopping destination. It will only take 8-10 minutes by walking from the shopping place to board the cable car ride to the Namsan tower ."
"Shop, shop, shop!!",Many Cosmetic shops and sales girls will lure you in to buy. I did and was happy with my purchase. There are many restaurants.
Fashionable shopping area,We will see many of shop that selling fashionable stuff especially local branded. It's very indulging for everyone who love to shopping. Also we can find many local cosmetic products here!
well equipped shopping area.,This place is great to do shopping and find some street food to eat as well as some good restaurants to eat after getting tired from all the walking around. You could spend days looking for something you want there.
Shopping center,Myeongdong is one of the shopping destination area in seoul. Restaurants and cosmetic shops are abundant. You can buy cheaper cosmetic products here than other area in seoul.
Interesting shopping district,"Myeong-dong is an interesting shopping district. Lots and lots of food places, shopping areas for street clothes or boutique clothes. It is definitely a shopping haven for everyone. Food places consist of authentic Korean-type restaurants and fast-food outlets. Dozens and dozens of beauty shop outlets as well. A definite must-see."
Amazing shopping paradise,"I'm not a shopaholic but still totally stunned by how dynamic the shopping environment is, richly fuelled by a wide spectrum of products."
heaven for hyper shopper,"Many thing you may buy at this place, shirts, the cosmetics, exotic street foods and others. you will find many interesting items to buy. many shuttle bus from the hotels will stop at this area. "
Really funny and interesting district,"We stayed in the Ibis hotel in this district, and it has been really good choice as we had a lot of shops, restaurants and really good atmosphere in this part of the city. Amazing how crowded it is at any time and how shops close so late in the evening, at 23:00 hrs or so.... Full of restaurants, some at street level, other in a 1st or 2nd floor and really hard to choose where to have dinner without tripadvisor!!"
Everything you need for skin*.* or clothes,"Even if you don't buy anything, it's worth visiting because it is quite unique compared to usual West-European shopping areas. Never seen anywhere so many coffee shops & restaurant packed with shops. Please, have a look up as well because there might be 5-20 shops in one building and you see only the one with a window :-). "
"Great Shopping, Entertainment, and Street Food","Great Shopping, Entertainment, and Street Food. Probably the busiest shopping area in Seoul with all the labels and fashion you could be looking for. Also a great area to just walk around and taste all the street food. Certainly a good day of adventure. "
Hyper shopping indeed,"Crazy shopping particularly for the females, however you can find the brand name clothing stores here. Becoming quite touristy so be wary of the crowds. Most stores open after 10:30am - 11am."
Cosmetics heaven,"If you're here in Seoul for beauty shopping, this is the right place to be. Beauty products, samples, bi-lingual, tri-lingual staff linger in doorways to cosmetic shops every 10m. When you need a break from the shopping frenzy, head for the cafes which have great waffles, ice-cream and free wifi."
Beautiful Shops,"The streets were quaint and interesting. the shops had unusual jewelery, a lot handmade. The clothing in the stores was different and unusual, but suited for Ametican wear. The shop keepers were friendly and helpful about their merchandise. It was fun to walk around the area."
"Crazy area, but fun","We ate at the Myeongdong area a couple of times. The place has alot of stores and outside vendors and lots and lots of young people. The soft serve ice cream is so good. Green tea with vanilla or strawberry were my favorites. Bought a purse from an outside vendor, my hubby bought some street food, NANTA Theatre is right there, even a burger king and mcdonalds. There is definitely something for everyone. Good restaurants too. Lots of fun. Close to the Lotte dept store which is huge."
"Buy one, get one free","If you are a shopaholic you may never go home. It is easy to get to, clerks speak English and the prices not too outrageous. I bought a shirt there on Tuesday at 3:00 PM for 30,000 and bought the same shirt at Dongdaumun on the same day at 11:30 PM for 18,000. "
"Skincare shops, skincare shops everywhere.","The title says it all. Walk down the street of Myeongdong and you will find 8-10 skincare shops per block. Walk down to the next block and you will find the same skincare shops but in a different arrangement. There were many clothing stores as well but some are the usual stores like Uniqlo and Zara but others are small boutiques selling extremely expensive clothes which I think is overpriced and overrated. For made in Korea clothing, it's cheaper to shop in Dongdaemun or Nanta. There is also a big flagship store of MCM leather goods but seeing every asian tourist carrying one, it immediately became a turnoff for me to purchase one. The street food there is wonderful. I love the idea of a cart selling cut grapefruit right out of the peel. Healthy and delicious. When i was there, this cart was right in front of Nanta Myeongdong near a Burger King. Fresh lemonade was also essential when walking around in the sun. In short, a very convenient place with everything you need. Most of the food we've tried here were good."
A paradise for shopping,Enjoy shopping at those funky little shops and roadside stalls very much and with lots of eateries to try out. A great experience for shopaholic!
Worth a visit,"This place is like a Grand bazaar of IStanbul. Lots to see but not much to buy. Quality of street food are not high- Just take a look. Anyway, this is definetly a fun place to visit. Very close to palaces of Seoul."
Shopping Paradise,"Imagine rows and rows of shops and cafes congregating at one area - Myeodeong. Yes, that made it a shopping paradise for us all. There were many cafes and fashion outlets - gorgeous Korean dresses going for reasonable prices. There were accessories shops that offers a lot of glitter and blink blink, succeeding to catch the eyes of passerbys easily.Best of all, there were many skincare shops with skincare products going for incredibly good prices. There were many exotic brands that we have not heard of, because they were not imported over here.The retail crew were all very friendly and generous- whenever we passed by a skincare brand we would receive many types of samples without having to buy anything - facial cream, facial scrubs, facial moisturizers etc. For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html"
Crowded,"It gets too crowded every evening, mostly with tourists, mostly japanese.A BIG spot to shop and the best whatsoever. Try to come on weekday, preferably daytime. Thus, ypu'll get a chance to shop and not only be moved by a surrounding crowd"
Good street food during the Summer sale,"Starting early evening the Seoul summer sale in Myeongdong is the perfect location if you want to discover Korean street and easy-to-eat food. You can also get some shopping, meet people in the crowded and vibrant atmosphere of that night market."
Heaven for those who love shopping,"As most feel, is crowded and a lot of shop lots, and most are branches. After being in Seoul for a few days, i am already immune to those beauty branches and more interest to the street foods."
"When you think you have nothing to buy, Discover here how wrong you are","This area is packed with multiple skincare and beauty shops (Nature republic, Missha, TonyMoly, Seatree, and repeat shops within 100metres away). You will also find ABC Mart (great deals on shoes), branded Sportwear, Fashion wear,.. etc... with also some pull-carts on interesting accessories like phone cases, scarfs, etc... and SOCKS too (so many interesting designs /characters and costs only KRW1000 per pair, its hard to resist!) Lots of great food eateries too, and especially in summer season, the cold noodles is a must (you can have it dry&spicy, or in an iced soup base)."
Shopping and street food,Shopping paradise - certain shops are tax-free but you need to ask during check-out. Great place to experience local street food and there are plenty of interesting things to see. Word of caution: public toilets are limited in the streets.
Let go of your personal space bubble...,"This is a shopping destination that some, but not all, shoppers will enjoy. It's generally chock full on people on weekends and many evenings. If you don't appreciate being pressed and shoved in all directions at once, or shouted at in about five different languages, you might want to stay for a half-hour at best to take a few photos, and then head to a different shopping district outside of the CBD. Personally, I enjoy the lively atmosphere, although I enjoy it less now that the novelty has worn off.In terms of fashion and beauty, you can find pretty much whatever you need in this area. There are plenty of good restaurants and street food stalls around, and if your tastes are a bit more high-end, take a short stroll over to the Shinsegae or Lotte department stores. Personally, I head here when I plan on spending time at Forever 21 or H&M, since these chains are rare in Korea."
Almost anything for everyone,"There are many shops here and the streets are packed with people especially in the evening. This is a shopping heaven for the ladies especially for cosmetics and facial products. They are many promotions going around to attract foreigners. The more things you buy, the more freebies you get. Didn't expect much when I came here but I went back with loads of shopping bags. Clothes are slightly more expensive but they are mostly boutique style. Plenty of dining place and a lot more street foods in the evening. The people in the shops can't really understand English but luckily they have Chinese speaking sales person so it was fine for us but it might be difficult for non-Chinese/Korean speaking tourists. Generally, a lot of them can't speak or understand English. Expect to spend at least half a day here if your intention is to shop."
Shopping and dining paradise,"All major brands of Korean cosmetics and skincare are found here. Most are Chinese-speaking, catering to people who speak Chinese Mandarin. Crowded with vehicles passing through. Street food is nice. Myeongdong Dumplings is a must-try. There are money-changers for those who need more KRW, but the rate is not as good"
Cosmetics Paradise,"This place is really a cosmetic paradise! Brands such as missha, tony moly, holika holika, the face shop, nature republic, etude house, primera etc. can be found here! The more you shop, the more freebies you get! It's really a wonderful place. I wish I have more time to spend here! There are many delicious street food here as well! You don't have to worry that you'll starve while you shop to your heart's content. It's a must-visit place if you are planning to come Seoul for great cosmetics and facial / beauty products harvest!"
not enough time,I would love to spend more time there! I couldn't go to every shop there while I Was with my daughter. 
Busy and crowded district,"This is one of the most interesting and at the same time the most hectic place of the city, many tourists and a high concentration of people, including high-rise buildings and shops, in short, a very lively part of Seoul. I went there in the afternoon, I saw some pictures at night and I must admit it's always nice to come here."

Great Shopping Avenue!,"Hi,I have been to Myeongdong in Seoul in June'14. It is such a great place for shopping enthusiasts, esp. females... it has so much to offer for both budget shoppers and high-end shoppers.. Fashion, Cosmetics, Korean Herbal products are the key highlights. All in it is one of best place to hangout and must visit in Seoul, South Korea...Cheers!NT"
Crowded and too commercialised,"Shopping here is fun as there's so many things to buy here. However, many outlets of the same brand can be found in the streets and it's like a repetition again. All the salesgirls will keep persuading and convincing us to buy in bulks.Honestly, I prefer to shop in Hongdae area "
shopping for the enthusiast,"Very interesting shopping, a variety of shops selling fashion and cosmetics made ​​in korea along the way. The place of Korean youths hangout with a very interesting outfit. ."
lot of sample,"u always got sample when u buy korean make up in seoul, when u purchase something and the cashier will give a sample . but here, they attract u to take a look their shop by give you a free sample (like mask, cotton, and more) . there a sales girl or boy that welcome u and give a sample in your shopping basket just outside the shop. bare in mind that not all cheap in myongdong. i just bought a cleansing foam from faceshop cheaper in namdaemun in the one day before i go to myongdong (buy it in the faceshop regular store)"
I never get tired of this place,"If you are a shopholic or a cosmatic lover, this is heaven for you!As a Thai, this place is very well known for cheap/best discounts for cosmatics and super loads for free samples but after I experienced this place, there are a lot more than that!You may found out that many sellers can speak Chinese, Thai, Japanese and also a little of English. It's very helpful but sometimes it's still hard to understand what they said (but of course, better than notthing)There are many cloths shops that you may take time for a week to discover them all.For food, there are many Korean and Japanese restaurants. I recommended School Food on the 5th floor of the same building of Zara (sorry I forgot the name)Only con that I found is there are only a few restrooms. "
Awesomeness,"It is a conglomeration of awesome shopping in one place, from cheap to luxury, it has everything. If you love K-Pop or K-Drama check the upper levels of some of the shops because they have some good places tucked away for DVDs."
Cosmetics and Food Heaven,"The place to go to purchase Korean cosmetics at heavily discounted prices. However, Chinese speaking staff are extremely pushy and would do anything to ensure a sale.The place to go to savour street food. Food is prepared in hygenic conditions. Many restaurants too"
Best place for shopping and food,"I just loved walking around myeongdong, shopping and eating. Loads of cosmetic shops, local food and certain international brands there. Just love it"
Shop till your hearts content,"Crowded with people mainly tourists from China, buying skincare. The same brands of skincare shops are in every street. Each time you walk into a shop o buy an item, you will get many samples to try. Do try & visit the Daiso, as they offer a decent selection at a good price. "
Great Shopping Experience,All the shopkeepers can speak Mandarin which is very convenient. The Cosmetics shops will give a lot of sample even if you buy just 1 or 2 bottles.
I could do this all day,"Shop all day. Go crazy. That's what Myeong Dong (and nam dae mun) is for. With so many different shops around, you can not , not find what you want. Free samples for cosmetic (face shop, holika etc... too many to mention) are given when you go in the shop. Just take, walk in, no qn asked. "
Shop til you drop!,"Wow - this area has every type of shop you could want, from high and medium end international chains, to some small cute boutiques. If you're a dedicated shopper you can easily spend a whole day here. There is also no end of places to eat when you need to rest your feet and get some energy.The area is incredibly busy and crowded so be ready for some serious hustle and bustle. It's totally worth it for the great shoes and handbags!"
Myeongdong Area,"This is such a vibrant and amazing shopping area. During the day it is pretty quiet and has just the usual shops open, but as night descends the whole place comes to life. Suddenly vendors appear from all over with their carts of wares, and really one can buy just about everything. The area has a very good Seoul Information Centre which we just discovered this time. They were so informative and really helpful, also selling various Korean things. In the area there are so many places to eat, all the usual ones, but also a wealth of other places, especially in the quieter side streets. There are also some lovely hotels in the area, and we have stayed at the Savoy and the Metro, both of which are very fully booked, so one has to book early. The subway is also right there which makes access so easy!! I have visited it many times and will return again when I visit Seoul!!"
Cosmetic! Cosmetic! Cosmetic!,"If you aim to shop for lots of cosmetic, this is the best place!There are Etude, The Face Shop, Skin Food, Missha, Innisfree, Natural Repubilc and some other not-so-top brands. If time permits, don't buy yet when you first enter one of these shops. There may be another selling the same brand down the street which offers better deal. I bought lots of ginseng masks from one Natural Republic store which had a ""buy one free two"" offer. I only paid for 10 but got 30 masks! Other stores only offered ""buy one free one"".Besides shopping for cosmetic, there are countless eateries in this area too."
Shopping and people watching,"If you have tons of spending money, here's the place to burn it. Three story H&M? Check. Five Etude Houses on the same block? Check. More shoe stores than you can possibly visit in one day? Check.It is unbearable on weekends, so try to go during the week or early in the morning. If you're lucky, you'll see the ""666 You're Going to Hell"" guys walking around with giant signboards. Lots of restaurants, lots of tourists. If you go underground, there are lots of cheap shoes, bags, and accessories.Namdaemun market isn't too far away if your prefer something traditional, but expect to haggle and perhaps pay a ""foreigner tax"" there. "
"Shop, eat, shop, eat then shop again",This place is everyone shopping paradise for those who just love to shop till you drop dead gorgeous. Just make sure to melt your credit cards away making plenty of purchase. Dont be afraid to drop dead while shopping as food is just within reach... Every turn and every where you can just see these restaurant that sell every kind of korean and international food.
Every trip!,"I have to say that a trip to Seoul won't be completed if you don't go to Myeongdong. I always go there more than once every trip. Good shops, good food, nice crowd, and a new shop pop up every time! If you love Korean cosmetics, this is a place where you can get every brands. If you are into K-fashioin, this is a must place also. highly recommended!"
Eat and shop,A lot of different skincare brands and each brand has many outlets. Some items are priced differently in each outlet so can check it out. A lot of street food which definitely is a must to try!
Good selection of everything,Street food was great. Local restaurants in area were great as well. A lot of stuff for sale. The cool part was we were there on the night of their local art market. There were tables of handmade goods being sold and local artists performing. Really special. And the goods being sold were truly made in Korea. Location is near Jamba Juice by the display of different types of money
Shopping at Myeongdong,"It's really fun shopping at Myeongdong last November with my daughter and my sister and her daughter. Maybe it's because we are all ladies and there's a lot of shops cater for us. And there is also roadside stall selling all kinds of korean snacks. We were like shop and eat, eat and shop all the time. I will surely go again if time permits."
Shopping Centre Close for upgrading,"went there on Sunday, shopping center was closed for upgrading. a little disappointment. was hoping to get good deal there."
Must visit,"Myeongdong is a wonderful choice if you only decide to visit one shopping area. It includes different kinds of stores, different styles, also have small shops, as well as Lotte shopping mall and DFS."
Good for window shopping..,"Good for window shopping...very accessible and nice place to shop. However, price is much higher then other place. "
Local Stuff,Big market having local stuff. Don't think of quality. Having 10000 KRW stuff but all are local and very cheap quality. If you want quality than you have to pay 3-4 times higher than standard prize.
Exciting and vibrant shopping destination,"Lived right in the centre of Myeongdong which made it even more exciting. It is alive from the early morning till late night; without any of the rowdiness or calamity that usually comes with these kinds of shopping areas. The streets are clean and usually crowded but still allows plenty of space to navigate safely and stress-free. Loads of small shops selling clothes, skin care (galore!), food, shoes, accessories, etc. Endless choices, great value! Food vendors which come out at night add to the vibrancy and give you a good opportunity to experience good food. There are also plenty of food outlets which offer excellent meals; both local as well as international cuisine. There's always something to discover if you walk around long enough. Great experience!"
Crazy Saturday,We (family with two teenager daughters) went to Myeongdong on a Saturday and was blown away by the atmosphere. The streets were filled with many people and the shops were amazing with many discount. And there were many snack options. It was a great place to do window shopping and to find great bargains.
Great shopping ,Am staying in Myeongdong area. Shopping was fantastic! Good prices and good selections. Found some good value products. Especially facial products. 
Beauty all the way !,Every second shop was Beauty shops where you can see most of the Seoul people shopping all thru the day !
dynamic place,"Bunch of people during weekend, however, it is good to look around for weekdays."
Feel the soul of Soeul,"It's a very crowd shopping alleys for youngsters. Feels good walking there. Lots of different shops there, mostly Korean brands."
Great shopping!,Lots of good buys and lots of people! The most fun shopping especially bargaining with the vendors. A must do in Seoul.
"Shopping addicts, here you go","If you love Korean stuffs and a fan of these Korean telenovelas, this is a haven for you. This is Seoul's #1 shopping district for nothing, it got everything. No need for further introductions, upon arrival in Seoul, get a taxi and shop till you drop. Visited last Sep-12 during ""Experience Hyundai"" trip."
"A good place to shop, crowded with those of tourists.","If you haven't been there, it's a good experience...but personally I won't want to go for the second time."
Heaven for a shopper!,"No matter you are a real shopper or only a window shopper; Myeongdong is really a ""heaven"" for you. The only problem for me is I found nothing to eat because am vegetarian. "
Nice place to shop!,"This is a large shopping area just next to the metro. Many many shops and side streets with different types of cafes and restaurants.There are many many Korean cosmetic outlets in this area, most have MULTIPLE shops, so that takes away some of the charm of the place.If you get lost or need help, there are these young people dressed in red (Tourist Information) ready to help in English, Mandarin or Japanese.I love the street carts and street food available here!"
Cosmetics heaven,"This place abounds with cosmetic stores, food stalls, shoe and clothes stores. We love Korean cosmetics for its price and quality: Nature Republic, Skin Food, Missha, La Neige, Étude House, Tony Moly, Face Shop etc. An added bonus is that most stores are generous in giving samples away together with your purchase. We were fortunate that most stores were on sale. Buy what you need as soon as it is on sale because a few days after, they go back to regular price and the store will feature another product at a discounted price. We tried soft serve ice cream at one of the side streets that had a long long line. The ice cream twirl was about a foot tall for only 2000 won. We had the green tea/vanilla flavor."
Best shopping in Seoul,"I've lived in Korea for a while and this is the best place I've found to get western sizes for both myself and my girlfriend. With many shops like H&M, Forever 21, nike and others its great one stop shopping. They are also a number for street venders for purses, phone cases, and other nik nats. Which make it great for tourists as well. There's also a lot for food options but they tend to be on the pricer side. "
Great Shopping!,"This place is great for shoppers with its varied and affordable buys. If you are tired of the shops, you can always walk to Shinsegae Dept Store or Lotte Dept Store too. And the subway is just at its doorstep."
Everything you may think of,"All types of shops,, brand names in the main street & traditional products in the side streets ,, very nice walk makes you feel the spirit of Korea."
Best place to shop!,"I went to Seoul with my friend and we have to admit that it is the best place to shop.They have all kind of shop from cosmetic store to supermarket, simply heaven for girls!Most staff in cosmetic shop are able to speak multi languages, its helpful for tourist and they give samples generously. "
Cool to see locals and tourists enjoying this area,"SO MANY SHOPS! if you like shopping you cant miss this... so many shops so much to see, the korean culture is everywhere in this area! loved it... the Cathedral in this area is beautiful as well.If you get hungry there are many korean as well as american restaurants around, you can find anything korean here"
Shopping and walking streets,I went to Myeongdong many times and I feel tired of walking and shopping at the end of the day always. But if you are a shopaholic like me then hardly you can stop yourself wandering around the streets for hours. Dont forget to energize yourself with street foods. I like the potatoes and the the chicken most.
"Shop all day, shop all night","Awesome shopping district with a mix of global and local brands, as well as some from neighbouring countries (e.g. Daiso discount supermarket). Nice promos and ads going around."
Disappointment 7th time around,Myeongdong used to have a variety of shops...now mostly cosmetic shops selling '24K Snail Cream'! Side streets still have interesting small shops selling locally designed and manufactured goods. Way too crowded at night and stores such as H&M have taken away the 'local' flavor that was once Myeongdong.
Loved shopping here day or night,"I stayed at Ibis Myeongdong which is just around the corner walking distance. I loved the shops here, great for Korean made makeup and Creams.During the day there is all the regular shops open from 9.30am and from 5ish pm all the street food and Accessorise stalls come out. It is so much vibrant at night time and very busy. Loved everything Myeongdong had to offer, definitely a must if in Seoul."
Wow,"This place was buzzing with activity even at 11pm (local time) which was amazing. It is filled with 1000 of stores - including restaurants, street food and a huge variety of shops (male and female). The buildings are also 4 levels (or more in some cases) which means the amount of shops just increases. There is also several streets or isles which you must go down to get the entire experience. Both points just adding to the shopping experience."
Shop till you drop,Don't forget to ask for discount with cash payment. Looking for sale item as well. Another thing is don't try to negotiate and touch the item if you're not sure to buy.
Best shopping,Women will love the skin product shops which are abundant and cheap but apparently of high quality. Street stalls start setting up at 5 pm. Shops are good value and I believe the quality to be better than Nandemun market. 
no one had my size,In London with a waist size of 36 and shirt collar of 16 I have no problem in finding clothes to fit.I was given outsize trousers which ioffer could not put on my legs and no shirts my size.so a fruitless hunt.I suggest trying th food hall of the little department story.so much to see and eat here.
Perfect for Skincare Shopping Only,"I think only women will appreciate shopping here & mostly for Korean skin care products since all brands can be found here in multiple outlets ( a testimony to how well they sell? ). The shops sell mostly foreign brands which may prove cheaper back home but we did find the selection of sports shoes here to be more expansive, like Japan. Koreans love their shoes so I guess that's why the collection here is more complete. You can find a few local brands here like 8 Seconds which may be worth a look for the ladies."
Shopping Heaven,"This is basically shopping heaven and food street all rolled into one. If you have money but not sure where to spend it, this is the place. Fashion, accessories, hair salons, even baby clothes, cafes, restaurants are available at every corner. Sales staff from skincare shops shout out to you in Mandarin (well done!) and flood you with info while enticing you with samples just to walk into their shops. The street foods are delicious and very tempting. Try the towering soft serve - and eat it very quickly! If you want serious shopping, plan at least the whole day here."
Great shopping location in Korea,There is so much choice here and the place is buzzing. There are a lot of food opportunities as well. I would recommend going here if you want to shop for fashion and beauty products
Best Shopping For Reasonable Prices in Seoul,"In this shopping streets (hundrets of building) you can find almost everything you need and not need. You can find here all kinds of textiles, tools, animals, foods, simply a real whole sale market. As here also koreans buy their stuff, please don't be afraid of body contacts. Here is everybody pushing everybody. That is Asian peoples cuture. Also you should not negotiate too much in here, as the prices are quite low and the Koreans are not cheating foreigners like in many other countries. So i wish you a good experience and enjoy the time here."
mostly textile concentrated,"it is mostly textile concentrated and I could not find any good deals. the up is that a number of shops is open till very late. there is also an openair market that opens at around 10-11pm but price/quality ratio is not good. The textile I like the most in Korea are socks. There is a huge selection, OK quality and cheap."
Gem of Gems,"I initially didn't understand why Asian tourists (Japanese and Chinese) are mad about this place. So much to do, shop, eat and enjoy. Korean cosmetics shops offer so many free samples (quality of Clinique and L'Occitant at such amazingly affordable price). Cinema I visited offers such professionally sounded and clean environemts at US$6 per movie. Shopping in general is very good and cheap for such quality. There are so many well known restaurants (simply look for the venue in long queue). Most of famous restaurants in Myoungdong isn't like fancy ones, but known for the tastes for generations. Easy come easy go kind of places, from dumpling, Korean sushi, Korean BBQ, noodles (both cold and hot), Korean styled fried chicken (assorted or spiced), pork cutlet et el. All accept credit cards except street food. Korean seems quite honest with the price, so they won't rip you off because we are a foreigner, but always try to negotiate to cut 10%, which they gladly offer (in street store, not in a shop). Transport is available to all directions, and I had a very good time. I personally make sure to stay nearby (Westin Chosun, Lotte Hotel or Grand Hyatt) when I visit Korea for business. Sort of old town with genuine fun. "
shopping for beuty products!,its the place for those who is looking for skin care product. the price were really cheap and affordable. besides they give you lots of free sample!
good shopping and street foods," lot of stores and good clean street foods... expensive stuffs but good quality made in korea, stores and restaurants are open late at night"
SHOPPING AND FOODS,"It's really amazing to go on shopping in this area were you have a lot of options. Actually you might get confused because it is really A LOT of options to choose from, from bargains to well fashioned boutiques. Street foods are also must try because they are all delicious!!!! I'll go back!!"
Huge!!!,"We came here after visiting Namdaemun Market as it is close by. We were already exhausted by the time we arrived but had so much fun wandering the streets. My teenage daughter and I enjoyed getting the free samples of face masks being handed out. Even if you don't want to buy, it is nice just to be courteous. So I recommend to go into the shop and browse after receiving the freebie and then thank them as you leave. We did not buy very much however it is an experience to see it all and the crowds of people. The area is great for cosmetics and clothes and many restaurants to choose from."
Soo many shops,"This is the one of the high-end shopping district in Seoul where you can also find local cheap accessories. Plus, there are plenty of street food and local restaurants for a quick bite or to dine-in. I went here almost everyday, just to stroll around since they are very near to my accommodation. Seoul is also one of the most fashionable city in the world, and thus, you could find a lot of great clothes and accessories."
Large shopping area,"Myeongdong Shopping is one of Seoul's main shopping area. It is a fairly clean and modern area with departments stores, lots of shops and restaurants."
Shopping-heaven,"Super vibrant and lively area. A lot of great shopping, especially cosmetics (make sure to get some free samples). Great korean street-food there as well. We came back several times for the shopping. Make sure you check out the malls in the area (can't remember the name, Lotte maybe?)."
Shopping Paradise,Myeungdong is a shopping paradise for the young - lots of good eats there also - fun to just spend time looking around! 
Shopping Haven,We went to Myeongdong on a Sunday afternoon and the place is crowded! Very lively place! There are so many things to see and food to taste. Cosmetic haven for girls! 
Excellent street and market food,We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere here. Yes it was busy but that adds to the whole fun and hype.If you are not a fan of busy times go during a weeknight like Monday-Thursday it's not as busy.Great food options with market stalls everywhere and obviously lots of shopping
Major shopping central,"This is the place where you can get pretty much everything. From shops selling tourist knick knacks to cosmetics to household items. Food galore too. Lots of korean food options in the little lanes. They have tourist booths spaced out in Myeongdong, get lost just head to the tourist booths to get a map of the area. This is also a short walk to Lotte Shopping Centre."
One stop shopping!,"Myeongdong is great! There are so many eateries to choose from, many modern stores, and many local vendors on the streets. There are many side streets with good priced items. Definite tourist attraction with something new on the streets daily. You can enjoy the cat cafe's, massages, or even a fish pedicure (Prepare for weird sensation). Great stop through before or after Seoul (Namsan) Tower!"
Rev up your shopping instinct,"We arrived at Seoul early evening and went directly to Myeongdong's shopping area which is right across our hotel and started our eating and shopping spree. It was right after christmas and the neon lights all carried a strong air of festivity. Although it was -7 C, the place was packed with people, locals and tourists alike. There are plenty of stores including brand names for the serious shoppers and hawkers also lined the street sides. I noticed that cosmetics and personal care items are hotly pursued items. My interest was however more on the street food in particular the curly potato chip, the fish cake with bean paste filling and the egg muffin all freshing baked and served piping hot which were delicious and heart warming in the cold weather. It was a pity that we started our trip that night with a heavy dinner and so little room was left for the many other yummy street food items like squids, fish cakes etc etc. We returned to our hotel around 10pm but the place was still streaming with people. I was particularly impressed with the cleanliness and orderliness of the place, and one feels safe to roam around. It is a must go place for anybody who happens to be in Seoul, and indeed, we went back three nights in a row to continue with our shopping expedition!"
A heaven destination for both Guys & Gals (not to be missed!),"whatever you want, you can find them all in Myeongdong. Lucky for me, i stay at euljiro-3 ga (Kimchee Myeongdong Guesthouse) so its a real good walkable distance for me. Varieties of cafe such as Holly's, Twosome, cafe bean to name a few is all there. The whole streets is always soo cheerful regardless of the hours & cold weather. You can find all sorts of delicacies there, street side snacks (varieties of them!!), nice fashion & accessories, shoes, socks, cakes, bags OMAIGOD! I can just stay there for hours to just explore every nook & cranny of it! Guys who are tired of shopping with your gf can just pop by any cafes there, its literally all around you. Compare to Dongdaemun, I'll say Myeongdong is much more interesting."
Two Visits -,"The first time we went in the afternoon after we went to Namsan Tower. It was unbelievably busy. There were people and food stalls every where. All the shops were open and busy. It was a great atmosphere. At the time it felt a little full on. I think it may have been a holiday in Korea that day??The second time we went in the afternoon on a week day, it was pretty much dead comparatively. I was really surprised. There was almost no street food around, and it was just like a regular number of people walking around shopping. It was definitely more exciting when there were more people. Which is the exact opposite of what I expected!! If you actually had some things to buy i'm sure it'd be easier on the quieter days though!"
Typical Shopping Scene,This was a typical popular shopping area in a big city. The streets are packed with stores lining the streets and vendors trying to pull you into each of their stores.
Shopping,"Myeongdong offer a lot of things from cosmetics,clothes to street foods until you got headache which one to choose..crowded with people as it is one of tourist attractions for shopping but the price is quite expensive compared to other places.."
A definite must go place,"Name all the things you want and you would find it here! Very big shopping area, super delicious street food, lovely people and very clean area! If you are in Seoul, this is a super definite must experience shopping place! You shouldn't miss it!"
Shopping area for everything,"This place is a huge shopping area that you can have everything to buy like clothes, make-up and foods. Every time you enter to cosmetic store, they will give you a free sample like facial mask, facial foam etc..If you're tired of shopping try to eat the different street foods, the food are tasty and delicious."
Shopping shopping,"You can find everything from ZARA, H&M, Lotte, many street snacks, and hawker stalls selling cute socks and other stuffs. Most shopkeeper speak Chinese very well. Find the best rate for USD to Won at money exchange in front of the Chinese Embassy."
Never get enough to shop here,"Can't wait to visit Seoul back and definitely I'll come to Myeongdong again.Ladies, enjoy your huge makeup, accesories and girls things here...If you use korean cosmetics, don't hesitate to buy in extra items. You'll regret it once already back to your home. Because it's extremely cheaper even if you compare it with any online shops. And definitely it's original product and you'll get abundance sample every time you buy. Love it right?!"
so exciting!,"it was excellent that we have booked a hotel inside this hyper shopping area!you can find a lot of things. mostly Korean products. many many cosmetic products for women (and men too, surprisingly). lots of places to eat, street food are tasty and cheap, and clean so safe to eat. We have bought some nice shirts and shoes and other souvenirs. It is hard to convert to your country's currency as the won has low value compared to other currencies so prices are in hundreds and thousands even for simple items. nice to take photos on the middle of the streets. The sales attendants are polite and charming. Definitely a good way of observing the modern Korean life especially of the young and how they dress themselves. On the evenings it is particularly interesting with the neon lights and all.."
everything you want,"everything you want from food, clothes and accessories. in some big corners there are tour guide and information staff that speaks multiple languages and are very helpful! "
nice place to visit and window shop,"a huge shopping area, they give free maps with english speaking staff in the theatre area, loved the street food..."
Too touristic,"The street is mainly for people watching I would say. Although there are a lot of shops selling cosmetics, however they are too crowded. You can get the same cosmetics or clothes at Hongdae or Ewha with cheaper price. Not a fantastic street."
Shopping shopping shopping ,"One of the many places for shopping. Grab a map of the area so that you will not get lost.Visited this place almost every night and each visit has a surprise find. Lots of food and cafes too.If you are an early bird, start the day with beakfast there and slowly spend the rest of the day shopping and eating at Myeongdong."
"Fun, young, and crowded","Experience the true energy of the youth of Seoul - great shopping and restaurants - street food and cafés. Most of all, it is about the absolute jam of beautiful humanity packing the streets and alleys as they shop. The energy and vibrancy is amazing. "
awesome night and day,we visited this area both at night and during the day. Well worth the visit for street food and some good shopping
Funny to but extremly young crowed,"This is a busy shopping part! there are tons of stores, but you have to be very young to find something here,.. for the 30+ there is already not too much,... and what they have you can also buy in other places and malls"
excellent place for shopping and lots of food to eat!,"This is really a place which you will shop crazily for whatever stuffs, especially the local brand, which the price are so cheap if you purchased overseas... I will be back for shopping, not for hours but for dayssss.."
shopping everywhere,"If you need to buy skincare/cosmetics, this is the place to do it. Since it is so touristy, all the workers in the shops we visited were pretty good at multiple languages, including English and Mandarin. Before you start your shopping, make sure you narrow down what you want to buy or you will wander the stores for hours and end up buying more than you expected/planned.There are many coupons available online so print them out (multiple copies, even) as the shops will always collect them. One link for coupons is below (most should be valid until Feb 2015):http://www.vkc.or.kr/en/benefit/coupon.asp"
Is there anything else than make-up shops?,"That this shopping district is crowded is no problem, you can not expect anything else. But what really is little bit crazy is that there seems hardly no other shops than for make up. Even fashion shops are only a few and if you want to buy something like a camera or a computer this is totally the wrong place."
shop 'til you drop,"A vast shopping, bar and restaurant area mainly targeted at the younger set. Busy, especially at weekends, this is great for brand name products but lacks more Korean traditional outlets that can be found in nearby Insadong. The korean shop staff can be a bit unfriendly and english is not often spoken as mostly the shops cater for the many tourists from nearby mainland China."
Don't miss to visit here,My wife and my daughter priority choice to visit when we plan to go to Seoul. Very good cosmetics products and the price is very fantastic compare to Indonesian price for the same product.
Best hang-out place in Seoul!,"Myeongdong is a hotbed for the young and chic, with plenty of bars and clubs, and European-style cafés, as well as a multitude of shopping outlets for major international brands. It is probably the ultimate hang-out place in Seoul – and luckily my hotel was right on its doorstep!Myeongdong as a location is fantastic. On every corner there are quaint cafés and eateries, as well as lively bars with loud music. At night this is especially prevalent. Although I did not seem to take any photos, I can assure you that street food is very popular in Myeongdong as well. The sights, sounds, and smells all contribute to an amazing shopping experience walking through this part of Seoul, be it during the day or in the evening.I have travelled to Ximending in Taipei, Bukit Bintang in Kuala Lumpur, TST in Hong Kong, Shinjuku in Tokyo, but I think none of them were as immersive and as impressive as Myeongdong. Give yourself a whole day here to explore the nooks and crannies - and that includes a meal or two, seeing as you'll be there most of the day anyway!"
Cheaper cosmetic and skincare but poor service from shop assistants & overcharging from cab drivers,The entire area is filled of different cosmetics brands. Prices of cosmetics are cheaper however shop assistants are mostly chinese and are not friendly. Go to myeongdong area if you wish to utilise discount coupons if not the same shop in other areas like edae or hongdae as shop are not as crowded and freebies from those area are better too. myeongdong is also an area that is filled with lots of good bbq restaurants. IMPORTANT PT TO NOTE : cab drivers at this area dont accept meter rates and would extort by quoting a high rate. We even met a cab driver from Haechi Seoul ( Orange cab Plate no : 37 2273 ) that requested us to pay shortly after we board the cab and then he kept our money and requested us to pay him again which we refused and he chased us out of the cab on a random alley. Be careful of such drivers!
Too Much to Absorb,"We arrived Saturday evening in Seoul and, as soon as we were checked into our hotel, we headed out for the half mile walk to Myeongdong on recommendation of a family member who'd already visited.Mind-boggling is a good starting description of the approx six block by six block shopping area. Every street was jam-packed at ten p.m. There must have been 5-6 thousand people hanging out (and actually shopping) in these few blocks. The stores were all still open at 10 pm, including shops several floors upstairs from ground level access. You'll find dozens of coffee shops and hundreds of restaurants. The middle of the avenues are packed with booths of street vendors selling anything from beautiful hair wear, to socks, to T-shirts, to curled potatoes fried on a stick. Or ice cream. Unlike the street markets of Thailand or Cambodia or Bali, nobody solicits your business, except a few people offering massages. You're free to wander and gawk at the merchandise undisturbed, till your heart's content.Some stores are franchises you'd find in the west and are quite pricey - others offer wares at extremely reasonable prices.There's something for everyone here. And if you enjoy people watching, you probably can't find a better venue."
Shopping Heaven,"Myeongdong is basically a shopping heaven for women.There is alot of cosmetic / facial shop. You will not be empty handed returning to your hotel as if you buy a small little stuff from their shop, there will still be freebies for you.Of course, the more you buy, the more they give their freebies to you."
Busy street,This is cosmetics heaven. Don't worry if you can't get in one of the stores because there will be another one around the corner. Go in and get samples. Street food vendors line up the main road. It's interesting to see how cosmetics play a part in the life of Seoul.
Interesting place to get to know Korean street food,"This is an interesting place for a tourist to visit with many street food, and surprisingly the prices are reasonable."
One of the busiest areas of Seoul!,"No matter what time of day, you'll find this busy shopping and food area highly interesting. Many small shops abound around the many large department stores: Lotte, Shinsegae, Migliore, and M Plaza to name a few. Grab some street food or try the famous Myeongdong Kyoja restaurant. I was fortunate enough to see a KPOP group perform a free concert on the streets!"
Shopping overload,"My hotel was right across this shopping area on steroids so I was able to see and compare Myeongdong in the morning, afternoon and on a Sunday night. My first visit was Sunday night and it was like a street party, seems like everyone was out and about even though it was a cool spring night, you can shop or you can people watch. Koreans, tourist alike and with loud music blaring from stores until late at night will get you in the party mood, if not the buying mood. There are a lit of beauty product stores, sometimes the same store on different streets. Etude, Innisfree, Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Laneige..just to name a few. Also some stores like Artbox selling cute stuff to take home, lots of stalls selling socks with Kpop idols face on them. I kinda hung around and just checked out the stores first and came back the next day since I already knew what I wanted to get. The vibe was great but I preferred Insadong for the more artsy, handmade and unique souvenirs."
Shopping Paradise,"Myeongdong is a must go place in Seoul. Best to go during evening to night. As all the street vendor that sell food and others comes alive. What you want there will have it. Best for shopping, eating, and hang out with friends."
Late Night Shopping,"Myeongdong is a very neat place to walk through at night and do some shopping with all of the lights lit up. Even though some of the stores are a bit repetitive, we still ended up buying some cool stuff. If you get hungry there are lots of food carts around with reasonable prices. Fun way to spend a night!"
Go to NANTA While You're Here!,"Myeongdong is much like any shopping mecca you can find in every major Asian city. But if you're spending time in this bustling shopping area, give your brain and wallet a break and go see the outrageously funny production of ""Cookin' Nanta"", a slapstick comedy that you'll love. You don't need to know one word of Korean to laugh your way through this. It's at the Myeongdong Nanta Theatre. Just ask any shopkeeper in the area for directions, but I strongly advise advance tickets as this usually sells out. Don't take just my word for it -- check out more reviews in ""Things to Do' for Seoul."
All about shopping,"Large and small streets, large crowds, snack vendors and skin product pushers. This is where the real shopping happens, with shops open until 10pm and some even longer (at least on Friday and Saturday, not sure of other days). Expect loud music coming from many shops and a mixed crowd of locals and tourists. Fun and energetic experience, even if you do not want to buy anything (but be sure to try some the snacks!'"
Shopaholic!,This place is for those shoppers like me who loves buying. These Street Shops are complete. From accessories to a complete outfit! :)
Downtown.,"It was a center of the Seoul and still our downtown.But nowdays, our economic center has changed to Gangnam so MYUNGDONG is just a official downtown and Gangnam is a real one haha.It""s more modern and vital in Gangnam but Myungdong has It's own attraction.These days, many foreigners come here, especially Chinese and Japanese!!So in Myungdong you can see Chinese and Japanese menu in restaurants and shops.And cause there are many foreigners here, many non-brand clothes shops started their business. I recommend you to look around here and buy some souvenir haha.I guess most of you are intersted in Gangnam, and I think Gangnam is better than here.But each site has It's own attraction.So come here^^ Keep in mind we are very polite country.Most of us are poor in English!! but we are trying to help you.If you ask something to us, even if that one can""t speak English, he(or she) will try to find someone else who can help you or at least help you by a body language ..hahaAnd in Myungdong there are many people so you may find some one who can speak English.Don""t hesitate to ask us for help.^^"
Lots of nice stores,"Myeongdong is a huge pedestrian marketplace with tons of shopping in the heart of Seoul. The stores and restaurants are plentiful, and they are all near all of the other shopping centers in Seoul. They have more nicer stores that you would see in America. I highly recommend checking this place out! "
Everything is here,"Excellent place to shop and eat, Osulloc , Paris Baguette and a lot of cosmetic brands are here. The small shops in the lanes are good places to get a good deal for clothes, accessories and shoes. They close rather late so you can shop till you drop. "
Know your prices,"Good place to go for better, name brand products. Shops are within walking distance, its a pricey shopping neighborhood. Shops range from the Dept stores, to boutiques. All ranges of products, good, services. Look for Official tourist maps/guides to this area. As with any type of shopping in korea if you're a foreigner, know what the prices are back home, especially if you're an american or European. Import taxes on designer goods may not make these goods bargains."
Amazing!,"You will find every brand on every corner of Myengdong. Food is also everywhere.!!!! and the metro is just right there. Yeah, you can just cross the road and go shopping at Lotte Duty Free. Don't forget to bring a lot of money. That's all. hahaha."
Awesome :D,"A mecca for all trades - food, clothing, cosmetics are generally what you can see as you stroll along Myeongdong."
Shop till you drop!,"Great atmosphere,didn't expect to buy very much but came back with clothes,skin care,make up and shoes.Clothes in all sizes and communicating wasn't an issue as most people speak English to some degree.Were told prices were higher here than the markets but we didn't think there was much difference at all.Found some great eating places and cafes off the street up staircases on 2nd 3rd and 4th floors."
Something to see,"Ah, the sounds and smells of these types of places. More than you can possibly even figure out unless you read Korean. Something to check out once but not sure a typical visitor would really buy much here."
Great from women who love make up!,For people who have girlfriends or wives that love make up go here!! either it be night or day plenty to choose form they also have a variety of food and shopping to cater for everyone fashionable.
A cultural experience,"You can eat your way through Myeongdong. The food carts have everything. The shopping consists mainly of the same cosmetic stores on every other block. Only bought a pair of socks. It is very crowded, which is half of it's charm. Mostly the hang out of young Koreans."
Shop and Eat,A lot of shopping options and restaurants. Street food is abundant too! The prices are a little expensive though.
Shopping area,"Great experience. Lots of shops. If you love shopping, its place for you, but prices are very high in Korea."
"very crowded, still a good place to shop!","There are many shops to look around, so if you like shopping then it's worth trying. However it is really crowded especially in weeknds. So be careful! But you don't have to worry about pick pocketing or something like that. Seoul is a very safe city even it's a place full of tourists. oh but you don't want to spend your whole day here. Just pick up a map and visit some other places before and after. Enjoy!"
Paradise for shopaholics,"This is the place to go if you want to shop for everything ranging from beauty products (skin food etc), to Zara and Uniglo, and everything in between. You should visit both in the daytime and at night, as there are different vibes. Also, from early evening onwards, there are tons of street stalls serving pancakes, ice cream and various other offerings. For diners, you have a wide choice, including Korean bbq restaurants, American fastfood and Turkish kebabs.Definitely a must visit when in Seoul."
Shopping Haven!,"Everything is in Myeongdong! F21, H&M, Nike, Etude, Nature Republic etc. Be sure to try the street food! Take the subway and get off at Myeongdong Line 4 Exit 6. "
Super shopping!,"If you like shopping, this will be paradise for you. If you don't, suggest you keep away!The Myeongdong area is essentially a huge shopping district comprising shopping malls, boutiques, and restaurants all interconnected by lane ways and roads. In the evening, the laneways become even more lively as stalls open up. We personally enjoyed the atmosphere on the street and smaller boutiques more than the large shopping malls. Certainly picked up some bargains. Keep an eye out for the street vendors selling local delicacies. They have to be sampled!Be prepared for lots of walking and lots of crowds! Generally stroller friendly but many of the stores are rather small and you will be pushing through crowds. Closest station is the Myeongdong train station. "
A must do for Shopperholics,"Great and convenient location. Near Lotte Department store and Lotte Young Plaza. There are plenty of Korean brand skincare shops! Olive Young is the best! Everything under 1 roof - bought lots of skincare, food, hair products etc. Awesome place to shop for everything at Myeongdong! Zara and H&M and even Club Monaco are here. Highly recommended!"
The beauty of myeongdong,"Myeongdong is best experienced on the streets, not in the malls. Even if it's cold, just soldier on with a heat pack and everything would be fine. There are 4-5 outlets of the same brand within the area so make sure you are setting a unique meeting point if you're meeting friends. That said, it's overwhelmingly catered to female shoppers, with cosmetics and skin care taking up the majority of the lanes, and most of them are local brands. There is a sprinkling of clothes and bags and even fewer eyewear. If you are looking for international brands, hit the malls but that would defeat the purpose of coming to Korea to shop. The street stalls are equally interesting - there are food, 4000KRW scarves, 1000KRW socks. There's also shoes, belts and bags at various prices. Most are made in China and the vendors would charge a premium for made in Korea products. I would not take their word for it; if you are in doubt of their quality, don't buy. "
Shopping Heaven,"You can spend about four hours here just by going through all the different beauty stores, clothing, shoes, etc. There are also street food for sale if ever you get hungry after shopping. You'll also get a lot of freebies from beauty shops when you enter.I'm sure, you'll never leave Myeongdong without buying anything."
Young fashion Shopping in Seoul,"If you 're young people, don't. miss this area. A lot of store for shopping. A lot people go there for eating, shopping. You should go around 7pm , you will see how amazing there."
Beauty Heaven,"Myeongdong is absolutely beauty heaven. I've never seen another shopping district quite like it, the mega malls are excellent but the individual shops are definitely worth a look as well. Very easy to spend an entire afternoon shopping. Most shop attendants were more than willing to attempt English or communicate through signs to assist."
Overrated outdoor shopping mall,Not much sets Myeongdong apart from your typical Korean shopping mall. You'll be more comfortable indoors come summer and winter. Watch out for careless shoppers eating and waving their skewered sticks of meat or potatoes or you'll get an eye poked out.
Shopping district,"The shopping district in seoul. Has the mega malls like Lotte department store and shinsegae department stores. But the best is the small alleys and streets which has some of the best shops. It's the center for Korean cosmetics- almost all the major Korean brands have multiple shops across the area. You can get great bargains for the cosmetics and also some have tax free option for foreign tourists. Also has the Myengdong cathedral and myengdong theater, both worth visiting. Easily the place not to be missed, when in seoul. Shop shop and only shop."
Great shopping place,best place to buy ur make up and they offer reasonable price as well.. too bad they speak a little english which makes us harder to communicate
Nice Buzz,"I love this place! A very busy and big pedestrianise shopping mecca. Lots of shopping centres and food stalls and stalls that sells all sorts of stuff. The big attraction here is Face shops! There are plenty here and the main thing to buy is face mask!. I got pack of 20 for 20,000 Won and the sales lady even gave me some samples. "
Polyether!!!,"Terrible, everywhere they write about wide range of clothes choice, but there is nothing to choose. Polyether is every where and they call it designers clothes!!! Don't spend your money for this..."
Heaven for shoppers & food enthusiasts,"This is one place in Seoul that we loved so much my husband and I came back 3x and I don't think we can say we explored every inch of it! When you come earlier the streets are still passable by car, but come after lunch I think and it is filled with food cards everywhere! While I had my pick going from one cosmetic shop to another, my husband was doing the same with the food stalls ; pAmazing place, despite the crowd it was very safe, no pickpockets, no fighting. A bit of shoulder bumping I guess but all in all I'd gladly explore it again."
Shop & Eat Till you drop,"Some reviewers said that it is like Orchard Road in Singapore, but I beg to differ - it is far more interesting! Besides the big brands like H&M, there are many many small shops in the entire shopping streets. You will need at least half a day to shop and eat here. The streets get crowded and more stalls show up at night. What interests me is the Korea-made clothes/bags. I bought a pretty good quality leather sling bag (Korean brand) at around KRW 37,000. Good quality blouses and cardigan at KRW34,000 and up. Saw cheaper clothes but the quality does not appear to be as good. Only thing is that all shops I went did not allow trying of blouses or pants, but you can try on the jackets/cardigan with no problems. Most pants and skirts I saw are free size, therefore no trying. They may be more suitable for slim and petite ladies and not so much for taller people."
place to burning money,Big shopping street in Seoul. many restaurant theater so many shop and cosmetic. but most cosmetic there only korean brand i can see.
Shoppers' heaven,"Countless facial & cosmetic shops with staffs giving out free samples as you walked past their doorstep.The place become more interesting when night falls with street food and push cart.Confusing walkway, be sure to approach those tourist guide in red to get a detail map of Myeongdong to help find your way around."
Tourist Shopping,"Nice street for tourists. Nothing special, you can find almost everything in China or USA, and everything is higher priced than in the states."
the shopping experience,"been here twice in my entire stay in seoul. i just loved how there's so much variety of products being sold. the place is packed with a lot of people any time of the day but the place remained clean despite that its crowded. there are a lot of street food choices and i have tried most of them and they're all delicious and cheap. i couldnt stop eating that i was so full i couldnt eat dinner anymore. there were lots of souvenir items but one thing stand out, there were so much beauty stores in the area and they give you a lot of free stuff like facial masks, moisturizers etc. you must visit this place at least once if you go to seoul."
Shopping and Food Heaven,"Myeongdong is a must visit place for tourists. It has several major department stores like Lotte Department Store and Shinsegae Department Store and there are street stalls, retail outlets and beauty outlets. There are also plenty of restaurants, fast food and street foods in Myeongdong."
Amazing night time shopping,I could have spent all night walking up and down the main road in Myeongdong. I love the electric feeling you get surrounded by all of those people. It was crowded but not too crowded like Times Square. A MUST DO when you are in Seoul. 
Gone crazy over shopping,"So much to buy! Make up stores like Etude, Face shop and Tony Molly are everywhere! They give free samples right before you enter their shop. There are a lot of street food too. One of my favorite was the waffle with strawberry which costs around 3,000w.You can also find Dog cafes in the area. "
Shops Errywhere !,Myeongdong is a must go for shopping and for food. Here will be filled with tourists and shoppers all day. There are big brands and small brands but the food here is exceptional.
Shopping,"The shopping was interesting!! Cafes galore!! However, the facial shop got stale after walking past identical ones rows after rows..."
"Festive ambience, great shopping!",Multiple super sized shopping malls and lots of street shopping and food too. Crowded and fun! Tourist info is a good stop for help and tips. Found a great hair salon called Juno. One of the best experiences - fast efficient service but also warm and accommodating. We came out with great hair in 45 min!
Shopper's Heaven!,"Myeongdong basically has everything you need when it comes to shopping. Clothes, make-up, bags/purses, shoes, eyewear and restaurants for when you need a break. From designer and brand name stores to independent stores, it's got it all. It's definitely a must when you come to Seoul. The crowds can be a bit much after awhile but as long as you prepare yourself mentally ahead of time that it'll be super crowded, you'll be fine."
"Great for eating and shopping, but not for the claustrophobic","If you want to shop (beauty products, clothing, hats etc) or eat (street food, restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream etc) then you should definitely come here. But be forewarned that it is packed, it is busy during the day and then even busier at night. Great place for people watching, especially since you'll be swarmed by lots of people."
Great place to shop and eat,"Myeongdong is a commercial area and therefore it is less chance to experience the real korean shopping. Most of the shops have staff who speak different languages, eg mandarin, japanese, english etc to serve tourist from different country. This is one of the excellent service you don't find everywhere in the world. Only shortfall is it is always too crowded, especially at night, one can hardly move around. One can try to come in the day, nothing much to see but can find some nice restaurant hiding inside the small lane."
"Walk, eat & shop!","Loved this place, even though Seoul was chilly during my visit. You don't even have to shop big time. What I loved here were the different kinds of street food and the stuff they sell on the sidewalk."
Full of peoples and Sales..,"this is the place you want to be if u want to shop until you drop..from high end brand to local brand, and of course a good food...been there just when its The Grand Korea Sales, and for the girls..this is the place you want to be for all your cosmetic/make up needs."
"FUN, FUN & MORE FUN",MYEONGDONG is a fun place to be! Great shopping and endless food choices from fast food to korean restaurants --- to streetfood!!!This place should NOT be missed during a visit to Seoul!!!
So fantastic consumer paradise！,You can buy what you need and obtain the unexpected harvest.So many restaurants in it;So many cosmetics shops in it;So many cafe in it……
Love this place!!,"Myeongdong is a vibrant area of shopping and food. It is probably best experienced at night when all the street vendors come out! There is an immense amount of shopping and lots of street stalls selling local delicacies, hotteocks being my favorite! The atmosphere is amazing here but ve aware of annoying sales ladies from the skincare stores yelling at you in mandarin ( if you look oriental and not korean of course! )"
just shopping,Taken there by the hotel shuttle. Just your typical shopping fare. Crowded and all the interesting odors of food and clothing combined.
Myeongdong,It was a bit on the crazy side of things when i was there so I'm not to sure if everyone loves begin harassed when you are simply looking around.If you can handle that then you'll be fine and you can get some good deals provided you are willing to barter with the vendors 
Fun place to shop,"Excellent place with tons of shops for my wife (cosmetics) and places to eat (must try the street food). Do try the Tornado Potato and tentacles of fried and dried octopus and squid. They really are some of the most delightfully flavorful and pleasingly textural item from the sea. West of Myeongdong is the Namdaemunmarket market after passing the Shinegae department store (10 mins walk), heading East is the Myeongdong Cathedral (enter through the Myeongdong-gil and up the hill). Best way to arrive at Myeongdong is my metro, get out of Myeong-dong station using exit 6 or 8 and head north."
"Busy, Busy, Busy","I can't speak much for the shopping, but if you want to experience hordes of people and neon signs, this is the place. "
A funfilled shopping experience...,"I am not a shopping freak.. rather shopping actually freaks me out.. However, I must admit Myeongdong, provides a totally different experience. .. Myeongdong means Bright town and the place actually stands by it.. It has a air of liveliness driven by some road side vendors along with some good mid range brands like ZARA, Mango etc.. A nice place to shop around for some distinct souvenirs, where tourist generally look out for.. as well as some regular use stuff like jackets, caps etc... Place is well equipped with plethora of restaurants and bars offering local as well as continental flavor.. I enjoyed my late evening strolls around the place during my visit. The liveliness of the place with nicely done decorations for just passed New year and upcoming Lunar (Chinese) New year added to the ambience.. I understand that it has been selected as a UNESCO heritage place and I would say rightly so..."
Girl's favorite,"Based on the limited schedule.I only spent 1 hour in this area.This is a girls' shopping heaven in downtown.Hundrends of cosmetic brands & fashion shops.The area is huge,you can take a whole day around.Coffee pub and restaurants all around so you can take a break any where if you want.Really a crowded shopping area.I'd rather sitting in a coffee pub to watch people.The local youth are all here at weekend.A must go!"
Pure crap,"All the stuff you can find anywhere in the world. Cheap, but boring, unless you need some new cheap underwear and shoes."
Crowded but a Shopping Must See!,"Myeongdong was a place we would come back to time and time again when we were living in Seoul! There is lots of American stores there, like Forever 21, the Gap or Louis Vuitton but also tons of Korean souvenirs and stores. You can find everything from cheap street food to high end restaurants (some of the best spicy rice in the city) when you get hungry. There are vendors all over the streets as they block cars form driving in the area. Whether you are looking for clothes, cosmetics, souvenirs, or just a coffee shop you will find it all in this area! It is crowded in the evening and on the weekend so be prepared to wade through people unless you get there on a week day. However, Korea is very safe so you don't have to worry too much about pick-pockets or anything of that nature but of course you should always be cautious."
Such a fun area,Tons of people every night of the week in a very large pedestrian only setting. Lots of shops as well as street vendors selling everything including great street food. try the octopus!
For shopping,"It's a very crowded area, so if you don't like crowds, it's better to avoid it. On the other hand, it's a great place to shop, not expensive, accessible, with many big shops and street vendors. You can find pretty much anything clothes, hygiene and accessory related. There are also some inovation stores. It's cool :)"
It's beauty products and more,"I used to think Myeongdong is just a place to buy beauty products, but I was so wrong. There are so many things to buy, from clothes to shoes to bags and accessories. I bought a pair of boots for $19 USD and the quality is quite good!And when you are hungry, there are street stalls selling all sorts of food and even gigantic balls of candy floss!Wear a good pair of walking shoes and shop till you drop!"
"Super, duper, busy shopping area of all types","This is an unparalleled area of SUPER shopping; small shops, primarily, altho one sees a larger Zara and a few others. Most sell skin solutions, make up, fashion jewelry, shoes, furs, scarves, accessories, shoes. And then there were the many coffee houses or all variety, and congee shops, food stalls, juice stalls, and eateries. There is a 24 hour shop-a-thon, as we in America would call it, during this time and people are milling around almost constantly. There are hawkers to attract anyone inside many of the small shops as well as signage for those who are hungry or thirsty.It's quite an event but everyone is polite and friendly."
Shopping,This place was jammed with people even in the freeze temperature in January. Many restaurants from Burger King to local tradition restaurants. This will be a great place to buy the Korean facial and make-up products. 
"""Cool but crowded""","Loving the shopping here, althought usually very crowded and some things are overpriced. Got really cheap bags for 10 000 won here. "
Great for shopping and grabbing a bite to eat!,There's a whole lot of shops there where you could buy just about anything. I enjoyed the cosmetic shops as everything was on sale and everything was so affordable. Another great thing about this area is that there's a lot of food shops to choose from and all with reasonable prices. If you want a quick bite you can also purchase street snacks that look amazing and affordable as well. Definitely one of the best places for shopping in Seoul. 
Everything in one place!,"There are 2 ways to go this place which are Myeongdong Station (Line 4) and Euljiro 1-ga Station (Line 2). You can find almost everything here and there is a lot of sales person who can speak Mandarin, English and Japanese. There are many branded store here such as Uniqlo, Giordano, Zara, H&M and etc. And this place is full of skin care product stores such as Nature Republic, Etube, Skin Food, Face Shop and etc.(Most of them provide tax refund for spending more than 30,000 won) Near this place, there is Lotte Department Store which is a shopping mall that must visit and Namdaemun Market for cheaper stuff.In a nut shell, this place is full of foreigners who are coming here for shopping. However, there is no night life here. So, if you are planning for hanging around during the night time, then you are looking for the wrong place."
"If you love shopping, you will love Myeongdong","Shoppers paradise! It is easy to get lost in Myeongdong as there are many branded shops with various outlets in the same area. EG you will see Etude House 3 or 4 times in Myeongdong alone so do not navigate via landmarks! Great for fashion shopping and cosmetics - the ladies will go crazy. For cosmetics, always ask for samples as the sales ladies will oblige, if your bargaining skills are good, every purchase is a bargain! Street food was amazing and had a good variety. Good way to recharge and warm up during the cold winter months! Especially the roasted sweet potatos - nice and warm when the weather is about 2C. Lots of nice boutique cafes on the 1st floor to while your afternoons away over rich dark chocolate or hand drip coffees. Look for the funky ones that have a bit of character.WIFI everywhere - it is easy to remain connected wirelessly at all times given the free WIFI provided in the area. "
market of market,"Great prices here, beautiful light streetNot going to myeongdong = theres no spirit of koreaMany korean restaurants here also"
"Myeongdong , great place to watch and mingle with the locals","Its a nice place to know more about the general populations especially at night times where all sorts of hawker style and also push cart sales outlet were available, from typical strawberries dipped in chocolate fondue to any other type of garments being sold openly .Poeple are always on the go and at some times the streets was heavily packed with people trying to get in to the restaurants."
Claiming cash for tax refund at Myeongdong,"The objective of this review is to share how to can get CASH for your tax refund at Myeongdong. By doing so, you can save one step at Incheon International Airport.When you shop above KRW 30,000 in one receipt (from any shop that has the Tax Free logo - and of course this applies to all shops in Korea - not only in Myeongdong), ask the cashier for a tax refund slip. The shop will either give you a tax refund slip in a white and blue envelope (Global Blue Tax Free) or in a white and orange envelope (Global Tax Free). What I did was to accumulate all these tax refund slips until the day before I depart. Group all the tax refund slips according to 1) Receipts/Tax Refund slips with bar code under the Global Blue Tax Free (white/blue) 2) Receipts/Tax Refund slips under Global Tax Free (white/orange) and 3) Receipts/Tax Refund slips under Global Blue which are handwritten. Those under Group 1, you claim at the Global Blue counter next to Woori Bank at Myeongdong. As you walk along the main central street of Myeongdong from Exit 6 (Myeongdong subway station), it is on the right side of the street - somewhere in the middle. Present all your receipts/TR slips, together with your passport and a credit card. Very important - the name in passport and name in credit card MUST be the same. You cannot do claim if names are different. After they processed, you will get CASH for all refund value in your receipts. They will stamp CASH PAID at all receipts and return to you. At the Airport, you still need to present these receipts at Custom. Custom will stamp ALL GOODS EXPORTED on these receipts and NOT return to you. Custom will passed these stamped receipts back to Global Blue. IMPORTANT- if you do not do this step at the airport, Global Blue will not get the custom stamped receipts, and your credit card will be charged the cash they have paid you plus 15% penalty fees. The advantage of getting cash at Myeongdong, you do not have to queue at Airport Refund Office (near Gate 28) to get your cash. Most of the time, the queue here is very long and you need to catch your flight. For Group 2 receipts/TR slips, you need to claim your cash at counter located at 2 Floor inside Olive and Young at Myeongdong. Ask the Global Blue staff for direction. Olive and Young is very near Woori Bank. Procedure is the same. Ensure names in passport is the same as in credit card. Please note that Global Blue accepts Master Card credit card but Global (the orange ones), does not accept Master Card. I had to use a VISA credit card here. For Group 3 receipts/TR slips, sadly you still need to claim your cash at the airport. Get the custom stamp on these receipts, and get cash from Refund Office near Gate 28. You would then say, 'might as well i do all at the airport'. Usually the handwritten receipts are not many (seems that my both purchases from ZARA gave me these types of TR slips). Even though I managed to get custom stamps on them, but the queue at Refund Office is too long - decided to pass them. For international flights, we still need to take the shuttle train to the other terminal for our flight. At least i have gotten the cash for the other two groups. Additional note: for those who are new at claiming tax refund, what you can do is to pack all shopping items that you are claiming tax refund in one bag. Once you reached the airport, you check in first (as per normal). But inform the check in staff that you have tax refund item in one of your check in bags. They will processed this bag (like the rest), stick on the baggage label, and return the bag to you. You need to bring this bag together with you to the custom to get your custom stamp. Custom may or may not ask you to open the bag. Once you got the custom stamp, deposit your bag at the oversized baggage counter which is next to the custom counter. Phew! Hope this help. Happy shopping !!!!"
shop shop shop and eat,"this is the shopping heaven in seoul and my family loves walking around the area.many shops selling korean food (i love the seaweed crackers!!), many shops to get souvenirs too at reasonable price.great atmosphere too.we went during winter, it was freezing cold but there were still many people.a must go in seoul !!!"
"Great place to shop, and eat","some of the sales staff very impolite no patience. Some of the people are very rude, especially older one they have no sense of courtesy, they just knock on you, just don't bother to say excuse me."
One-stop shopping for all,"Instead of scouring so many malls for different things, this is the one-stop place to get most if not all of your shopping needs. Food and drinks outlets are aplenty too. It's street shops so the atmosphere is also exhilarating rather than be inside a building."
Shopping Paradise!,"Not to be missed when you visit Seoul. Many cosmetic shops, almost one every 5 stores away. Clothes, accessories, bags, and many more! All women will love this place. Once I stepped into a cosmetic store, I would definitely come out with an additional bag! :)Besides shopping, there are also many restaurants. Korean food, Japanese food, Chinese food, western food, etc., you will not be short of choices. Try Myeongdong dumpling and Wangbijib BBQ. We loved it! There are also food stalls along the streets. Glad that we stayed 4 nights at Myeongdong :)"
HEAVEN.,"If i am given a chance to visit korea again, Myeongdong would be the only place i would shop. I did alot of retail damage while i was there, the place seems like magical place for me with lots of retailers from high end to low end. MOST, i repeat most of the high end items are way CHEAPER than Singapore. No negatives bout this place. Everything was awesomely great!"
"Not a shopper, but still enjoyed it","I took my girlfriend here when we arrived in Seoul and she loved it. We're not huge shoppers, but there is a lot to see and do in this area. Plenty of trendy stores and cafes in case you need a break. The shops are definitely geared towards females, but what shopping isn't? You can easily spend a few hours here. "
Shopping paradise,"This is the place where all women will go crazy as it is full of cosmetics products, clothes, etc. If you are a shopping king/queen, you will drop dead at this place"
Be prepared to spend money,"If you are a young girl or have a young daughter, this place is it for shopping. There are so many places to shop they have carts out on the streets selling clothes and gifts. It is not for tourist things, although there are a few shops that sell the stuff, this place if for fashion and young people.Bring along a loved one and you will drop $500 before you leave for the day. Moreover, that is just shopping for a few hours.My only complaint, the sizes run small and if you are a large girl, be prepared to be disappointed. The shops rarely carry large sizes."
A paradise for shoppers and foodie alike,"We came from the side Lotte department store and upon crossing the street your greeted with all the carts selling all sorts of products and also carts that sells different kind of food.Aside from the carts you find boutique stores that sells brand names products, cosmetics, branded food stores, to all kinds of bistro type food establishments .There is nothing to dislike here its paradise."
Beauty Care Products Shopping Madness,"First, wear a comfy pair of shoes and prepare yourself to have a long walk, because Myeongdong is a huge area full of interesting shops and stores. From Lotte Department Store, Lotte Department Store Avenuel (branded products such as LV, Gucci, Coach, Tods, Breitling, Rolex, etc.), Lotte Young Plaza (street fashion such us TOMS, Mango, Zara, Uniqlo, etc.), individual store of Mango, Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, Forever 21, to various brands of Korean beauty care products such as Face Shop, Innisfree, Nature Republic, Etude, Tony Moly, etc. I wasn't interested in fashion brands. Because I can find most of it back home in Jakarta, the collection and the price is very much the same. But I really couldn't resist the temptation of buying Korean beauty care products. They have wide range of hair, skin, face, everything you need to beautify your being. And they're not expensive! Good price for such quality. Each brand has 2 or more stores along Myeongdong area. So you don't have to be worry if you miss something to buy at the previous store. But, dont buy to much beauty products in a form of aerosol spray such as face mist. Because flight regulation only allow 1 bottle per bagage. It made me had to throw away one of my green tea mineral mist."
Crazy Busy Shopping,Great Shopping. Tons and tons of people though. If you don't like crowds this is not the place for you. Great shopping experience. Great street food. Lots of cool things for sale.
"Girls paradise, lads boredom","After visiting with my wife, I realised that nearly everything in Seoul catered for girls, you can't look one way without seeing flocks of women and flocks of make up stores, my wife of course was happy, I was bored stiff, the most exiciting part was the food stalls for me. In a nutshell this place is perfect for girls and it's the most dullest place for blokes."
A Place For Comestics Products,"A good place for shopping if you intend to get comestics and facial wash, the rest of it will tends to cost more than other locations. This place is over-crowded especially when it comes to weekends."
paradise for shoppers,a great place for shoppers and you can spend the whole day just at Myeongdong. A must visit when you come to Seoul. You can get everything here.
Not sure what all the hype is about???,"First of all, I am not a shopper at all so with that said, going here is a shoppers paradise. Actually, i felt like i was back in Japan with all the japanese tourists and most of the staff were multi-lingual and speaking to the Japanese tourists. I can understand that they want to sell to the Japanese but as a non-japanese i felt they really didnt want to sell to me. Its always crowded and the area is always packed from the time that the stores open until after dark. I guess if you are looking for some good bargins and things to bring back home. There are many other places less crowded and fun to see in Seoul."
MYeongdong,"shopping is endless. one could spend days exploring every alley of Myeongdong. Korean, Japanese, American, Indian Foods are all available. Food, Coffee, Clothes, Cosmetics and Brand names are available at Myeongdong at reasonable prices. Definately a MUST!"
shopping paradise for skin care and cosmetics,"Myeongdong is a shopping paradise for skin care and cosmetics. Well, enjoyed the street cart selling street food n knick knacks "
Shopping Heaven,"Nice to explore here and there are a lot goods with reasonable price, i don't mean branded goods :D It's nice to bargain for desirable prices. "
Shopping Haven,"Myeongdong is a shopping paradise for skin care and cosmetics. My girls went from shop to shop. Skin care and cosmetics are really cheap about 50% less than the price in Singapore. We love the atmosphere at night. For muslim travellers, there is a kebab stall near Ibis Myeongdong and it sells delicious turkish ice-cream. If you want more filling food, you may eat at Saffron Restaurant in Ibis Myeondong - delicious Arab meals. "
The Chandni Chowk of Seoul,"If you visit the Myeongdong area in Seoul, then you have really seen what Korea is all about. A multitude of people thronging the street at all times to partake of the wares being peddled is a sight to behold. The high and the mighty vie with the bourgeoning middle class for attention and the vendors don’t disappoint you. The elite brands of the world compete with the local brands a la David and Goliath. I love to see movies in a cinema hall and was thrilled to be sitting on an electronic chair which I could control myself to seek the best viewing position. The place is a veritable gold mine for foodies as all kinds of food is served. If you are adventurous, you could try the street vendors and sample real Korean food. A great experience but definitely no competition to the Chandni Chowk in New-Delhi!"
check out the local brands!,"personally, I like to check out local brands when I travel. beanpole, codes combine and SPAO are all located on the same street here. I deliberately made a separate visit on a sat morning before the shops opened and the streets were still fairly deserted, it was quiet and the alleys were beautiful, took some wonderful photos. "
Overwhelming Shopping Street!!,"Stayed in one of the hotel located @ Myeongdong in early December 2013, down the hotel is the busy bustling Myeondong shopping street. There are two subway station near to Myeongdong, one is Myeongdong Station on the south-end and Euljiro 1 Station on the north-end, both subway station sandwich Myeongdong Shopping streets in between, so you could shop from one end to the other end without returning for the same subway station.Shops are mainly selling cosmetic, beauty products, fashions & eateries too. You could find all the Korean local brands here, for eg. Face Shop, Tony Moly, Innisfree, Etude, Missha, Laneige & many many more... Price is approximately 30-40% cheaper compare to our home country (Malaysia). All shops are very generous on giving away free samples.The street getting very busy at night especially during weekend. Shops start to close after 11pm but still many eateries open 24 hours, so need not worry if you are hungry after a crazy shopping night."
"Shopping, eating and buying cosmetics","A very busy shopping area with lots of brand names (Holika Holika, Face shop, Tony Moly) and department stores ( Lotte, Migliore, Uniqlo etc.) concentrated in one place. Lots of street food stalls, cafes and restaurants. It can get crowded with tour groups. Plan accordingly."
Must visit for shopaholic,Lots of store with fast paced people around. Must visit if you are really a shopaholic since so many international and local stores here.
"heaven for girls, and maybe guys!","A shopper's paradise! It's a huge area and you wouldn't be able to cover the whole area in a day. You'll be getting samples from beauty shops which are present in every corner. Lots of street food, worth tasting. However, it can get a little too crowded at times. Enjoy!"
Interesting.,Many streets and push cart stalls.Many eateries and variety of shops.TONS of facial products shop.More expensive than other areas.Crowded.
Nice local shopping district,"Mainly selling cosmetics and small fraction dealing with sporting apparel. Environment setting is nice, and also local cafes are also nice place for a coffee."
More shopping and dining ...,"Nice shopping area, a good mix of departmental stores as well as street shops and stalls. Very crowded. Main attraction for me was the street food, as well as many Korean eateries all around."
Shopping & Eating overload!,"Loved this area, all you can do is shop and eat and IT IS AMAZING!! Talk about bright lights, big city! We literally went from one beauty shop to another, and another and another... almost never ending. We love love love InnisFree and Etude House! Amazing product and really great material used. "
Very busy crowded but very fun and interesting!,"Busy and crowded in a good way! Like what some people said earlier, its very easy to get lost but its good. There are lots of food to eat, shops doing discounts and basically you can get most of the trendy stuff here. I was Seoul for a long weekend so I experienced Friday-Tuesday nights. I would think its very interesting to go on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Street food/stalls don't close till very late and still so crowded at 1~2am. On weeknights, its generally/normally quiet with street food/stalls starting to close at around 11pm.Plenty of restaurants to choose from. As a guy who don't like shopping, the deals was so good that you'd feel so guilty for not buying any. I went during end Nov and early December (Black Friday) and many shops were doing 50% discounts. During the day time is busy but definitely not as busy as Friday-Sunday nights. Definitely recommend to visit this and won't make you regret!"
Great place for lively atmosphere,"When in Seoul, you definitely need to visit Myeongdong!There are lots and lots of shops as well as little stalls in the middle of the walkway which sells a variety from food snacks to souvenirs,gloves, bags etcI visited Myeondong twice during my stay in Seoul, go in the evenings and you might find a group offering Free Hugs!If you want to buy CDs, this is the place as well and really good price for the KPop cds which cost double at Incheon airport departure hallCrowded but fun!"
get lost in the crowd,"for the shoppers, this place will be like heaven. but it's far way too crowd for me. the shopping area is very wide, so many people, and there are soo many thing sold, that un-shopper people like me will easily get lost. i need like 1 hour to find my way back to the subway station. and the irony was, i didn't even buy a thing except 3 pairs of socks in that gigantic shopping site. if you love crowd, fashion, cosmetics, you really should go there, and spend hours to shop."
good place to find cheap skin product,You can choice from many brand of skin care product and cosmetic. I went here to buy some kPOP album for my friends. highly recommended for shoppers!
Shopping,Shopping is shopping and I would prefer to do it somewhere with less people. The new Uniqlo store has alarge selection though and if you want to see crowds they are here.
A Shoppers & Dining Paradise,"This area compose of a few alleys which is transformed in theevenings with push carts selling snacks,clothes,shoes,bric-bracs etcThere are also numerous stores,including top internationalbrands, & restaurants in these lanes,alleysYou will be spoilt for choice for shopping & dining.There are many western & international restaurants there too.Please remember that many stores have a few branches in the Myeoung-dong shopping district.Korean comestics are now well-known in Asia and the ladiesmake a bee line for the various top quality Korean brands. One tip is ask for a tax receipt for purchases over 30,000 won in onereceipt & you can obtain tax refund in the tax refund outlet or at the Airport.With the large influx of mainland China tourists, most sales assistantscan converse in mandarin.It is also advisable to fix a meeting point (eg, a cafe ?) & time for yourparty as most will be too engrossed in their shopping & get seperated from each other !"
shopping and entertainment in a walk,"This area is full of restaurants shops, street merchants. Many of the stores provide musical entertainment on stages in the street.The energy of the many young people that frequent Myeondong (Mong dong) is contagious. There is a beautiful church on the fringe, as well as the Chinese embassy. Great section of knock-off items, as well as the real deal at stores like Burberry. You will have a great experience for the cost of a subway ride!"
Lots of shops in this area!,"Visited Myeongdong for the first time. There were thousands of people and hundreds of shops, way to many little alleys and shops to visit in one day. If you are in South Korea and need Christmas Decorations this is the place to go. There were lots of Christmas shops."
Ultimate Shopping Heaven,"Fantastic shopping heaven and good authentic Korean restaurants. You are find skincare shops like Laneige,Etude,Innispree,etcRestaurants like hotpot,hotplace, grill meat or even fastfood can be found through out Myeongdong. Recommend to try out the Anthony Spicy chickena and Lotteria Fast food."
Shopping for girls,this is the shopping heaven for girl. pricing is not really cheap. but however there is a lot of boutique shop over here. as well as renowned fashion brand. 
An outside shopping centre.,All the big brands are here you can think of. You have all the western shops and the asian shops. It is really busy with lots of people going there to shop/hang out. You can walk down the street and try street food. You can get traditional Korean food along this stretch of road.Easily accessible from the Metro
Cosmetic shopping and street food heaven,"This is the 'to go' place for cosmetic shopping. Every skin mask available is here. Every Korean Cosmetic line is on every corner. I saw at least 3 of everything. I've only been a couple times at night, so I'm not sure how it is during the day...but at night it is busy.There are vendors set up in the middle of the street selling socks and snacks. Every souvenir can be found here. It is also located very close to the mall. The best thing about the cosmetic shopping is all the free product that you get with purchase (or even without a purchase). I stocked up on lip gloss, masks, and of course....SOCKS."
For the love of shopping!,"Myeongdong was great! All the Korean cosmetics stores like Skin Food, Banila Co. Etude House etc were all beside each other. It was such a treat especially because they were having some promotions. International brands such as h&m and Zara were also there. There are a lot of restaurants and street food around so you will never go hungry after a day of shopping. I'm already excited for my next trip to Seoul!"
great cosmetic products,i first got quite cycnical about the brands which i had never heard about and only bought a few facial masks. i was not too satistified about the masks but the various creams that i was given for trial were more than perfect. i wish i can go back soon to buy the shops out. :)
"If you love shopping, it's a must to visit!","If you love shopping, pls don't miss Myeongdong. You can find everything there from cosmetic to souvenir. Almost of korean cosmetic brands are located there as well as famous clothing brands. However, if you wanna shop high end brands, you can cross the street to Shinsegae or Lotte shopping malls. Also you can find many good restaurants & convenient stores around."
Hotspot,"This area is the reason most people travel to Seoul. Shopping, dining and walking. Crowded every single day!"
Perfect place if you want to shop,"This place wasn't really for me, but a paradise if you are with your other half. They have many many stores here and ghetto big Lotte department store as well"
Myeongdong - for shopping and good food,Stayed at a hotel in Myeongdong for a one night two days stop over at Seoul. Good place to shop and there are many places for good food. I cannot type in Korean here. There is a nice eating place I would like to recommend. Please view the attached pic for the location of this eating place located in Myeongdong. Good food and value for money - reasonable pricing. Had 2 meals in the day - brunch and dinner.
Very good shopping,"This shopping complex was opposite our hotel. Full of good shops during the day and in the evening, there are also many stalls selling very varied items. In the Myeongdong metro, there are also excellent selection of shops."
Crowded with Mainland Chinese tourist,"Myeongdong was okay. It is very similar to the Causeway Bay in Hong Kong. I guess some people shop until they drop but to me, is nothing special. However, it is always good to see new things. I am impressed with how well the Koreans can speak Mandarin which is obvious that they are very well prepared for the Mainland Chinese tourists. "
Girls would definitely love this,"They say Namdaemun is the cheapest place to shop?! I say just go to Myeongdong and they're the same. Cosmetics, bags, shawls, shoes and clothes are everywhere. You'll enjoy how cheao the goods are with very good quality. But if you plan to buy something for a guy, it'll be a hard time. Plan ahead I say and walk to the center part of the market. Try to remember where you found the item with the lowest price and come back to that after checking out a few more stores with the same item."
Korean Cosmetics Center,"Based on some bloggers and reviewer, Myeongdong is a must visit shopping area or at least you have to know like what Myeongdong is.I didn't have much time in Seoul ( 4 days only) so I went to Myeongdong with purpose to buy Nature Republic and got more samples here, but it did not happened .... so I suggested just go to any cosmetic store anywhere if you didn't have much time, it would give same amount of samples. In myeongdong I tried street snack Walnut and bought a Korean stamp (bargain for it!). Many restaurants, stores and stands sells anything.. so it always crowded."
Walking in Circles,"I stayed in Myeongdong and certainly did a lot of shopping there. It is fantastic for free samples and the competition between the stores is huge so often there are sales. The late night shopping is also great too, everything is normally closed by 10pm and the shops are only open late on some nights. Check out my blog post on my time there. http://rememberthefirst.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/myeongdong-명동-seoul-south-korea-what-to-do-a-review/"
If you want to shop this is the place for you.,"There's everything in Myeongdong from the big chains like H&M, Forever 21, Gap and the like to the Korean street sellers with shoes and scarves on the cheap. A great place to head to early though as it's popular and later in the day it's a lot of bumping into fellow shoppers."
Its Christmas every day!,"There is an unmistakable festive spirit in Myeong Dong - every day. I was there on a Sunday evening and thought that it was because of the weekend. However, I was there on a Tuesday again, and found the place packed with youngsters, and the same kind of holiday ambience.Essentially a market full of cosmetic shops and High end fashion stores.Prices are a bit higher than Namdaemun market. The fun here is in getting something to eat from a cart on the street and walking around."
Shopping area...,"Myeongdong is basically a place to shop. There are many malls, shops, restaurants, etc. in that area. You can easily spend hours there shopping. and when you are tired, just find a cafe to sit and rest, and when hungry, just find a place to eat.One of the things I like about Myeongdong is the street food. As you shop along the streets, you will encounter pushcarts selling street food - don't miss tasting the culture of Seoul. There are spicy rice cakes, fish cake, pan fried red bean pastry, cuttlefish, to name a few.You will also find many local and international brands represented in this shopping area."
Heaven for Shopper,"Lots of store, definitely heaven for a heavy shopper. You can find Etude House and other Korean Cosmetic Brand Store almost in every corner of Myeongdong, and also other branded store such as Mango, H&M, LV, etc. "
People People,"A great destination if you can handle the crowds, they are everywhere !Good shopping if you have patience and people tolerance :)"
Myeong Dong equals shopping,"This is a compact shopping area covering a few blocks within the Jung-gu district with a nice mix of lower end shopping and upscale malls reminiscent of Hong Kong's Causeway Bay with a bit of Mongkok thrown in. Overall this makes for a less chaotic scene and though crowded, still easily navigable and a fairly pleasant territory. There's plenty to see for browsers and shoppers alike as this area is chock-full of shops and stalls selling clothes, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, trinkets and whatnot. Meanwhile there are also many restaurants, cafes and food kiosks for taking breaks from all the walking. Of course, signature labels abound in Shinsegae, Lotte Department Store and the like. Just across is a good concentration of shops selling low to mid-priced merchandise while the range of goods include local items to internationally recognized brands. While it may still be cheaper to purchase in nearby Namdaemun Market, Myeong Dong has a fun and vibrant atmosphere and many shops stay open late in the evenings. Also, for those who get anxious with bargaining, prices are fixed here, and most sellers encountered were not pushy. For clothes, it appears standard for the small shops to not allow fitting, even for outerwear or clothes about USD50 and above. This includes some fancier local shops with better quality goods and higher prices. Tips on Shopping. As a rule, it's good to look around before buying; occasionally there are items that are more expensive in the kiosks than in the stores! Visitors intent on finding good deals might also benefit visiting Namdaemun Market first.Tip on Foreign exchange. There are many foreign currency exchange points in Myeong Dong offering pretty good rates. For instance, KRW1060=USD1 (XE rate quote of KRW1071=USD1). Note that Lotte Dept Store offers forex at the 7/F but the rates found were not as favorable and they also require passport for this transaction.Overall, Myeong Dong is geared for shoppers while curious browsers will find enough to keep them occupied for a good hour here. Other attractions in the area include the Cooking Nanta show, while Korea's National Treasure No. 1 - Namdaemun Gate, N Seoul Tower and other major tourist sights are also within walking distance. The Myeong Dong area (and Jung-gu) makes a great base for travelers as they are centrally located for sightseeing and shopping."
The Premier Shopping Area in Seoul,"If you go to Asia, each country has their premier shopping area. In Tokyo, it's Ginza. Singapore, it's Orchard Road, The Philippines it's Ayala Glorietta and in Korea, it's Myeongdong. Anyway, if you go here, you'll find everything from the big department stores, to the small street vendors selling trinkets, phone cases and street food (among others). Of particular note, there are two Zaras, Uniqlo, Forever 21 Men/Women, H&M, SPAO (a very good Korean clothing chain), Muji (at the Lotte Young World), ABC Mart (shoes), as well as other local fashion and cosmetic chains. Speaking of cosmetics, my sister and mother swear by Nature Republic but there are other local cosmetic chains in the area as well. I should also add, that if you are looking for glasses, there is a shop in the subway where the optician speaks English. Look for the subway entrance next to the Bank Of Korea Museum. Go down the stairs and his shop is right next to the entrance. He should have a sign saying he speaks English/Japanese. You will not be disappointed...I bought 5 pairs of glasses, high index lenses for 150 dollars - all made in an hour! You can't get that kind of service in an hour let alone for 150 dollars! If you need alterations done, there is an alteration shop in the Noon Square Building...unfortunately, the ladies there don't speak too much English so if you can, try to have some Korean phrases handy for what you want done so as to avoid any mis-communication. I had 8 pairs of pants hemmed, done in 2 hours and I paid 32 dollars (4 dollars per pant!). You can't get same day service in the States at ANY price let alone 4 dollars. It seems like we pay more in the States and get far, far less!"
you'll never go wrong with Myeongdong shopping!,Myeongdong is Seoul's shopping mecca for tourists and locals alike. People never get tired of going through the alleys and sifting though the shops to find good deals and stuff on sale. 
Daebak!,So many stores for so many people with so many shopping needs. Awesome! And many choices of restaurants and delicious street food !
Myeongdong is a must go in Seoul,"I stayed at Prince Hotel which is directly opposite the Myeongdong street. Full of shopping and eateries. It is also within walking distance to Lotte Departmental Store where you can get all the duty free items upstairs. There are a few eateries that you must try in Myeongdong such as the Ginseng Chicken soup, Korean Style BBQ and Korean Style Fried Chicken. There are many more there which I have not got the chance to try due to my small appetite which is something that I regret. If you in Korea for cosmetic shopping, Myeongdong is also a place for you because it is full of their local cosmetic shop such as Etude House, Nature Republic, Clio, Skin Food etc.Definitely a regret if you are in Seoul and did not visit Myeongdong."
"Hyper shopping, indeed!","This area was very lively! For our trip to Seoul last week, we decided to stay in the Grand Hotel Myeongdong, located smacked down in the hustle bustle of Myeongdong. What a perfect choice! Restaurants, shops, Nanta Theather, shopping malls, convenience stores and subway stations were all within easy reach. Did not shop much other than cosmetics here because the fashion were aimed towards younger market. We did a lot of dining, though. Myeongdong offers great variety of food. You could even try a very good sannakji (live octopus sashimi) and bamboo rice in this area."
"Large area, crowded everyday, best experience of shopping","I've spent more than 3 hr there. Very large area, complete!!I even could found Korean album which not yet sell in IndonesiaThere are plenty of cosmetics tenant, and they give us lot of samples.You may experience great shopping here, especially at night.Don't forget to try massage in Myeongdong."
Facial Products,Facial Brand Stores products less expensive than the Face Brand Products sold in U.S.A. The store gave samples of their products if you made a purchase
"Cosmetics, cosmetics and cosmetics","As per title, you can get them at much cheaper price as compared to my country. There are a lot of street foods too. If you are looking at clothes, GoToMall at express bus terminal or ewha womens university."
Festive!!!,"Go there after office hours, huge crowd and lots of delicious street food like mayonnaise grilled chicken on skewer and spiral fried potatoes wrapped around a hotdog on skewer too! Bargain with the street hawkers."
Myeongdong shopping district,"I loved the Myeongdong shopping district. I went there twice, one time was during the afternoon & the other time was during the night. I even reached the Lotte department store (the main store) in Myeongdong area which is next to the Lotte Hotel. it is defiantly worth visiting."
Great shopping for the below 30s,"IMO, the ambience and retail mix at Myeongdong is great for the hyper 30s and below. Most of the fashion wear and goods there are locally made and they tend to look similar after a couple of streets. I gave up asking if the bags and boots are made of real leather because they just aren't, yet the prices are not cheap for a non-genuine or non-leather product. If you have teens, they would love it there. Nevertheless there are quite a number of small eateries - I am happy with my Ginseng Chicken even though I did not manage to buy anything from Myeongdong."
good place to shop,"A lot of things to buy here. Just make sure to go around first before settling in one shop to buy. Every 100 meters lie beauty shops next to each other, it's crazy! Money changers are also on every corner."
crazy and fun place,"My daughter just love Myeongdong. People watching, eating, shopping, How anybody not like the place! That is why we always stay in hotels near Myeongdong. At least it saves taxi fares to get there."
Nice outdoor shopping area,"Really nice outdoor shopping area, busy and crowded in the afternoons. Nice stores all around and good finds! "
a shopping paradise ~,in the first place i was quite skeptical about myeong dong as i find that perhaps the price here is higher than the other locations. But i was wrong. Everything was more or less the same...and they have weekend sales ~ The beauty of myeong dong is really colourful and crowded with the young and olds. It is really a cosmetic paradise.
"Love this place, a shopping paradise.","Shopping, shopping, shopping + restaurants. Heaven for those who like to shop. Very crowded, but for a reason. Full of Asian shopping at the cosmetics stores. Great deals and discounts for all kinds of shopping whether it is Korean and Western shoe stores, clothes or cosmetic stores. There are at least 2 H&M's which I shopped at. Love all the body shops such as Face Shop, Holika Holika, Skin, Skin Food, Tony Molly, Aritaum etc. You should definitely visit for some great deals and wonders for your body and skin. Lots of great restaurants with local Korean food, Chinese, Japanese, and Western. Lots of street food ranging from local snacks to Turkish Wraps, to sweets, to fruit. A few hotels within the Myeongdong Shopping area. Currently staying at J Hill hotel. I really, really enjoy coming back to Myeondong whenever I'm in Seoul."
Shopping heaven,Almost every brand has 3stores at least arround those streets. Wt u thunk of ....u can buy there in the most reasonable price (i bought the same earing 4 times cheaper there)
Cosmetics Heaven,"I love Myeongdong.. its cosmetics heaven, and i just like seating outdoor and people watch. almost all young people are there. You can see a glimpse of Seoul Life in Myeongdond, although its always crowded."
place for shopaholic,"This is the heaven for shopaholic ! you can found easily from fashion to cosmetic ! i feel in the past view year Korea became a mecca for make up and caring product for Asia and also for plastic surgery for sure :) many poster with beauty skin in all over this place :p also the funny thing is in this place they have the Biggest Uniqlo store in Asia, considering the brand is the most successful Japanese fashion, street food and cake is the best to try here, seem more clean than in namdaemun market, this place open till late so don't worried if you have busy day :) Korea is always offer shop heaven in many corner of Seoul :) so just be there and get the vibe :)"
I love it!,"This is the place that i would like to return in Seoul, for shopping and having meals. Since there's a lot of cosmetic shops in here, so you can compare and choose whatever cosmetic you like in short distance. There are various types of restaurant, and street foods."
ONCE NEVER ENOUGH!,"OMG! this is my favorite place.. yes once is never enough.. i just go to myongdong 4 times.. so addicted! buying so many stuffs, cosmetics and also eating and drinks korean snack street! i like it!! i will miss crowded in myeongdong! when im back to korea again! i will go to myeongdong again! again! and again! i love it! this is girl town!! heavenly!!!"
great place to walk trough,"A lot of shops, young people, good vibration, also find something to take with you or to eat , easy to get there by subway..."
Beauty street,Very fashionable... full of beauty products. Try the local brands as it is cheaper than the imported brands like body shop which is priced the same in Manila. Has a lot of bargains but signs showing a 50 off is only for members. Etude gives a 30% discount to tourists. There is a coach outlet in one alley that is priced cheaper than hongkong.
"A Place to Dine,Shop and Relax","They've got everything here: shopping, dining, etc. but the most popular are cosmetics shops selling the latest BB,CC creams and beauty products.The shops normally open around 10 am and the outdoor food market starts as soon as its dark normally around 6-7 pm. Its an exciting market at night since everyone just strolls around to do some shopping and eating."
Crazy Shopping,Plenty of things to buy from clothes to shoes to makeups to masks. You'll never run out of things to do. Eat from push carts. Fight through the throngs of crowd. Sit down & relax in a cafe. It's never boring here.
Flee market,"You can actually skip it.. Waste of time. Try the mall really better than wasting your energy and time, theres actually nothing so good to see or an xtra ordinary to get amused or amazed.. Hope point taken"
A bustling mini metropolis,"Myeongdong is definitely the place to be for active nocturnals who love shopping with an undeterred passion. Myeongdong... Hip bubbly Korean music blaring from unknown sources... iridescent neon lights from above that seem to change in vibrancy at various distances. What more can I say? Although It's as beautiful as any man-made city can be, it exudes an air of excellence in its trendiness, making it a basic Mecca for shoppers. A definite and infinite yes where its complexion at night will undoubtedly evoke a series of 'oohs' and 'aahs'. A must also is to try the 32 inch or whatever ice-cream... just sayin'."
Overwhelming but the same,"On the cool side at night all the lights are really neat, and non-stop huge crowds gives it a ton of energy. Downside is this is just veneer and after a tad wandering becomes same old same old unless you are specifically seeking to shop for the limited range the area has - cosmetics and clothes, not much else."
Pack your skincare/cosmetic home 一次買齊化妝保養品,"if you wanna buy mass brand skin care products, then don't miss this place.整條明洞大街主街琳瑯滿目的開架化妝品保養品品牌任你挑選，一次買齊；巷弄內有很多小店販售當季流行服飾，值得一逛。"
Skin care Products,I stay in Myeongdong area for 4 days. There are too many shops around Myeongdong. There are many skincare shops around. Look for shop with discount. Same brand name can have different price when in discount. Be sure to look around for shop having discount.
Lovely Shopping Area,"Fashionable clothing stores. There is H&M, ZARA, Top Ten. A lot of low-end skin care lines etc the face shop, innisfree "
Get all my stock of cosmetics & skincare here,"Love the variety of cosmetic and skincare brands available here, just have to stock up before my next visit to Seoul. Love the atmosphere and energy of the crowd and lots of shops that sells interesting things. However, I dislike some of the customer service especially the Chinese-speaking salesgirls who try to get me to buy more stuff and give me the dirty look when I just want to test and browse. Well, anyway, since there are so many stores, I will just leave and go into another. Nevertheless, love the place."
Past its prime,"I went there a few times, a few years back. THis time, due to the tourist influx, the prices hiked and rapid structures of international brands start to rise. Robbing myeongdong of its once quaint, cheap shopping and good street food. Everywhere you go, you hear foreign languages spoken by the store keepers. It does not feel like part of Korea."
Great shopping and food,"A place where we observed the culture of seoul younger generation today , there were great restaurants and especially interesting are the stalls along the street , while in the midst of some famous shops. Great place to shop for korean cosmetic products , spoil for choice.We love it as it was relaxing just strolling and looking at the shops and stall and sitting at the opened concepts coffee cafe watching the world pass by."
Endless shopping streets...,"Endless shopping streets with countless comestic shops, restaurants, accessories, street vendors that operates till 11am. Spending even a full day here is not enough so plan plenty of time to spend here or best is to stay in this area. "
Shop till you drop,"Myeongdong is a shopper,s haven, everything is there, branded clothes, shoes, cosmetics, food, souvenir items. There were so many alleys, that we got lost and could not find where we were supposed to exit"
shopping heaven,shopping heaven for the shopaholic. various clothes and accessories to suit every budget. the street food is not bad too.
never sleeping market,"its seems like 24 hours market, more late nite more crowded, too much variety inside, really nice to walking around in that area late nite. tourist, most of the stores like others in Seoul are cosmetics stores. they will keep attract you inside. really enjoy this market ambiance :) if you asked me the prices.. all here are so expensive.. recommended for market ambiance only. you wont get bored, and one more thing, you can find Mc Donald and KFC in this market :) enjoy!"
Excellent for Shopping!,"Everything from cosmetics, to the detailed accessory shops, is found here. For a first-timer in Korea, i suggest that you better go to a small shops where a lot of girls are rummaging clothes, this is where the cheapest and cutest dress that you can find. Famous clothes shops are also found here such as F21, H&M, Zara and a lot more. It's heaven for female shoppers. You can even jump from one shop to another since the place is compact. Most of the bigger shops is expensive such as Jill Stuart, so it's a no-no if you guys/girls have a tight budget. The weekend is the busiest since most of the shop has its own sale, so meaning more sale, more people. Enjoy window shopping, but i assure you, its better to have an extra few bucks, i dont think window shopping is enough."
Just more expensive stores!,"Although it was fun watching the opening of the stores, very formal and they even brought out tea 10 minutes before (free!) for the masses waiting. These are just very expensive stores. I can buy most of these products at home (in the US) for the same price or less, and I can also purchase most from the duty free catalog for less. Just feel like Korea is no longer a shopping destination for us! Fun to go since the crowds are made up of a lot of attractive people! (very stylish and well dressed)"
great shops with lots of love cafe!!,My nieces head down almost everyday to the street... either for a cuppa or just to walk and window shop or have a hotdog!!! Most of the shop assistants speak Mandarin!!
Makes your backpacking trip becomes a shopping trip,"Sigh. This place really ruins my tight budget. With endless cosmetics stores, variety clothing, shoes, bags, etc etc stores, cafes, how can you not end up spend more than you initially planned? End up coming almost every night before going back to our guesthouse (Namsan Guesthouse) which is very near to the shopping place. Not only to shop but just looking around (window shopping). Bought cool bagpacks, cute stocking, korean merchandise, nice cloths, cosmetics, etc etc. A must go for ladies (!), a should go for men(? Well you can find cool shoes, bags, etc. lol)."
Clothes and cosmetics,"If you ever visit Seoul, Myeong Dong must be in your agenda, especially if you are a lady. There are endless clothing and cosmetics stores. Even if you don't like shopping (like 99% of men...) you can still find some very interesting shops here, like cat cafe, various restaurants.Btw, almost all stores have staffs speaking Chinese now so a big plus for Chinese speaking visitors."
miss this place so bad T_T,"this place is so awesome, when i come back to my country, feel like want to go to myeondong back, n just leisure around..the price not that cheap, but it is better rather than hongik area, and you can find everything here :D "
Shopping Haven,My original plan was just to visit it once - ended up visiting it almost every night (we stayed opposite the main street). Lots of food to choose (especially at night) and many shops to visit. 
Very Crowded,Great for shopping & food. Great if you are looking to buy skincare as there are many many skincare shops along all the lanes. It can get very noisy and crowded with many tourists. Go in the afternoon or evening when there are more stalls set up along the streets. Try the many variety of street food for a taste of Korea. Most sales assistants in this area speaks English and Chinese. 
Shopping and food haven,"This place has it all. It has tonnes of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, shoes and of course food. It is a must go destination if you are visiting Seoul. Good place to stay as well as it is easier to get to other parts of Seoul."
Shopping paradise!,"Great for shopping, food and finding pretty good bargains. Easily accessible by Metro and bus and close to other attractions nearby. Would recommend trying out the ""snack food"" from the vendors, and if you are travelling here in the summer try out the Green Tea ice cream at O'Sulloc that is sold right outside the store. K-pop fans will want to check out the music stores that sell all kinds of idol memorabilia. Great place to shop for cosmetics!!!"
A must visit!,truly a memorable shopping experience for me when i visited this place during winter. It's located nearby to dongdaemon market the other shopping haven. As a lady who love to shop for items like handbags & skincare products for very reasonable price this is the right place to be!
Shop till you drop,Fantastic for females. So many cheap shops selling everything a woman could need. Endless beauty shops.Also great if you're a K-pop fan as there are many K-pop stores selling everything from CD's to mugs.Very busy but still able to look around.Lotte store and Lotte Young Plaza are also here and well worth a look.
Shop till you drop,"You can get just about anything here. If you have a limited time in Seoul, this is probably the best place to go shopping. You will also find many restaurants there serving all kind of food."
shopping for clothes and cosmetics,"I liked the night market,it is the place to buy cosmetics and clothes. Seaweed is cheap there, too. But dislike to be ther during summer"
"If you want to shop in Korea, go here.","Just like Osaka's Shinsaibashi, Myeongdong is Seoul's national shrine for shopping. If you're looking for K-pop paraphernalia, Korean fashion labels, Korean cosmetics and brand name stuff, this is the place to go. Streets are covered so you can shop without worrying about the sun or rains. Some shops and restaurants open late in the afternoon and throughout the night. The district is conveniently located being a few subway stops from Gyeongbukgung and Seoul Station."
Beauty products haven.,"Probably all the popular Korean beauty product brands are at this location. Most, if not all the shops have Chinese-speaking staff so be prepared to for loud and uncouth tourist from Mainland China."
Hassle shopping,I don't really fancy this place as it is too crowded and the non english speaking sellers are not helping most of the time. Just like petaling street in Malaysia with better choices. I gave up in bargaining.
Retail insanity--shopping is a contact sport!,"If you love to shop and people watch, this is the place. From the amazing luxury department stores to department stores for kids to the street market on Saturday night, this place was jumping! The crowd was friendly and they say to watch for pickpockets but we had no problems. Lots of street food and entertainment and August is a month-long sale event so go in the evening when its cooler and be prepared for an experience unlike any other."
Love this one!,"OMG!.. I can spend the whole day here just to browse the area and could not get enough of it. it was only on our third night we stay in the hotel near to this place and I was so amaze with the shop, restaurant and much more. The shop is more to middle range brand such as Zara, Uniqlo and for Korean cosmetic all are available here. They also have people which I believe from tourism dept who help tourist and hand out the area map as well helping to translate... overall was good experience ^^"
shop and eat,"great place for shopping for make up , accesories, shoes and clothes and try yummy street food ,muuuuust visit"
Great but can get pricey....,"It's great for casual strolls and few quick gifts, but clothing shopping is priced at or above retail. The underground also has some nice things in it too....."
Spend the entire day here,"You could spend a whole day here shopping like crazy and not see it all. So after a few hours I got pretty thirsty and we stepped into a good little cafe/restaurant. There are so many good ones to choose from and all reasonably priced. I wish I could have remembered the name of this one. Anyway after 5 beers and 4 bottles of makkoli the two of us stumbled out and then had to try some of the street food - notably those delicious deep fried chicken skewers. So for those of us not interested in shopping all day with our significant other, there are some other more enjoyable options to occupy yourself with while the ladies are running around all day. Just make sure you make an easy to find rendezvous spot because this area is huge."
Shopping heaven,"With shops like F21 and Zara and local brands like SPAO, its a shopping heaven there. I would recommend visiting during late afternoon as the streets start coming alive with street vendors at night. Visit the fixed shops in the day and visit the street shops at night. "
Lots of shops and street food!,"If you are in Seoul then you got to visit Myeongdong, its the central spot for shopping! Most of the shops are, cloths, shoes and cosmetics. From the global brands you will have there a huge ZARA and H&M stores plus lots of local stores with a huge choice on cosmetics.There are a lot of restaurants which makes it a good place to hang out around dinner time and watch the locals have fun after their work day. Most people around speak English as this is one of the top tourist spots. Also most of the street food sold here is very funny and weird in a way but tasty to eat!"
Good quality products,You can not only shopping but dinner. Food and national and European. There are clothes and Souvenirs. Cheap socks. Show Nantes. Cafe cats and dogs.
loved it!,"Loved loved loved this place!!! H&m,zara , forever 21 to name a few with some shops including forever 21 opened from midnight until 10PM.These shops had western sizes and were massive!if you live here like me this is an absolute find!"
Shopping Mecca,There are tons of shops and a wide array of clothing and other merchandise. It can get crowded and you should be prepared to walk. I just enjoyed looking around and checking out the products on display.
WOW,The amount of shopping that can be done is amazing. I happen to love shoes and enjoyed all the different styles available. 
a place to find everything...,"if u're looking for something... u can definately find it here but expect to have it at tourist prices...Street food changes as the season changes but there are a few must tries::- Keranbbang (egg bread)- Hotdog with fries on it.- Grilled Squid- Grilled Chicken Skewer w leek- Kamja Tang (Potato Soup) is not bad too... along the row of SPAO and after Uniqlo...*SPECIAL MENTION:: - Seek out the Cat Cafe if u're a feline lover... its off the main street in the alley between BSX and New Balance. Currently above Onitsuka Tiger. Its abt 8,000won- 12,000won for a drink and u can stay as long as u like. Ask for ""kan-shik""(snacks) @2,000won to feed the cats!- check out and compare prices even if its between the same brands!!! seek out the shops off the main alley, they tend to give more freebies =D"
super market place,"This is an excellent market place to buy shirts, shoes and what not. The price are listed so it is not that the seller chooses his own price based on the customer walking in. You can negotiate 10 percent discount if the value of the purchase is over 10,000"
was there almost everyday,"no matter how many touristy shopping places ive been to. i kept coming back to this place. lots of places to check out to shop. lots of coffee shops. you may get lost at first but once you are there for almost every other day like me, you can find your way perfectly. reminds me a bit of shibuya center area and harajuku. it can be pretty mad and chaotic. stores open at around 11:30 mostly. "
Shopping has never been so fun!,"If you go to Seoul and miss Myeongdong, then you have missed out! The neighborhood comprises narrow alley ways, lined with shops on either side. These feature an assortment of clothing, accessories, trinkets....you name it. And to boot, the prices are far reduced from what the malls are charging. Definitely worth a half day if you are a serious shopper and you are looking for bargains. Expect big crowds, especially where local celebrities make an appearance. It's quite the affair!"
Paradise for shopperholic,It is a massive place filled with ppl. I bought some skincare products for my wife. There are many restaurant and cafes nearby. The feeling of sitting inside a cafe watch ppl outside shopping like crazy is very interesting. The foods and drinks here are very nice!
GO!,"Excellent shopping, eating and entertainment. There is an endless variety of restaurants and trendy shops. You can also find book stores and theaters. It is very crowded especially on the weekends but it is well worth visiting."
Hyper-Shopping for a reason,"Stayed in Sejong Hotel, and convenient accessible to MydeongDong. Best place to buy Korea branded cosmetic, skincare and clothes (with few made in China store) with reasonable price. Cosmetic and skincare were reasonable price with good givesaway and samples (after purchase). Polo Tee (at SPAO) and Pants (at Top Ten) could go as low as 9900won. Restaurant and Cafe could be found everywhere (dark alleys, first/second/third floor) which cost prob 30000 to 45000won for 3 persons sharing. Shops generally close at 10pm till 11pm (mostly), would recommend considering feet massage within the area after shops close.Instead of going to popular department stores (e.g Lotte Department Store) which probably costs >100000won for a simple item, it is more definitely worth shopping for bargain at MydeongDong. The quality of clothes is also much better than area like DongDaeMun (except Doota) and NamDaeMun.Toilets/Washroom commonly located at second floor of cafes, otherwise visit any nearby hotel. Generally it is clean.Cafe recommended would be O'Sulloc, MangoSixShops recommended for guys would be SPAO, BeanPole, TopTen"
overwhelmed with choice!,"Shopping in Seoul is second to none, hundreds of shops and they're all so much cheaper than the UK. Forever 21 is probably my favourite.The downside is most clothes are free size as most Korean women are very slim! The streets can be insanely crowded especially in the winter months so if you're not used to it, it can be quite annoying. Street vendors sell a variety of delicious Korean dishes from spicy dok to dried fish. There are plenty of markets selling jewellery and accessories for cheaper than you would find them in shops.You can't walk down a street in Seould without encountering at least 5 different makeup stores. The makeup shops in most Korean cities are relatively inexpensive but do not cater to those with a non-asian skin tone."
Shopping and Eating,"Shopping for Korean cosmetics is convenient here. All the brands are located within same street, so you dont have to try to find your way while carrying bulk items ( after tens of masks of different types). Street is not as clean. Especially when it rain, please do try to wear covered shoes instead of sandals. Lots of hawkers on the street but I think the stuff is not as cheap. Summer sales is great. Lots of vibrant selling. Young promoters will try to up-sell and cross sell many other things to you. There is also a Osulloc tea house nearby. Especially for those who want a taste of the Korean green tea leaves."
shopping to insane,Awesome. The winding little streets are deceptively massive. Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to shop. Best buy: Korean skincare products
The atmosphere,The prices werent exaclty that great but the atmosphere was something that should be experienced! it was a lot of fun!
Lots to see.,Fun even if you just feel like window shopping. Amazing shoe selection. Great contrast from time spent in nearby Namdamun Market.
Shop till you drop,"If you want to shop like crazy go to Myeongdong! It's an entire area dedicated to shop upon shop. Besides clothing stores like H&M and Zara, this is really the place for you if you like skincare.The Faceshop, Etude House, Missha, Nature Republic, HolikaHolika have several stores right beside each other throughout Myoengdong! N.B. The Forever21 in Myeongdong seem to have closed. I went to the one in Gangnam instead.The area also has the Nanta Theater, loads of restaurants and cafes.However, it's very packed with people 24/7. If you want another less crowded shopping experience go to Gangnam/Garuso-Gil - I really liked that area as well!"
always busy and full of energies,"love to hang out this street, so many things to look around and filled with various ppl!"
Must experience,This is overrun with tourists. But this is a must stop to experience the heart of Seoul. I would recommend going there in the evening. The hustle and bustle is definitely worth experiencing. 
Super fun shopping,"I love Myeoungdong. Some places are pricey, but some are affordable...but that's not the best thing...people watching and the amazing several story cafes are what it's all about. This is such a fun place to go too. They have multiples of certain stores too! Missed skin food on one street? There is bound to be another two streets away! "
Excellent shopping place,"The abundance of skin care products, clothing, accessories and Lotte Department Store at this location is one of the best."
Beauty products everywhere,"Went to Myeongdong last february and again on july, definitely a shopping heaven for beauty products. In just myeongdong itself, there are tonnes of comestic brand. Normally the area of myeongdong would be bustling with people. However during the monsoon season which is late of june to early july, less street vendors around and less people too. But all in all, still a fantastic place to visit as the place is very tourist friendly as foreigner can enjoy numerous discount that is specially meant for foreigners. "
Over-hype Shopping Area,"I find that this place is too 'touristy' and too many repeated cosmetic shops. You can easily find 5 of each well-known brandshop e.g. Aritaum, Faceshop, etc.There are some clothing stores worth a visit but depends on individual taste, you may not buy anything from here. My wife and I did not stay long for shopping. We had our lunch here and honestly left without buying anything."
Retail Therapy,Adrenaline overdrive!! Its a great place to shop and dine! Make sure to check our Myeongdong Gyoza and BBQ Noodle for a great meal! Love how cosmetic shops (except Etude) give freebies just for you to check out their stores!
Nothing special,Just some cosmetics shops here. Nothing special in terms of clothes or accessories shopping. Suggest to go elsewhere e.g. 三清洞 or sinsa.
"Over-Hyped, but a nice stop if you're in the area","I was really looking forward to shopping here - but somehow it was disappointing. I think this was mostly because with the phrase ""Hyper Shopping"" and all the glowing guidebook blurbs I was expecting too much. Once I was there I found myself comparing it to Tokyo shopping districts like Shinjuku or Shibuya and finding it lacking, which isn't really fair of course. If you love cosmetics and want to shop for makeup this would be an awesome place to go - otherwise it seemed to be a lot of western brands, really fake looking knock-offs, and a few department stores. I went in the evening and got to soak up the energy of the crowds, and enjoyed wandering around, people watching and grabbing a little street food. In that sense it wasn't a total loss to spend time here, but in the end I couldn't see Myeongdong as a desired 'destination' but more of a place that would be fun to walk though and browse a little if you were already in the area. In the winter it was beautifully decorated for New Years and lit up, but I sadly left without any awesome fashion finds I went in hoping for. I ended up enjoying smaller shopping areas/department stores around the city more, probably because I didn't have the expectations I had here."
Cosmetics Heaven!,"There are lots of cosmetic shops there, just name it, they have everything (and tonnes of idol standees and banners; TVXQ, PSY, SUJU, SNSD, f(x) etc). Went there for SPAO & Everysing, a must go place if you're K-Pop lover!"
Beauty Stuffs Galore,"If you are a beauty addict, this is your heaven. There are so many beauty shops here - etude, skin food, missha, nature republic, you name it that were selling their facial masks, lotion, bb cream, cc cream, etc in super crazy price. You just need to really know what you want, otherwise you'll end up wanna buy everything because it's just too cute the packaging and too cheap the price and too much options to choose. You can find as well other familiar top brands - H&M, Uniqlo, etc as well as lots of Korean barbeque restaurants worth trying."
My favorite shopping/eating area in Seoul,"Nothing like getting good shopping done in Seoul and MeongDong is the place to do this, its a great visit at night, and lots of choices of foods, bargain areas and beauty products for the wife."
"Shopping, shopping, shopping!","Our guesthouse is located 5 mins walk away from the Myeondong shopping district. This place is for the shopping-lovers! Cosmetics are sold cheap and comes with lots of giveaways. Uniqlo, h&m, etc, its all here. Don't miss the street foods too, cheap and yummy. "
Buzzing!,"It is only the area of a few blocks, criss crossed by alley ways crowded with pedestrians and the occasional crawling car or motocycle, and ringing to the cries of dozens of sales girls enticing you into the numerous cosmetic stores! I would recommend best seeing the area in the evening when crowds are peaking, the sales girls are hoarse, and the restaurants full, to get the full atmosphere of the district. The high class Lotte department store with it's amazing food court are nearby, but there are numerous food options in the district. I highly recommend the Yeongyang Centre (52, Myeongdong 2-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul) for ginseng and crispy roasted chicken in particular. This suburb is not for those afraid of crowds! We found Myeongdong most easily accessed by the 6015 Airport Limousine Bus directly from Incheon Airport, or by the Metro to Euljiro-1-ga station (Line 2) or Myeong-dong (Line 4)."
To the BEAUTIFUL you,"Facial masks and lotions galoreI All the name and unheard brands here. I was here last September and although had not the slightest interest in facial masks, I was pulled in by the offers on the facial masks, facial scrubs and foam - and the brands. Skin Food, Etude, Nature Republic, Missha, Saem, etc. They are like a fourth and more of what you'd pay in my country. Having tried some last year , I returned this week with the intention of buying more. The whole Myeongdong area is filled in the evenings, more so during weekends. Shops and vendors, September seems to be a busier time than June based on my experience on the crowds and offers. Try out the grilled stripped octopus sold by the street vendors. Yummy. Avoid the chewy bigger pieces unless you want to exercise your jaws in the extreme. And if you are one of the k-pop fans, you may get lucky and get to experience the presence of these k-pop stars in Myeondong. Henry of the SJ-M was there for a sign-on event and I was told that Girls Day dropped by - I was wondering then about the few ambulance vans."
Shops shops shops,"Depending on what you like, shops sell all kind of things. From branded goods to some traditional Korean costume and ginseng. There is one shop that sells the ice cream that measures about 1 foot tall in a cone!!!"
shopping?,"It is in my opinion a restautant neighborhood more than a shopping area. Seul is very expensive, in general, and is not a city for shopping"
Great shopping for skin care and cosmetics!,"This are has all the Korean cosmetics and skin care brands. The salesgirls out front entices you into the store with a free gift (usually a box of cotton wool or mask). The stores here usually bundle their products so you usually have to buy a pack of 10 masks or 3 hand lotions. When you do make a purchase, the cashier throws it a whole bunch of samples for you. However, I had bought some masks from the FaceShop counter in Lotte Mart before going to Myeongdong, and found that the price of the face masks I bought there was a little cheaper than at Myeongdong. Do check and make comparisons before making your purchase here. Remember to print out the discount coupons on the visitkorea.com website so you can get a discount at some of the stores here.If you're feeling hungry, this place has restaurants, cafes and street food that can fill your tummy. We had a seafood lunch at one of the alleys which was quite good."
Make-Up shops,"Great shopping in Seoul with a lot of shops special Korean cosmetics, fun to walk around myeongdong in late afternoon to evening. if you are shopper and like everything about Korea, this place must go! :D"
Best place to shop for make-up & skincare,"The best place to shop for make-up & skincare. Most shops are generous with giving out samples. The same popular brands have shops along every street and turn.The major brands all have tax-free shopping. Just ask for tax-return when making payment and they will print out the tax return slip quickly and easily. Most shops will have a chinese-speaking sales staff if you speak only Chinese. There are tourist information volunteers situated at the center of MyeongDong. Some can speak English, Japanese or Chinese. I think they are volunteers there to practise speaking the language. There wear red vests with red hat and are friendly and helpful. They have this MyeongDong map that is very useful. My friends approached them several times asking for information, or where to go for certain food and they would circle out the best place on the map. Beware of cab-drivers out to rip you off. On our first night there, we were trying to catch a cab at around 11pm. We saw a line of cab drivers waiting there and when we approached him, he told us there were midnight surcharges and told us it cost us 40k won to get to our destination (usual was definitely under 10k). In the end we took the subway home)."
Best place for shopping,We visited this place almost every single day during our stay in Korea as our guesthouse was just a 5 min walk from here. And we never get sick of this place! There are just so so many places to shop I don't think we actually covered the entire place even though we went for many days. xD Very tourist friendly as most of the salespersons switched languages the moment they realise we couldn't understand Korean. You can get almost anything from food to clothes to cosmetics to bags here..anything you can name!:D You can probably get a map if you want to navigate around though..many streets were rather similar and there were several times when we walked to the same place over and over again..xD
Great place for shoppers,"It's a happening place in Seoul where you can find the latest fashion trend. Besides fashion, you can get to try the local street food as well. There are lots of beauty and makeup shops and the sales girl will standing in front of the shop giving away free sample. Prices are reasonable. I would prefer this place more than Dongdaemun due to the pricing. Within walking distance, there's a theater to watch Nanta shows, painting show, etc."
So much fun,"We walked through these markets ever day we were in Seoul and I loved it. It's such a great atmosphere and no one attacks you about buying things, Everything is cheap as chips, the street food is great and the Restaurants through out are fantastic also.The Korean people are ABSOLUTELY amazing, super friendly and intrigued by westerners as they wouldn't get many tourists outside of the Japanese. Whenever we looked a bit confused someone who could speak English would always try to help.Overall loved the markets."
Myeongdong Popular Street Snack Beware!,"This is a popular potato street snack in Myeongdong from a street hawker. There are many such stalls along the streets of Myeongdong selling the same snack. Do not buy from this particular one as we saw the handler rummaging in the dustbin beside him, and then immediately went back to frying the food again. Very unhygenic! We were disgusted! This stall uses Psy's photos as advertisement. It's better to be careful with food when you are in a foreign country."
Crazy crazy shopping,"Bought way too many masks with the 10+10 deals. Haha! The place was really huge and crowded most of the time. But hey, that's what a shopping haven is suppose to be!"
Great Night Market,"Impressive market area even for non-shoppers like me. Several blocks of closed streets, good shopping, quality food and street food. Suggest Bulgogi Brothers, good food, great service."
Shopping Heaven,A great place to shop and the place gets busier at night. A wide variety of shops. Modern and trendy place. 
Love this place,"This is my favorite area in Seoul. You can shop and get a tax refund for the items you buy here. there are a lot of shops, restaurants, currency exchange, church, etc. "
Too much fun,"Great place for cosmetics, fake jewellery, trendy shoes. Good food. Try street food. Naemdum market and Lotte store alsoclose by."
good place to shop,"just go here starts at 7pm.. i lovee this shopping district. you can anything.. whether local or international brand.. you name it, H&M, Uniqlo, etc.. don't be afraid if you got hungry, foodstall are everywhere, resto and cafes also."
like Tokyo,"a lot of shops and restaurants.I was trying to find some toy stores, but was not lucky with that.Mostly fashion stores."
nice place to hang out,very crowded but a lot of shopping places.You can find a lot of cosmetics store. Also you can find variety of foods in there
Shop shop shop,"A shopping mecca. For me it is like Time Square in NY at night. Very lively with lighted billboards. There are lots of restaurants, street foods and a place for shopping. Most esp cosmetic shopping. Women will love this place.."
Awesome shopping!,This place can get confusing because the same shop is on every other block. It is a great place to get gifts and ok knock offs. You can find so much to eat here and so much to do. It is very busy at night and filled with stores ready to help you spend your money. 
Shopping + cosmetics,"Myeongdong is highly recommended for those who love cosmetics, as there are plenty shops selling cosmetic products.It is a outdoor shopping, and you may not like it if it is raining.There are plenty of cloth there, price range around 10000won., if u r looking for low price cloth, i would recommend Gangnam express terminal underground shopping mall, as the price range around 5000 won."
Shop till you drop,"You can buy anything, anywhere, from kimchi favoured seaweed to upmarket fashion. Myeongdong dumplings is a must try"
Overwhelming!,I'm not a huge shopper so my review may be a bit biased. There are tons of huge buildings (plural!) that have multiple stalls/shops on each floor. I imagine that to look at each of the stores in the area it would take you about a year. No joke. If you're not a buyer for a store (wholesale buyer) make sure you're walking into a building where they sell to retail buyers otherwise you're wasting your time. There is a sprinkling of food vendors around here but not much to choose from so if you plan on spending a considerable amount of time here bring something to munch on. You'll need it!
The Grove,"If this makes sense at all, Myeongdong reminds me of The Grove in Los Angeles. Outdoor shopping mall with trendy brands. It just feels hip and youthful like that. We even ran into some sort of entertainment TV show being filmed with actress Choi Kang-hee. So although I had never heard of her, that was fun and intriguing to see.Oh and we stumbled upon a tiny currency exchange counter that just happened to have the best rate we saw the entire trip. I wouldn't be able to describe where it is. I probably wouldn't even be able to find it again if I tried myself."
If you want noise and feeling of youth...,"Basically, there are people blaring something over the microphone at every corner of the street, and sea of humans...they say shopping here is good, but I personally prefer Namdaemoon. It is worth a short visit if you want something americanized and want to blend with youth."
A must for shoppers,"If you need somenthing just enter Lotto World and move via bridges from building to building. Huge choice, although a pricey place if looking for brands"
Street Shopping (cosmetic again) heaven!,"This,perhaps, is the coolest street shopping in seoul,close to namdaemun too, with the chic & sophisticated stuffs & peeps to see & be seen, foodies, bargain shops,stylish outlets, it's a cool place to walk & shop around, a must visit!"
"Shop, shop.. shop","Needless for me to say.. here is a shopping paradise for clothings, lots of cosmetic/facial products shops, restaurants and cafes. Since my hotel (Prince Hotel) is near Myeongdong, we came here almost every night. The cosmetic is definitely worth buying because of the lower price and some of the brands which are not available in Singapore. These cosmetic outlets even have staff from China who can communicate in Mandarin."
A shopping and food district heaven!!!,"If you are looking for a trendy hip area that offers not only shopping and gifts for all ages and types, but lots of food - good restaurants, cafes and very local Korean food, Myeong-dong is an area you should not miss!Dongdaemum was good for clothes and fashion, and nearby Myeong-dong - Namdaemun market, excellent if you are looking for gifts, touristy stuff etc. However, Myeong-dong hyper shopping district has a lot more to offer. If you are a 1st timer, be sure not to miss this place, especially those of you looking for beauty products. You will be surprise to find that Faceshop is no longer THE beauty product shop. There are many more that has sprouted out, and that are just as good."
Definitely a must!!!,"This place is a paradise for girls... especially for those who are into cosmeti and facial products!! Upon entering into the shop, they already handing you a free gift, be it.mask or cottons, the price is so much cheaper compare to malaysia and it mostly comes with some discounts and lots of free gifts... :DAs for clothing, there are a lot of shops in myeongdong subway station, which is pretty nice... but dongdaemun definitely provide more options in terms of clothing "
Shopping heaven,"Everyone that has been to Korea said that shopping in Korea was a bit expensive. And I tended to agree with them, especially since I went to Dongdaemun for my first shopping trip in Seoul. I didn't expect much on Myeongdong, but I was wrong. It was a shopping heaven. Everything is only 5000KRW (around 5USD) to 10,000KRW (around 10USD). All were cute. I didn;t spend a lot here, but I got so much stuffs :D"
Vibrant street shopping,"If you are around Myeong Dong don't miss the fun of shopping This area is filled with ladies beauty products in the night it is very coloulrfull and crowded> What ever the climate don't miss the long ice cream cone (32 CM). This area is good for girls and beauty concerned people not for men, unless you are with someone. Forgot to tell this street is filled with food it is really delicious and mouth watering."
So exciting - especially at night,This is a must do if you are in the area. It's really vibrant at night with lots of street and food vendors. You never know what you'll find and it's so much fun to walk around and see what each vendor has. I enjoyed trying all the different street foods. Good stuff
Shoppers Paradise..,There is something for everyone! Nice atmosphere too and lots of different shops pop up here and there. There are some that are tucked away in the corner that offer good buys too..so keep your eyes open!!
Awesomest Place Ever!!!,"Shopper's paradise. From facial products, to food, to phone accessories, clothes, I even had a Korean stamp made from my name in Korean characters from a little shop. Food aplenty, take your pick from the various restaurants here. Fast food, many Starbucks (for the avid tumbler collectors), street food (open faced egg sandwiches, sausages, toasted octopus etc). It's really a haven for shoppers and every nook and cranny has a shop that you must walk into. AWESOME for shopping, spend at least a day here, go during the day and and also at night :)"
The craziest shopping street in the world,"Starting Friday night this place goes into a frenzy. Really busy, great for shopping, so much sound and so much to see and eat it is an attack on all the senses. You have to experience this at least once"
Don't miss!,"This is a place to be! a lot of nice shops and restaurants, Nanta theater. The area is busy 24/7. I love a Lotte department store for the variety of goods and food. "
Exciting Myeongdong,"Shops galore! Everything I like from skin-care, cosmetics, shoes, clothes, accessories to restaurants and street foods. All these can be found from name-brand, mainstream stand-alone and mall stores to interesting street stalls. Vendors start setting up their wares around 4PM. Your visit won't be complete without trying Myeongdong's fascinating street food. Some of the elderly female vendors however mind much when you take pictures of their stall."
Shops and stalls galore,"Very happening place. Lots to browse and buy if you are young and trendy. Lots of shops and stalls selling facial masks. The salesgirls at the doors will entice you with free masks to enter their shop and buy. Was told by a reliable source that the free masks gave pimples on his face after using it. Not sure if it is skin allergy or otherwise. Exercise caution. Free things not cheap, cheap things not free"
everything,"This area has everything, from designer to knock-offs, to korean brand cosmetics, clothing, bags, and shoes. Lots of food, photo booths, cafes, clubs, etc. "
Late night shopping,"In the night, there are street vendors around the area which sell any kind from hair accessories, handphone accessories,bags,socks, etc. Sometimes you can get it cheaper here. If you want to collect free face masks, just allow yourself to be guided by the cosmetic's sales who ask you to enter their shop. Even you don't buy their product, you already get the free mask:).I found the local brand cosmetics are cheaper and even they give free gifts in the Duty Free but you've to pay it in USD or credit card. So for me, myeongdong is just for window shopping :)"
Worth it for the people watching and experience,"When it comes to actual shopping, I think the better experience in Korea is the traditional markets. But Myongdong is worth checking out just to see the throngs of people and the spectacle. I wouldn't travel way out of my way to go there, but if you're in the area for other attractions (multiple palaces and other historical sites are nearby) it's worth taking a look. There are good restaurants in the area too if you want to stop for a bite or a snack."
Let down,It is probably just us - but when we travel going to stores that we have at home in the US is not our idea of a fun day. This is were the NANTA theater is and there are also several good restaurants in the district. If you are looking for something like an extra pair of shoes or a swim suit this is the place to look - otherwise there are better places to explore. 
Spot on,Got a hotel in the area bec. wanted to be central. This place is bustling with shops esp. skincare and clothes. There's plenty of restaurants and coffee shops. Walkable to the stream and other sights.
Shopping so what,Its a nice aggregation of shopping malls and smaller shops. However most brands are available in any big city. What interested me was some of the Korean brands like SPAO. 
Beautiful location,"Myeongdong is very comfortable you for everything. Everything you want you can find it out here such as fashion cloth, cosmetic, restaurant, hair shop etc. Especially this place have a beautiful street great decorated with light or else. It's good for shopping."
nice shopping district,"Convenient,If you visit Myeongdong shopping district, you have seen most trendy Korean fashion Items and street foodquite pricey then other area but this place is the most convenient and has got many flagship store of many brands "
All in one Shopping District,"Myeongdong is simply a one stop shop for shopaholics. I say this because I was there to experience it last April 26, 2013. On one side, it has got the Lotte World which has the Lotte department store, the duty free shop and the Avenuel ( which houses the luxury brands ). On the opposite side, you would find the shopping street which has the different retail shops and boutiques and the mini street market where you find the small stalls. For me, it is a fusion of high end, mid range and low end rolled into one shopping experience."
"Shopping in Seoul, Korea","One shopping area which you should go is th Myeongdong Street - small street shops and stalls especially on cosmetics - a lot of sales girls will give free mask if you visit their shops. Of course they do sell other stuff such as belts, bags, etc - do not really have time to shop around but you must visit this place when in seoul."
Shopping paradise,"You can shop for almost everything here. Most store have staffs who are able to converse in a foreign language e.g. English, Chinese and Japanese."
Scary sales reps at the store front,"They are too pushy and really scary. One of them grabbed my arm and was talking don't know what to me... I assumed she was asking me to take the sample and buy stuff in the store. Some of them were really rude. There was one girl who snatched my cousin's sample as she exited the store because she didn't buy anything from them.Service and friendliness is so different from 2 or 3 years ago. They use to flood us with samples but not anymore. They don't even give us any if we buy below a certain amount. Very disappointed with the cosmetics stores. Clothes and accessories shopping is different. They are not pushy and are nice. Prices are the same as at Dongdaemun, so don't bother going elsewhere to shop for nice and cheap stuff. "
loved it!,shopping haven! discovered so many things to buy here and not expensve too! loved walking in the streets and communicating with local vendors. tourist friendly as well.
Shopping heaven,"If you like to shop, you have to visit Myeongdong while in Seoul! I wouldn't go there for the choice of clothes or underwear, but they certainly have tons of skincare and makeup at affordable prices! "
Great place for shopping,"It is a great place for shopping but for those who prefer souvenir or special traditional Korean item, Insadong is better! TOTALLY DOMINATED BY cosmetic shop!"
a shopper's heaven,"if you happen to be a shopaholic, myeongdong will be like, as they say, your mother ship calling you.looking for some BB cream, CC cream or snail masks? no need to look far, in myeongdong the famous shops are at least 1 shop apart so have your cosmetics fill without breaking any sweat.you can also find apparel shops, restaurants and even food carts. why not sample some twisted potatoes or some creme-filled buns? look out too for those sale that just might earn you your next heels or bag.you know you're in the middle of myeongdong once you see myeongdong theater. i hope to see what's inside next time of this landmark.another landmark you can find in myeongdong is the myeongdong cathedral. english mass is on sundays at 9 AM.in myeongdong, i assure you that your all your senses will be satisfied, not to mention, (most importantly of course) your stomach. so ready those cash and cards and go to myeongdong for your ultimate shopping spree!"
Shoppers' Paradise,"One of the must-go places in Seoul. Shopping heaven indeed! Comes with a variety of brands ranging from their local brands, average international brands and even the few high-end brands. Food stalls available along the way. Lots and lots of cosmetic shops (ie: The Face Shop, Laneige, Skin Food, Nature Republic, etc) Many goodies collected from all these face shops. :D"
Blocks and blocks,"Dominated by cosmetic stores, I think every cosmetic stores are repeated in every block. Be sure to ask for VAT refund if you made a large purchase. For a large person, do not bother to enter clothing or shoes store, as they will not have size available for you even worldwide branded stores, i.e., Nike or Adidas."
Shoppers paradise?,This is Seoul's main shopping drag and one could wander around for days. The whole gamut of shops can be found there ranging from little boutique-like shops to large shopping centres. This is also a neat place for people watching and the younger Koreans are definitely up there with fashion. I did however find some of the shopkeepers unfriendly and they did not seem to like people browsing or asking too many questions. A friend also found that you cannot try things on in some of the shops so buyer beware. Korean free size will fit the smaller Europeans but not the average perosn. Language is not a barrier as long as a calculator is available and ask for a discount - you never know your luck.
Shopping till you drop !,"Busy night and day, the streets are occupied by wheelcarts shops as soon as sunset . Lots of restaurants, cafés, boutiques, the streets of Myeong dông seem to never sleep."
"Was there on Christmas Day, unbelievable","I dont know if it is usually as busy or crazy. We entered from around the Lotte Hotel area, and it got more and more packed with people. There were shops and eateries at all sides.Tables set up selling all kinds of Korean snacks from boiled silkworm pupaes to honey crisp biscuits. There were teams of Korean teenagers with 'free hug' signs, there were people dressed in animal costumes advertising local businesses. We found a great place to eat nearby, my Korean friends picked it, so I dont know that name :-( But we ordered a huge chicken noodle dish that was more than enough to share between 4 people.At the end we attempted to go down into the subway station. Talk about a human mountain, human sea!! It was busy getting down, but it was infinitely worse in the opposite direction!Overall,, too busy to really buy anything, but it was a great thrill to be in the middle of it all on a Christmas day."
Hyper shopping is the way to describe it,"This is the main shopping area as well as having lots of makeup and clothing stores many international restaurants can be found here. Just across the street is Lotte Department store also,Personally I find shopping in Seoul to be more expensive than other cities"
Get all your cosmetic here,"It has all the cosmetics products you need to find from head to toes in this area. Current hottest products make from snail saliva, is a must buy item in your purchase. Nature Republic is the current hot shop in this area."
Heaven for Shopping,"It is shopping heaven. Lady can buy many skin care, make up with a reasonable pricing. You can stay in there more than one day."
Shopping haven,"I would say it's really the best place to hang out. I live nearby, just across the street and I walk by myeongdong almost everyday and I have seen alot of interesting things and products.Cosmetics are a bunch here, 5-6 faceshops in a single street. However the value is a lil steep as compared to the nearby namdaemun or dongdaemun (if you're good at haggling). All in all good place to eat, chill or just a stroll. Maybe window shopping"
Geeat place to shop or just window shopping,"Myeongdong always our favorite place to visit we've been there in Summer, and now we visited in winter. The Seoul's winter is really freezibg, so when you visit Myeongdong, need to wear a real thick clothes. The shops were amazing, many retailers (local or international) are there. From Zara or local made clothes and accesories. You may also find many other international brands. The taste of the area was very Korea, very nice yet warm people. "
Packed,"Had anything u could ever want,, lots of food, snack, souveniors,,nice bargain prices almost like flee market type with vendors set up."
UBER Market on steroids.,"We visited this market multiple times. AWESOME! It was safe, busy, and lots of great bargains! Food stands were plentiful and tasty, as well as very unique. Dont miss it!"
Shop and get free samples,"Korean beauty brands abound in Myeondong. What was exciting was the free samples that they give out. You can also find the Myeondong Theater and the Myeondong Cathedral in this area. There are also food and coffee shops everywhere. For tourists like me, there are tourism information offices located in strategic areas. Myeondong also has several signs to help you with directions. Also, tourism information volunteers go around the area to readily render their help to those who are lost or in need of suggestions.Myeondong is very accessible. Buses ply in this area. You can also take the subway and get off at the Myeondong station or the Eulji-ro 1 (il) ga station."
Shopping paradise!,"This is a central located shopping precinct.Think lots and lots of small shops, plus mid brand range, H&M, Uniloq, Zara and the Koream shops..I found it hard as a large male to fit into Korean shops clothes..the had great fashion and style .. Alas good for my wallet Lol...This place is a shopping paradise for ladies... U name it the have it, cosmetics, shoes, dresses and accessories..Shop ! Sop! Shop! But I found the Gangnam area better! It had great shops, tree lined amongst great cares, coffee n tea shops and restaurants.. Need another day in Seoul !,,"
Shopping haven,"To go to myeongdong is to shop.it is blocks(small ones) and blocks of shops and restaurants all packed together. Cosmetic shops, brand name clothing shops-h&m,unipolar,f21,Lacoste,etc., Korean restaurants,coffee shops(cafe bene,etc).The streets also gets packed with street food carts and carts selling all kinds of stuff-scarves,socks, shirts, bags,pants,etc.-as the day goes on.but, everything is still very organized,safe, and orderly.Their homegrown cosmetic/skin are shops like nature republic, étude,baviphat,etc greets you in almost every block. The promotions in each of these shops differ, one may be slashing their prices on some items ,but, when you reach their other outlets,prices may not be slashed.prices are good and the quality of Korean skincare and haircare products are really good ,too.The various restaurants are also good.it is better to dine in a proper restaurant than fill yourself with street food(where a stick of sausages would set you back by 3000won).you can get a decent restaurant meal starting at 6000won.Would recommend myeongdong for a spot of retail therapy.haggling is not the norm here..if you want to haggle, then, dongdaemon should be your stop."
My Young Gong started ringing with shopping in Myeongdong :),"If you want to stay up late and rather chose to go around elsewhere than bars and party places, you may opt to head here to taste the delectable array of street food and shopping. I pretty much got my fill of Etude House, The Face Shop and the many cosmetic stores they offer. The place offers a shoppers haven with all sorts of budget. Pretty easy to get around and very much safe, I traveled here alone and did not have to worry with a camera around my neck and a huge bag lugged around my shoulder. Great selection of stores :)"
Get your shop on!,"If you're in need of treating yourself, myeongdong is the place to go! The are tons of high end clothing stores and delightful restaurants. As a foreigner living in Seoul, this was a great place to go for a little dose of home. "
"Shopping spree, prepare to spend lots of money if you're a woman/girl","A place where many tourist and South Korean love, especially for girls. Shops after shops that are catered to women, like cosmetic shops and clothing shops. Lots of place to eat and street food vendors are there as well.I bought myself a very nice backpack here, lots of fashion related stuffs being sold here, expensive or cheap you have it. A huge SPAO shop is located there also, if you love KPOP there's a EverySing shop that's right above SPAO. Premium Korean fashion brand Beanpole is right beside SPAO. Great for shopping with friends, but if you're a guy and have girls that are with you then be prepared to accompany her/them for some crazy window shopping. Or just find a place to sit and wait for 3 hours to let them finish up shopping. This place is really a women/girl's heaven for fashion shopping. It's THAT good. Especially when stuffs are quite cheap there. For those in Singapore, Myeongdong is basically a upgrade and a much much bigger version of Bugis Street."
Can get tiring if you are not sure what you want to buy,Endless shops selling similar stuff. Have more stuff for women than men. If you are not someone who likes hanging out while the ladies shop.. dont bother going here as it only tires you.. Some of the so called designer wear looked impressive. However cant claim that things are cheap.
Shopping Paradise in Seoul,"I can say this is the best place for shopping in Seoul.. You can find everything in here.. From food until clothes.. The best part is, CHEAP!! Love being here.. :)"
try long ice cream parfait here and crazy shopping..,"first day in Seoul i already here for lunch with my friend who live in Seoul, she recommended this place and voila i was getting crazy here and visit this shopping area every day before back to hotel at night..its (again) a must place to visit for those who like shopping... i did it and i like it, from famous cosmetic shops like Etude and Nature Republic which were spend more money and they treated us well as they know we are Indonesian *wink* till the local brands i bought shawl, genuine lamb leather boot (cost me only 14,000 Won after discount), beannie hats, souvenirs, passport holders and many more..there are also full of famous brands such as Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Mango and many more and they offer discounts...i had 2 times lunch around here in 2 different restaurants and i love it, as i enjoyed buying souvenirs from local people stalls on the weekend...and one more thing you have to try is ice cream parfait 32cm and i had it for myself even its winter...i will be back herd, for sure... for me, i feel never enough time when i am here..."
Place to be!,"When one visits SEoul, this is really the place to visit and stay. We always stay here because of the convenience of moving around Seoul, the good and variety of food that can be found and of course it is truly a shopping paradise!"
Bring more cash!!,Here is shopping heaven to the gals! You will see the promoters all shouting and ask you to visit their shops. They will also give you free samples in order to attract you to stop and go in :) but it's definitely no regret to step in the shops! So much of choices and CHEAPPP!! 
Fun evening with the family,Nice area to walk through. Lots of lights. Very lively with shopping in the stores as well as on the streets. There were many skin/cosmetic stores. Difficult to buy because I was not familiar with most of the Korean brands and most didn't speak english.
Best Place to Shop & Watch Myungbo Art Hall,"All the good items are here in Myeongdong.Not too pricey, nice cloths & other items that you can choose.After Shoping you may want to see the Myungbo Art Hall, along Myeongdong.A very unique show of art that you'll really enjoy ( at first, i thought it's a waste of time but it's not).We'll surely see this again!"
Best shopping for cosmetic,"Myeongdong shopping can never be bored if you are shopping alone as there are many shops to entertain you, for example if you are looking for cheap cosmetic and certain brands in Myeongdong, you can easily find a shop of what you are looking for in any street that you go, especially for cosmetics!There are also staffs in the cosmetic shops that can speak English, Chinese and Japanese too! Just keep a look out of badges on their shirt to see which languages can they speak, if not you may want to approach them and ask directly in your preferred language.Also, if you prepared a list of cosmetic to purchase, show it to the staff and they will help you to find the products for purchase!"
Everything is here!,"You can find everything here. Who needs to shop elsewhere. Heaps of fashion, beauty, and food. Make sure you have cash in order to get discounts ( stores will not give discounts for card because they lose 10% to the card company. But if you pay cash, they will give you the 10% off, and maybe a little bit more depending on how good you are at bargaining).I find the sales people at clothing stores to be extremely pushy which I don't like. But there is so much fashionable stuff here that you can put up with some attitude."
Shopping heaven of Korea is like this...,"Every city in the world has an area where it is all happening with shopping and dining. Myeongdong fits the bill as the most hip place for everyone, local and tourist all love this place, also regardless of age too. This place starts to come alive around 11am and lasts up to pass 11pm, the only place that can rival it is Dongdeamun, but that's another story. Come here to see the newest trends, see all the fashion shops and cosmetic houses, numerous famous restaurants, souvenir stores...etc. It is a great place to do all the shopping in an hour or two, or more if you are really strong.For a bit of natural relief, one could get to the Namsan N tower, which isn't far away, or see the famous Myeongdong church. This place really is the top choice for seeing the new faces of Korea."
Nice shopping / eating / drinking zone,"Fun shopping experience day or night (we stayed for both) and we found plenty to look at from high fashion to cheap stuff. It winds around and around, so try to keep your bearings. The 4 metro station drops you right in the heart of it, or you can come at it from Seoul station and walk. Lots in the area if you're looking to wander as well. "
Skin care & cosmetic product,"We were intend to take subway at Myeongdong station after coming down from N Seoul Tower.We walked from Namsan cable station about 10min then we arrived at Myeongdong shopping district. The most famous attraction regarding Myeongdong is the skin care & cosmetic product.There are so many brands of skin care product.Got a lot of sales girls standing outside the shop to attract the customers.Their service is very good.The very long street most of it selling skin care product. We came evening time that is the peak hour,so there were so crowding along the street.I bought hand creams here,the price is reasonable,with a lot of samples,FOC....The currency exchange rate here is better than any other place,the owner of our hostel told us so.After we came here and doing some research,we found its true."
Myeongdong - where to shop for Korean Skin care and cosmetics,"just got back from Myeongdong - took subway Line 4 from Sinnohyeon. I went there to buy Tony Moly skin care (BB cream, CC cream and Hydro gel mask), I also got samples along the way. There are very good street food (cupcake with egg, scalloped french fries, grilled octopus), It is a fun place to shop for Korean skin care, eat street food and experience the atmosphere.you should try it"
Asian fashion but low quality,"There are lot's of things to see (and buy) here, especially for those who are into asian fashion-think japan pop. Size are limited so travellers from europe or america might have problem fitting into the selections.Price wise it's not expensive say compare to China (not knock offs) but the quality is not very good. Buttons fell off after awhile. Shop wisely.."
After a few blocks it all looks the same... because it is.,"Myeongdong is crowded day and night. Lots of shopping, but many of the same stores block after block. There are like 4 Etude makeup stores in the neighborhood. Mostly stores for teens and 20-somethings. Don't eat in this neighborhood, most of the restaurants are not good. We stayed in the area and ate around here 4 times and were disappointed with all but one, a Korean chicken soup and dumpling restaurant that seemed very popular and was recommended by our hotel. Highly recommend Hara Donuts though!"
If shopping is your thing..,"Myeongdong is really a shopper's haven. A lot of shops to choose from and you can get items at a discounted price. Shops like forever 21, rabeanco, uniqlo, and most Korean cosmetic brands can be found here. There's not much to see here. But this shopping district is really exciting and full of action at night with all the light and people. Another place you can enjoy if you like people watching and shopping. "
Happy shopping,Everything cheap and pretty.My mum bought so many things.The people are beautiful and the shop ladies and boys are friendly.Nothing to lose shopping here
paradise for shopper,the street are full with shop houses whether its branded or local things from skin care products to clothing...there are also food/snacks stall and restaurants. don't forget to bargain when you want to buy something. ^^
Amazing!,going to this area is a must if you go to Seoul! Shopper's paradise is all i can say. There are lots of shop here. you can find what you need here.And will be more crowded at night. there are lots of food stall too!
Why go to Myeong-dong again?,"Well, there are many good korean food to try out! You should the korean Hot Dog's or visit the great korean restaurant ( We went there twice, because the it was so yummy). In addition are there many cute shops. You can buy nearly every thing, from tea, to 'Gangnam Style' socks. It is near gyeongbokgung so you can combine both very well."
Great safe place to shop,"Every night we went browsing in this bustling market place, the locals are very polite and happy. Very clean and colourful market. But the stalls sell food that an English/Australian stomach may not suit,...very spicy. Right at the end of the street is a big shop that has a karaoke competion where anyone from the street can step up. The teenagers Girls and Boys made fun of themselves and everyone loved it. They didnt take themselves too serious. "
High class shopping center,"if you want to buy a branded items in Seoul, then Myeongdong its the right place, there was Grand Korea 2013 sale in winter time, don't miss it, you will get your favorit items in great discount"
Good place to experience what's hot in the market,"Very easy to find location - next to the exit of MTR. Almost every hot brands in Seoul got a branch here. This is a good place to know what's popular in the Seoul market. However, it only refers to those big brands. If you stay longer, you would find two or more branches of same brands there. Too commercial."
Shopping on overdrive,"This echoes what many of the other Reviewers have said: the Myeong-dong shopping district is bright, busy, colorful, crowded and completely insane. I was in Seoul in January/early February but even in the middle of Winter, the streets were packed with shoppers -- locals and tourists alike -- in bulky coats, most carrying heavy shopping bags in both hands. If you like cosmetics and skin care products, Myeong-dong will have your adrenalin running on overdrive. Every Korean cosmetic brand has not one, but several shops within a few meters of each other. Business is brisk but highly competitive. Each cosmetic store posts one or two sales ladies at the front, who offer free product samples to entice passers-by to enter the store. Aside from skincare shops, mid-range clothing brands are also represented with flagship store-sized branches of Uniqlo, Zara, Mango, H&M, and Forever 21 planted in between the cosmetic shops, hotels and restaurants. When the sun sets, it gets even more frenetic. Food carts selling all kinds of snacks (Korean mandoo dumplings, grilled squid, chicken skewers) cooked on-the-spot, in many cases, appear at every block. I'd say some of the better meals I've had, have been from the food carts at Myeong-dong. There are numerous proper restaurant options in the area, including the famous porridge shop called Migabon. What I really liked about this area is that there were Seoul Tourism volunteers posted at key intersections to provide information and help out tourists with directions. Just look for the folks wearing bright red coats and an ""i"" (for information) patch."
It would be better to shop if the mall is not so crowded with human traffic ,Nice to shop especially when you're so into cosmetics and beauty products and skin care.only thing is that the mall is too crowded which causes inconvenience to shop. Prices are quite reasonable when there are sales 
Why go to Myeong-dong again?,"Myeong dong use to be a shopping and entertainment district, lots of youngsters hangout there.It's now seems to be a faded glory.i recommend to go to Hongda instead. It's an university district,Full of restaurants, bar, cafe, shoes boutique, clothing shops, mobile shops, many youngsters like to go there, grab a coffee in one of the funky cafe joint, you can easily spend one nice evening in Hongda."
Vibrant and happening area,So much going on this area. However there is no toy store in this area. All Cosmetics or Fashion. If you look closely some store give quite a good discount or do a surprise discount.. so watch out !! 
Endless shopping!,"Myeondong consists of street after street of shops, mainly catering to fashion. There are also many restaurants there. During our recent visit we were told by our guide that shops at Myeongdong would be closed due to the Lunar Holiday but we still tried our luck and boy, he was so wrong. Almost all the shops there, including the street market were open and we had a jolly time shopping till late at night!"
Retail and Other Drugs,"The other reviews have adequately described the feel of this place, and listed the global brands found here. This is more about those little bits that stressed me out while shopping.I am bored by H&M, and go to Uniqlo for utility wear, so I was in the market for something different. 1. I didn't think my inability to speak Korean was a handicap until I went here. I wanted to buy clothes and make-up, and just found it awkward explaining what I wanted, maybe because I'm not the type who's 100% sure of what I want. I need a little bit of sales talk, but hard sell is intimidating.You have to be assertive to get the shop ladies to tell you if they have your size, or even just to interrupt them while they are gossiping so you can buy that dress. I swear, to this day I regret not buying a dress at Migliore because I wasn't sure I could cut in on two ahjummas in discussion.The make-up shopping experience is another thing. I don't use make-up, but wanted to buy some products for my secretary and a friend's teenager. Almost every corner has the same make-up stores, so it can make you gag after a while. Oh, the salesgirls are really pushy -- they will call your attention while you're walking and try to get you to buy. But when I actually did follow a salesgirl into a store, and the time came for me to explain what I wanted, the salesgirls kind of clammed up. I guess it's hard to give the usual sales talk if you can't talk to the buyer. I did manage to buy some products, plus get loads of freebies, but I wouldn't be able to explain what the benefits of each item that I bought. It could really have been snake oil, but I paid for it.2. For some reason, the bar code sticker on an item that I paid for in one store triggered the door alarm as I was about to leave a completely different store. Thief! Fearful of being tackled to the ground, I went back in to look for a manager to look through my bags and establish that I didn't take anything without paying. That was a bit hard to explain to the salesclerk that I approached; stranger still was that no one actually approached me to do the check on my stuff. Eventually a manager was found; each item was scanned until the culprit was identified and disarmed. I am so glad it was an item that couldn't be found in that store. Otherwise, yikes. This experience has left me wary of those door alarm things. I now have an annoying habit of walking slowly past those things just in case the alarm goes off, if only to establish that I am not shoplifting. Groan.3. As for eating, Myeongdong is famous for kalguksu, but I Googled that and found out that I was allergic to some seafood in the broth. Research on where to eat. There are plenty of food places, but I ended up at McDonald's. I will come back -- maybe it's better experienced when shopping with friends instead of alone. I make it a point to live near Myeongdong because it's still a great place, notwithstanding the stuff I just said above. I can't imagine living anywhere else while on holiday."
So many shops that sell from head to toe.,This area is likely to sell almost branded and expensive products. Not so many things you can bargain to buy it since almost all products are sell in the concrete building.What I can see are some stalls selling foods in the middle of walking street.
Best shopping!,Lots of stuff are available within the 1 place. CDs are cheap. Full of street snacks which offers a wide varieties of typical korean snacks.
Lots of shops and tourists,"this is definitely a tourist friendly location. Most the shops (cloth, accessories, cosmetics) people can speak multiple languages. They start in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. This is to cater all the popular tourists destination. Also the fun fact is that cosmetics shops give up free samples at the door to lure people to step in to see their products. overall, you can spend a day here."
Shoppers heaven,"You can literally buy anything here. The area is huge that the first stop is the accessories and the next is the fashion area. If you like to shop, then this is the place for you. Souvenir items, k-pop, k-drama or hallyu souvenirs are all in these areas. Bring extra luggage coz you'll need it :)"
fantastic shopping area,"The place to go for almost everything from cosmetic, duty free (which is just a short distance walk to Lotte Duty Free), street snacks and cds...."
Shop till you drop,"A good place to find everything proudly made in korea such as in house cosmetics, clothes and shoes. Branded retail is also found here like flagship stores of Zara, mango, uniqlo, H&M. You may get lost but it's easy to ask around or you will find a couple of tourist assist staff that are more than welcome to address your questions"

This place is cray cray!,Do you want to shop til you drop?...down dead on the ground only to get trappled? Well then this is the place for you! Just kidding. But this seriously is the place to find every and anything you are looking for! They even have 2 H&M's store within in walking distance of each other. There is also a famous noodle shop by one of the H&Ms if you excite from the mens department...I forget the name though :(There is so much to do here and so many restaurants and coffee shops to explore. You really need and entire day if you are a tourist. And this is a sweet spot for all the expats living in Korea!
Favorite Place to Shop,"This is where I always go to shop in Seoul. Most of it is outside and it's great to stroll along the streets and look in the shop windows, however there might be more interesting things to look at on the streets themselves. There are loads of tourists here, especially Japanese, and you can hear the Korean vendors yelling at them in Japanese. This is a haven for the hip and trendy and some of the outfits that the ladies wear are incredible to behold. You can find international shops here, like Aldo, Uniqlo, Forever 21, H&M, and Puma. You can also find Korean stores here to such as T-Hous and A-land and various other boutiques. Its easy to find larger sizes in the international stores, but they are still very limited in sizes in the Korean boutique stores. If you go on the weekends, expect massive crowds of people pushing and shoving their ways to shops. If you don't like getting your elbows out to defend yourself, you'd be better off visiting during a weekday or going to the top floor of the Krispy Kreme and watching the madness from above. There is a lot more happening on the weekend though and there are loads of street vendors selling everything from fake Louis Vuitton bags to sunglasses to food. But don't expect the roads to be closed to cars!"
Entire day of shopping and eating,"This place is huge and crowded, even during the winter. There is tons of shopping, entertainment, and food. It's fun to walk around to all of the food vendors and try everything out, especially if you are a foreigner. It will take you most of a day to navigate around this area because there is so much to do and see. I think it's a must for anyone vacationing in Seoul."
Enjoyed my time there.,Lots of people at night and if you go during day time I think most street stalls are not open yet. However I think you should go to Insadong as well!
Remember to shop underground also,"Keep your won close to you. Myeongdong has retail (upstairs) and discount (underground) so take your time shopping. Some of the underground vendors do not have prices, so (to me) this means negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. Lots of great bargains and places to people watch. Do it!"
Definitely a shopping district!,"A must visit shopping district. If you've read blogs about trips to Korea this is definitely one of the highlights. And they are definitely RIGHT.I enjoyed roaming the streets of Myeongdong on our last day in Seoul and definitely got good stuff there. But not really when it's winter..haha Therefore, I'm definitely going back there for a summer season trip.."
Shopping & Eating Paradise at Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is a convenient place for shopping, eating, and living place for tourists. My family spent a few days in Sejong Hotel, which was just renovated last year and a very convenient and nice hotel. We were walking around the streets in Myeongdong area, shopping and eating there. There are a great variety of shops for young guys and family, including casual wear, formal suits, jackets, and beauty goods for family, and also coffee shops and Korean food."
Shopping mecca!,"I love Myeongdong for all the fashion and beauty shops! Everywhere you turn, you can find the trusty Korean beauty shops like Etude House, Skin Food, Missha and The Face Shop. Fashion biggies like H&M and Forever 21 are also found here. Try to sample one of the many Korean BBQ restaurants in the area."
Buzzing atmosphere,"The atmosphere of this place is buzzing and there are so many things to see or buy amongst the huge crowd of mostly young people. There are a lot of places to shop at or explore and the prices are reasonable. Food stalls line the middle of the street selling cheap stuff like chicken, fried potato, squid, etc and other stalls selling reasonably priced clothes. Pictures of Korean celebrities are posted almost everywhere from the billboards overhead to the shopfront of the many Misha, Tony Moly, Nature Republic cosmetic stores. While you're there, look for a place selling frozen yoghurt and for around 3000 won you get a huge serving on a cone."
Great Shopping Place,This was beside our hotel... It was an awesome shopping place. I was able to find winter clothes we badly needed last month. I didn't realize it was that cold in the city. The price was surprisingly affordable too... :-)
A mixture of store and items,"Able to find good deal inside the shopping mall. If you are bored of the shopping mall, around the corner there are a few shopping mall for you to explore."
Must do even if you dont shop!,"We didn't buy a thing while here but enjoyed looking at the huge crowds, display windows of the fancy and typical stores, interesting street vendors.There was even a CAT CAFE!!!VERY busy!Also very photogenic!"
"Good energy, lots of restaurants, but all very similar","Had some good deals on clothes needed last minute due to luggage issues at the airport. Streets were packed, but relatively short walk from the hotel."
awesome...fashionable street,"endless shops selling all sorts of stuff mostly fashion items like clothes, shoes, accesories, bags and etclove love love themthere restaurants too where we had our dinneri am strolling at this street every night before going back to my hotel if youre lucky..you can watch the performance on a stage at the entrance of this street...a very k-pop performance..its a must visit place in seoul"
Awesome place to shop,This place has great shopping that stays open all night long. Shops actually have weird store hours on Mondays. I think they are closed until 6pm and open all night.
Similar to all shopping centers,"Good for ppl who want to do shopping for everything at one place, especially cosmetics, they have The Face Shop, Nature Republics, It's Skin, etcs. are all there, and you could even find the same brand has more than 3 shops on the same road, and also some other Japanese shops(full of Japanese customers...). Honestly i think it's quite similar to Busan shopping street, and all shopping centers in the world, shops are on 2 sides of road next to each other, the path is narrow, coffee shops and Lotteria fast food rest. could be found there also. people are everywhere by weekends. apart from cosmetics,they also sell little stuff, gifts, clothes, bags, etc.,but more than half are imported goods. we only walked for 20min then spent another 2hours in coffee shops. if for shopping, at least 2hours.Myeongdong is also renowned for restaurants but we didnt go to any. street food looks tasty. if you are interested in cosmetics shopping or want to experience business shopping street then try myeongdong, for other purposes, there are many better places in Seoul to visit. :-)"
Give me a Break!,15 million hyper juvenile female Korean shoppers grooving to the ultra low prices for junk. What a rush for men!
Best Deals for Cosmetics,"You'll get great deals with cosmetics (Face Shop, Etude, Missha etc) All stores are always on sale. I always didn't notice that I've been shopping from morning till 11:00am... Lotte Department store is expensive though than their Duty Free Shops and other stores in Myeondong."
Shopping,"Too much shopping to do, could spend the whole day here if the wallet permits. Only drawback is that most of the shops are selling the same items. During winter, you see most shops selling winter apparels. "
Very happening during the night,Shops started to opened from 10am onwards. Lots of eateries and shops .... Much more happening during night time when the night market starts ... 
Shopping!!!!,Busy area but most shops seems to sell similar things. 20% of the shops sell cosmetic. Many food choices at great price too.
cosmetics and other shopping activities,here you'll can see the sale persons compete to each other to attract customer get in to their shops. pleasantly get the free gift and have a look on korean cosmetic brand. 
Another shopping street.,Nothing much to see plus was too crowded. Definitely not the place to go during winter. We were too busy trying to hide in shops and cafes due to the cold. You can find most of the big name shops in any other cities as well.
"Shopping, dining and entertainment, fun and exciting","This is a fun and exciting area to stroll around. Whether you are shopping or dining or just walking around, it is a comfortable and relaxing experience. But be warned it can be very busy at times, with many locals shopping and eating out especially after work, but still I love this area and always love walking around and finding different places to eat. The beautiful Myeongdong Theatre is located here as well as the Nantra Cooking Show, which is not at the Myeongdong Theatre but in the UNESCO building. Easiest directions for reaching the Myeongdong Shopping area is if you are standing in front of the Lotte Department Store, look to your right and across the street and you will see the Archway entrance. You must go down under the street to reach it. This is also a huge underground shopping area, but once upstairs, you will be at the entrance. There is every conceivable store for shopping and every possible ethnicity of restaurants. From expensive to cheap.. If the weather is warm, expect to see many outside shops and stalls serving all kinds of foods, drinks, ice cream and snacks. If at night, you will be amazed at the different colors of bright lights advertising stores and restaurants."
Crazy Shopping!,And great street food! Fantastic place for shopaholics! The streets are filled with cosmetic shops and clothes and street food stalls. Probably the best place to shop in Seoul. 
Shopperholic paradise,"Anything you want from branded stuff to round of the mill stuff is here. The prices are reasonable too...I was told the prices of the branded stuff (Channel/Gucci etc) were comparable to Paris.. Surprise surprise....The street food sold here are a MUST try for visitors.....It all differs from being pungent, salty, sweet, spicy, sea-weedy, stinky (to some people). Whereever you come from, it will be a great palate experience.... "
Crazy,"Think cattle farm. Massive amounts of people all rushing around. Pretty neat, but certainly wouldn't want to head into area again. Way to many people for my liking."
Non stop shopping and eating!,Love the shopping and the street food! But do expect huge crowd at some places or even on the streets! It's easy to navigate around the area too!
Crispy Cream,"Yummy. And Pizza Hut but not pizza like we are used to in the States. Lots of vendors set up w jewelry and hats, gloves, etc. "
A place for every shopper!,"I've been living in Seoul for four months and I go to Myeongdong three times a week. I lived on campus (Dongguk) and it is a 15-20 minutes walk from here to Myeongdong, so if I wan to eat something I'll go there. I recommend ""Rimini"" to have lunch or dinner in Myeongdong! It's an Italian restaurant, but one of the best where you have good food for reasonable prices. Since I'm a girl I love shopping! During the weekends it's very crowded in the streets, but also at nights when the street stalls come out and settle down in the street, so that means that the street will become narrower. Anyways there are lots of Korean local clothing shops, but also brands as Forever21, Zara, Mango, H&M, etc. If you are Asian and you have size S Korean shops are a must for you! Though this is ""Asian S"". It's kind of different. Koreans are slim and not that tall comparing with Europeans or Americans... But you still can enjoy other shops. Oh yeah, there are lots of women screaming and waving with their samples in front of their stores. Hehe, very annoying, just ignore the lady. :-)"
Shopping madness,"This must-visit shopping district is littered with standalone shops and multi-storey malls. You will find a lot of tourists and many good looking/fashionable people here. Cafes are abundant too. In short, the atmosphere is great. I love the stuff on heavy discounts at H&M. My only grouse is that there are too many duplicate shops selling the same cosmetics. Every corner you turn, you will bound to see either Faceshop, Skinfood, Etude.... etc. It's like they own this town. I wonder whether they are related....."
Shoppers paradise,This is an area to get good retail therapy. It is encompasses many bustling side streets plus very large departmental stores with up to twelve floors and a range of quality merchandise that is amazing. The food courts in the large stores are really superb.
Very good shopping area,"Lots of big department stores, shops and foodstalls. Very busy traffic around this area, lots of people around. easy to find money exchange shops, banks. "
Insane!,"This place is crazy! I've never seen a shopping area so full, then again, I did go right before Christmas, but based on the other reviews it seems like it's always like that.The only place in Korea you will find Forever 21 and, as far as I know, Red Mango!"
Shopper's Heaven,I love it here...the shopping possibilities are endless...and the street food is cheap and delicious!
shopping,"We've been going to this shopping area for the past two years since we've gotten to Korea. It's a very big area and there's outdoor walking and going in and out of stores as well as indoor department store shopping. It's usually very busy and filled with a lot of people, but the business doesn't take away from the fun and feeling of the area. There's also a lot of different types of food to eat around the area"
Winter shopping till the end of days...,"Rumor has it that end of days is on 21 December...here we are in myeongdong shopping after our 2days ski trip in Alpensia. We are from Singapore, the hot tropic, so the winter shopping is not very exciting for us. Every boutiques here are selling winter clothing (even the shoes are not those which will suit the hot weather back home). But I must say I am very pleased with my choice hotel Ibis Ambassador which is right next to Myeongdong shopping district. There are so many Korean cosmetics stores & local fashion brands all located in this district. We are so very pleased to be greeted by snow while we are shopping ( we did not get to experience snow falling from the sky even when we are in Alpensia, snow is already 2 feet deep when we get there...no idea how the snow get there too). Anyway, I still get to buy bags of Laneige & Faceshop products enough to last me a few months, so shopping is still goooodd!!!"
Souvenirs and face mask central,"If you are in Seoul, and love beauty products - you MUST visit Myeongdong. The number of shops selling beauty products (especially masks!) is just astounding! You'll find the same company in more than one shop in this area.. one at the start of a street, and one at another. Buy face masks here - a reasonably good brand like Nature Republic, Faceshop etc - will have face masks selling at about USD 0.70 each (in packs of ten) - which is 20% of the price it's sold in their shops Malaysia! Excellent as souvenirs. There are so many beauty product shops - competition is stiff - and consumers benefit - because shops will give out samples, and you can use the tester products. Don't be shy to ask for more samples when you purchase products (especially if you buy a lot), most shops will oblige.Souvenirs sold at Myeongdong are also cheaper than those sold at Insadong. I would recommend buying socks! if you are a fan of the Korean instant noodles, Shin Ramun - you can get Shin Ramun socks here.There's also street food, stalls selling bags, clothes at very reasonable prices."
Always there!!,"It's nice to snack and shop in this area. From your Kpop stuff (not authentic of course!) to winter hats, scarves to doebuki and grilled cuttlefish, this is the place to be till late at night. Beware tho! Do not buy the DVDs. No guarantee of English subtitles regardless of what they convince you!"
Shop til you drop,"I enjoyed shopping here. Lots of discounts and freebies in almost every store. It's a must for shoppers! Some of the stores here are Uniqlo, Zara, Forever21, Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Pancoat (i love Pancoat!), make up shops and more. There are also good korean and western restaurants in every corner. Also, don't miss the Myeongdong Cathedral, the structure is pretty awesome. =) If you don't like shopping in very crowded places or hate to be dragged by your girl in every store, this is not for you. Girls will definitely go crazy here, entering store ever store hahah! My brother regretted coming with me and our lady friend. =P"
Shopping,"Things aren't all that cheap over here, but it's great for cosmetics and facial products. There's perpetually a crowd all times of the day!"
Noisy crowded !,"Myeongdong is THE PLACE where to have a walk for shopping in Seoul ! During the day, there is nothing special but a lot of shops, but from about 6.00 PM : the place really starts to be crowded !It has to be seen !!"
Great for cafés! ,"I'm not that fussed about shopping to be honest so at first my husband and I were walking around and just seeing the same things - cosmetics and the like. However, we then saw a sign for a cat cafe and my husband didn't believe me that they had cats inside. They did and it was amazing! You can play and feed the cats and watch them play with each other, it's awesome. We went back later in the week and went to a dog cafe which was insane. The dogs were really fun and if you sit on the floor they love to curl up in your lap. We went to a different cat cafe after which was different to the first but just as good. Highly recommend Myeongdong if you are into animals. "
Good place to visit,"Very interesting place to visit. Be sure to go back at night. Lots of cosmetic and clothing stores, but very high pressure sales by the salespersons in front of the store."
Shopping Extravaganza,"It's ALWAYS packed with people, but there's a reason for this: this area is like a shopping district for the all those shopaholics in the world: there's everything you can wish for and more, but all of it in a neighborhood setting, complete with cute themed coffee shops (i.e. cat coffee shops, doggy coffee shops: where it's filled with actual dogs and cats running wild!) and restos and SO much more! Must go experience it to believe it!"
Heaven for shopaholic!!,"We enjoyed shopping here and especially when you like skin care and cosmetic products because every where you look there will always a boutique for skin care and cosmetics,I was impress with the Korean ladies skin they are flawless. A lot of shops from clothes to super market, everything you need is here and the best part was the price was very cheap compare to my country.one day is not enough to walk all around the shops, I'm so in heaven. Theres a lot of restaurants and fast food too, the food is spicy but delicious and it's a reasonable price, especially Korean BBQ!!! If I have a chance to go back to Korea I will definitely go back here!"
Amazing Shopping Paradise,"One of the best places to shop anywhere in Asia/Globe..so much of variety of almost everything esp. Cosmetics/clothes/shoes etc. Lovely walking streets..cafes..street food is amazing..missing the place so much..S.Korea is a must visit and love the people – so helpful,polite,well spoken, cultured…hope to visit soon again in summers..Myeongdong sure would make all girls go crazy."
Shop Shop and Shop!,"All the skincare and cosmetic products you want to buy is here! And there are so many shops. Each time you buy, they will give you some product samples, most of the time, even before you went into the shop! There is also a lot of street stores and food carts and cafes and restaurants. There are several money changer here, and as far as SGD goes, the rates are pretty good. Very near 2 subways, its quite accessible. Nanta theater is also here. So you can probably watch the cheaper 11am show, then proceed with your shopping!"
In Love with Seoul,"Myeongdong is a lot of fun...there's something for everyone here! Branded clothing, sportswear, locally made ""fob"" clothing, and of course tons & tons of cosmetics and accessories for the girls! Lots of affordable food, albeit mostly Asian/Korean, and cafes including cat & dog cafes! Just note that stores do not open until about 11am and it does not get too busy until late afternoon. Make sure to check out the area after dark as that's when all the stalls are set up and you get to try the awesome street food and haggle some nice bargains with the vendors! Gotta love Asia!"
Great Shopping Place for the Ladies,"The place is home to mid-priced local and international brands but one of the highlights would be shopping for cosmetics and skincare products in Etude House, Face Shop, Tony Moly, Holika Holika, Nature Republic, Skin Food, etc. There is a cosmetic store every few steps. Store personnel often hand out free samples to entice customers."
Heart of Seoul's shopping,Mega shopping area in Seoul...seemingly endless streets and side streets of shopping that you can't get enough of. Push carts line up in the middle of the street to provide more variety that you can't get enough of 
Latest Fashion Mode and Crowd People,Good for shopaholic. You can find all the branded fashion in the world on the jungle oh high building.
Shopping paradise and cosmetic heaven!!,We were there 3 times during our short 8 days trip to Koera. it was very cold at night but business as usual for the shops. You can practically buy anything from branded to local stuffs. It's a cosmetic heaven as there are so many brands available (many store have many outlets there).
"Good range of buys, but a little crowded","We went there after a Church Service on a Sunday morning and it started out quite ok, with loads of shopping places to visit, and street food... but after lunch, the place got more crowded and within a few hours we didn't feel like shopping so much..."
pulsating with life,"The area is alive from early morning to late evening. If you don't want to shop, you can just walk around and people watch!"
Variety Shopping,I loved shopping the streets at Myeongdong for its variety. The shopping malls were also great in its selections!
Its all about shopping,"With large selection of discount outlets selling products at low prices especially cosmetics, accessories & clothing."
shopping area. skincare paradise,"this is a place for shoppers and woman.you can buy a lot of skin care products. if you are faceshop, skin77, skinfood and etude house lovers, you can shop a lot of products here but those products can be buy at others places too.the prices for all cosmetic products are standard. the only benefits here is you can get almost all general cosmetic products without needed to search anywhere."
Shopping haven,"A must to go place for shopaholic though it gets very crowded on weekends.Good bargains on home grown beauty products like Face Shop, Etude House, Nature Republic etc"
"skincare paradise, but that's about it","It seems like each Korean skincare brand has at least 20 outlets in the area. It just gets too repetitive in terms of tenant mix. There are a few interesting shops, but you really have to screen through all the repetitive skincare shops and tourist traps very patiently to find them. Good luck."
Cosmetic lover's place,"If you're a cosmetic lovers ,no need to go another place because all are here! Just a short walk to the Seoul Tower from here."
Great shopping and restaurants,"It's a place you should not miss if you are visiting Seoul. Streets are full of shops, street vendors and amazing restaurants. Street vendors starts to appear around 5pm. Great place to try some of the Korean cuisine such as Samgyetang (chicken soup), Seafood hot pot, dumplings, and noodles. When you get tired of walking, it's time to get massage (it's cheap!). If you are looking for a splurge, Lotte Department is around the corner! "
amazing area,"lot of animation, great store all different from each other, and above all, very good view of the Korean fashion style !!!!!!"
Awesome street food!,"Myeongdong comes alive at night with all the street food vendors lined up in the middle of the streets. Be sure to check them out! Cheap and delicious food. It's a cosmetic and skincare haven. You can find many Korean skincare brands and there is bound to be one at every alley. Other than the bigger main streets for more well-known international brands, go to the small alleys for some fashion by the Koreans! I didn't get to walk through the whole of Myeongdong, it's huge! Allocate more time for it when you're in Seoul!"
Let's go shopping !,"A great place if you want to go shopping : there are clothes shops, beauty shops, CD shops, etc... However it is not the best place if you're looking for cheap items !"
korean fashion crazy,"This is the place to be for korean shopping!!! local brands with very affordable price and high quality goods. forget about the bargains in south gate and dongdaemun this is the hippest place! My advise book a hotel in savoy, skyparkhotel 1 make sure its near spao store or Ibis hotel you are right smack in myeongong area!!!"
Comestics Heaven,"This shopping district is filled with life!Music, voices and smell of food is every where!Best time to visit around evening when road side stalls open!Comestics all going cheaper than those selling in Singapore.Beautiful bags, shoes going at 10,000wonShoes sizes are kinda small, the biggest size for female is 250mm, about uk5.5Not much sale of clothes here though.And if you are there and a cats' lover, please please visit their Cat's cafe!!And if you are a dogs' lover, visit their Dog's cafe too :)"
Good if you're a woman.,"Myeongdong was ok. A lively and bustling area especially at night (good place to try street food, too), but if you're looking to shop for clothes and cosmetics, check out the area at Ewha Women's University first (subway stop: Edae/Ewha Women's University on the green line) before going to Myeongdong. Everything's cheaper there as it's all student-friendly prices! That's what I did, and when I got to Myeongdong, I didn't feel like buying anything anymore."
Shop til you drop!,"my friends and I loved Myeongdong! We visited the place everyday during our 12 day trip since it was just 5 mins away from our hotel. Even though it was sooo crowded and hectic, if you need to do cosmetic or accessories shopping, this is the place to be! There are also guides in red vests that help you if you have any questions as to where everything is or if you simply need to get a map from them. Myeongdong is HUGE, so it can get tiring, so multiple trips is a must if you need to complete your shopping. They also have tons of restaurants and coffee shops if you get hungry while shopping. So, if you're a shopaholic, this place is definitely for you...if you're not, it's still worth a visit during your trip!"
Drp by or drop in,"I dropped by in September, curiosity didn't kill me. I got free samples of masks including the one that has the snail's slime! Has yet to try it. And ended up buying some items here and there, then realized that they were so much cheaper than the same ones back home. Even if you're not into beauty products, which I wasn't, it's a good experience to see the numerous brand shops available in 1 area. Skin food, Etude, Nature Republic etc.., you'll not miss them, you'll see them anywhere. And there are hawkers selling cute socks, jackets etc..although I the socks were more expensive than the ones I got in the underground malls, they were still cheaper than back home. My daughters love them. Wish I had bought more."
Shopper's delight,"great buys, lots of items to choose from high end to bargain sales. Lotte Department store is just across the street were high end items are all available."
Good bargain on cosmetic and skin care products,"you will be swapped away by the whole street of shops of cosmetic, skin care products. Laneige, SkinFood, Tony Moly, etc. you name the brand and you will definitely get very good quality bargain products. And the best part, they are so generous with their free sample packs and gifts....."
Shopping Mania..,"Besides the department stores, there are so many Korean cosmetics stores such as Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Skin Food, Etude etc. there are also many street vendors selling snacks to all kinds of goods. Many people expecially young Korean couples around. Me and my girls just can't stop buying the cosmetics product since the price is so cheap compared to our place.Even if you are not into shopping, just be there to watch the happenings!"
One big yawn,"Myeongdong was highly recommended. When I stepped into Myeongdong, I was impressed with the number of shops initially. But on closer inspection, I found it baffling to find the same brand a few meters away. So I made a hasty retreat for some place else that has a better shopping experience."
Happening place!,"Ladies, buy your cosmetics and skin care here. Service is much better and u get loads of freebies. You can still pick up some at the airport duty free but choices are limited , service bad and no freebies. For eg, the Laneigh snow bb cream cushion is not available at airport!Shops start closing around 10.30pm.There are street food, cafe and restaurant all over. Bring lots of cash and credit card."
Never ending choices....,"The street starts from the exit of the subway station. there are many good stores on the left and right side of the street. The smell of barbequed octopus or local delicacy fill up the air. Shopping is good for all kind of budget,bw it a high end boutique or vendors at the stalls that lined up at the center of the roads. Love this place......"
Crowded but,"Although Myeongdong is very touristy and crowded, I really liked my time there. There are so many things to see and buy. The street food are also very nice. You should try the long unhealthy fried potato twist but I recommend sharing it with someone, one stick for me was a bit too much. Otherwise, there are lots of restaurants and coffee shops. Check out the stall vendors too that sell electronic accessories, souvenirs, cheap jewellry, etc.."
"A MIX OF GLORIETTA,GREENHILLS & DIVISORIA","This shopping complex has all the expensive european signature brands housed in Arcade fashion and locally made inexpensive goods such as bags, shoes, clothing, etc being sold in street stalls. Food stalls are also plentiful serving all kinds of street food. American& European Food Chains are also present here. Its all in an area the size of the Makati CBD."
Nice Shopping place,"I spend like half month's salary there because there was a sale going on at that time. one piece of advice, bring more cash or make sure your credit card works :)"
Great Shopping Area,Myeongdong is excellent area for shopping for everything from clothes to cosmetics. They are also key international shops like H&M and Forever 21.
The Times Square of Seoul,Myeongdong is a modern shopping area with hundreds of shops of both local South Korean brands as well as international brands. Many cafes and restaurants as well as the famous Nanta theater show is located here. We tried out the Korean pastries in one of the bakeries and sat down on a bench while watching the young locals pass us by. At night the food carts come in selling different local foods that people snack on while walking. If you have only one chance to go shopping in Seoul this is where you should go.
fun place to shop and people watch,"This is where all the young hipsters go to shop for cosmetics, cell phone accessories, eat good street food and just people watch. I love the energy of this place as you walk around. You can honestly walk around for hours and not buy anything and it's still fun!"
"Tourist trap, but just go to experience the vibrance","Get all your Korean beauty products here. All the shops have staff that can speak Mandarin. Also, U can get tax rebates here. If U wanna avoid the crowd, check out the beautiful Catholic Church at night. Approach any of the Guides in Red Jackets on the streets if U r lost. They are usually stationed right smack in the middle of Myeongdong where the Myeongdong Theater is."
"A good area to visit, shopping is pricy","The Myeong-Dong area is a modern shopping area with all the popular brands one can find in all western shopping malls. It's a nice area to walk around day and night, has some good restaurants and fast food, and a good atmosphere.Unfortunately, prices are very high to western travelers, I would estimate at least 10% higher than in (expensive) European cities and moch more than in the US."
Vibrant shopping area,"Myeongdong is a vibrant shopping area with Korean cosmetic shops and Korean fashion, bags and clothes all lined up. There are also international brands such as Forever 21, Zara, Uniqlo, Ralph Lauren, Aldo, etc. There also Korean food and international fast food joints around the vicinity. We went there at 9 PM and the streets were full given it is a working Monday. The shops are full of locals as well.I bought loads of BB cream! LOL. The streets are lined with cosmetic shops literally at every corner - Missha, Etude House, Skin Food, Nature Republic, etc. There are also shops selling Bags and accessories. A really nice place to shop. Shops are accepting credit card payments as well but prepare some cash for street vendors of accessories and street foods."
Must be here,"You will enjoy walking around this area especially when night falls lots of lighting, street foods, shopping. But things may not be cheap here can bargain but not much "
"Disappointed, typical shopping area","This place was a bit of a letdown during my three days in Seoul after what I read about the place.It had the usual high-end stores and the flashy neon lights. But there's nothing quirky about the place. No street performers, no people in weird costumes and nothing particularly unique, original or beautiful. It's just a straight up place to shop that you'd find elsewhere in Seoul and in most large Asian cities. It doesn't deserve its reputation for being the ""most see"" place in Seoul.Maybe it's good for the ladies who love shopping. But as a guy, I found it nothing more than a decent photo opportunity."
A shopping paradise!,"Just a tip, go here at night!! There are street stalls at night which are selling lot of stuff. You can find also street food stalls in the area. Indeed a cool place to shop especially bags and beauty products. We bought more than 10 bags for only 10000 won each! And also we bought facial masks and Missha bb creams for a cheap price. Missha bb creams are almost only half of the prices here in our country plus they give so many freebies!! Loving this place!My favorite place in Seoul!! If we get back in Seoul, Myeongdong is in our top list!! yay! PS: hungry? try Yoogane restaurant! They sell authentic Korean food. We really love their fried rice. How good? We ate 4 times there for our dinner. hehe.. =)"
This is the place to be,"Actually, after peeking around Seoul, you'll find that everything is concentrated in this area, from morning untill 10:30 night:Shopping, shopping, shopping... coffee, restaurants, Korean goods, massages, strollers and street foods, and 2 metro stations."
For teens and those wanting access to store brand items,"Why would I go to Seoul for Zara, Mango, and other store brands when I can get them in Tokyo, New York, Europe? 15 minutes in here and I was back to the Namdaemon Market for comparable items without the store brand label sewn on the product. However, if you don't have access to these Global store brands, go for it. Prices are reasonable. Expect crowds, particularly in the early evening."
Shopping paradice,"Abstract of shopping. You can buy everything you need from here. My recomendation is cosmetics, all brands are there. Ask them for freebies like samples. "
Shop and Eat,"Myeondong's reputation as a shopping haven is already given. But what I like about the place is the various food items laid out for one to taste. I missed the enormous Creme Puff which I didn't get to eat this time, but the stringy white pastry saved the day for me ! When in the area try the street food , cheap and tasty !"
Impressed by the area,The Uni qlo showroom is value for money in terms of quality and variety. Shinsegae is walking distance and so is the Namdaemun underground shopping distance
Cosmetics Heaven,"You will find a lot of the cosmetics shop along the street. Some even have 3-4 stores along the street and people will just call you and give you free gifts in order for you to enter their shops! Good place to collect free masks and cotton buds :D Anyway, have to be careful with your belongings! My friend lost her waller there ! The place was just too packed, on weekends!"
Shopping Adventure!,"I spent a day here and I even still couldn't get enough! So many stores here! I bought everything here. From CDs, cosmetics, clothes, and my favorite artist's stuff! So many restaurants too. But in the end I ate in KFC cause my tongue didn't really match with korean food :D Many coffee shops too, in case you're too tired after shopping.The most important part is the cosmetic store. Too many! You can just choose anything you like. The price is all pretty good too.It's very easy to get here. Once you're in Myeongdong Station, you can just walk out through any exit and it will bring you to Myeongdong.Just prepare lot of money when you decide to go here. And believe me, one day is not enough!"
shopping galore,"Everything you need to satisfy your shopping craze can be found here. From famous fashion brands, beauty products, discount shops and road side stalls you can get them here. And also tons of restaurants and coffee joints for you to hang around. "
Shoppertainment paradise,"If you can only spend half day in Seoul, this is the must place you have to visit.You can find all beauty brands on the streets or Lotte DFS. You can try the famous Korean food, e.g. grilled meat, ginseng chicken soup, or western fast food Starbucks, burger king hereLocal fashion shops SPAO or international chains, Zara, H&M, Forever 21 are all around.K pop shops are just situated inside Nature Republic!!!Nanta show is also available here.It's like Harbour City/Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong, Shinjuku in Tokyo, Orchard Road in Singapore."
Shopping!,"I love Myeongdong. Nature republic is my favourite shop there, I also visit the music shop in the same building. As well as the good shopping there are brilliant eating place. A full and fun day out."
prepare lotsa money!,"oh the things to buy! plenty of skin care + cosmetics shops here. they're really quite aggressive with many shops having one sales person outside trying to lure customers into the shops with free gifts. whether you buy anything or not, you are allowed to keep the free gift. i ended up having more free gifts than the things i actually bought. hahaha...some of the boutiques sells reallllly cheap clothes as low as 5000won. i'm not sure why but i managed to buy some =pi stay at this area and i was here everyday of my stay. if i ever come back to seoul this is one place i definitely will not miss."
Shops galore!,Lots of cosmetic stores and street vendors selling similar products. Be sure to eat the tall ice cream!
dizzying!,"dizziying myeongdong! shopping, sale, make ups, food, clothing's, everything u name it! good restaurant there as well. worth the money spend"
Fabulous shopping. Great style .,The styles in the shops were very nice. SomW reasonable prices and some are just ok. Definitely a place tongo for shopping. Must try the cosmetics. 
Too crowded,"I can imagine if you can shop all day, this area is perfectly for you.My wife did her shopping in about two to three hours, then we walked along different streets. There were so many people and you couldn't see both sides of the shops. Therefore there was no such thing as ""window shopping"".A lot of brands can be found in all other areas of Seuol rather than Myeongdon, why I have to be pushed around and watch my steps carefully.Relax!"
Interesting experience,"I'm not a shopper, so my trip to Myeongdong was more focused on getting a feel for the city. I wandered for a couple of hours through the streets, eyeing all of the various products - and people! It was a relatively crowded place with a lot of shopping for a wide variety of items and a mix of food here and there."
Love shopping here!,Everything is here from the $2 Daiso to expensive name-brand shops! I love the vibrancy of this area with the little market kiosks and shops with so many knick-knacks! Lots of different types of food to try too!
Way too many choices...,"Shopping in Korea can be fun, or not, but Myeongdon was quite interesting. It's mostly women's clothing shops and little stalls (I mean little, size of a bathroom stall). My wife had a good time browsing the latest Asian fashion and bought a few items. It was fun just to see the number of vendors in all the different buildings and so much clothing in one little area. It shouldn't be missed if you are into ladies fashion."
Shopping!!,"There's lots of shopping to do in Korea..from facial products to clothes, fashion accessories, bags etc. Prices might not be as cheap as Bangkok, but style and quality is on a different level. "
Don't miss this.,"What can I say? it's all here. everything you could have imagined putting in your suit case and bringing home is here. From major department store chains selling the finest quality luxury brands, to mom and pop shops selling high quality knock offs. Great resturaunts, food carts and everything in between, it's all here. This place is so popular that they never completely close, Don't waste your time trying to be clever by trying to find an off day with lower volume because this district is jam packed 7 days a week. The good news is that all the stores, stalls, carts, and shops that make their living here are completely used to the maddening crowds and have perfectly adapted to it.You will not have to wait any longer here for a meal to be served at a resturaunt or for someone to ring up your purchace as you would in any other shopping district in Seoul. It is really quite amazing to watch just how efficiant this place operates! it's multi tasking at a level you will never see back home..In fact, this is a must see just for the experience alone, becase you have never seen anything like it before and likely won't again... Even if you don't spend a dime here it will be somthing you will never forget."
Two hours is not enough!,"This location is teaming with shoppers and salespersons who enticed customers by hailing them from the street. Things are inexpensive and good. The ladies would want to visit the fully-packed Etube House for their cosmetics!. They said Obdo is good, but I say this is better in terms of lower prices and variety of mixtures and concoctions to beautify the female bodies and faces. And they give freebies too!Opposite Myeongdong is also another popular shopping street - Shinchon Ladies Street beside the higher end Shinsegae Shopping Centre. But here it looks like more Chinese-made goods are put on sale. Still it is much cheaper than those sold at Dongdaemun.So if you ask me for a good place to shop. These three places can keep you here for two days, hehehe!"
"Lots of shops, plus food stands at night","PSY's Gangnam style is blasting at night, and lots of neat food stands for cheap snacks or meals. Lots of shops and Lotte Department is a must-see to see how Koreans shop, especially at rush hour at the basement where you can grocery shop, or eat at stalls. South of this district you can walk up towards Namsan and N Seoul Tower."
Clean and safe night market -,"i am a white 50+ woman, been there several times on my solo trips through Seoul. Last time i spent about 5 hrs browsing the crooked streets - bargaining, sipping free ginseng tea, talking to vendors (some of them speak English). I watched some kind of official police rade last time. I shoped with US $$ and with a C/C (some vendors have computerized shops). "
"paradise for shopping, neon lights and city sneaking","if you want to buy korean fashion leave foot locker and so on behind, the local fashion brands are pretty great! sneak around the little alleys and stop by at the cathedral to calm down from all the shopping fuss. hilly seoul with lots of geen is walking distance! "
Cheap bargains for made in Korea goods,"Amazing area for shopping: clothes, cosmetic, facial products, casual bags, scarf. Make sure you bargain. Good selection of restaurants and street food to sample. Don't miss out the Underground shopping area on your way to/from the subway station too! "
Shop shop shop!,"Cosmetics shops, clothes, bags, cool stuffs are all here. The price is slightly higher than Dongdaemun. For restaurants, there are always long queue especially for those well-known. If you do not have time, try some snacks all along the streets. Lotte duty free is here too! You can spend a whole day just at Myeongdong. "
Nothing you've never seen at home,"Lot of neon, expensive outlets, and fastfood joints. Wasn't impressed. Do visit the nearby underground shopping center (and take someone with you that speaks Korean preferably if you want to get the prices down)"
The place to be!,"Full of shops, people, restaurants, people, noise, people, coffee places, people, madness and did I mention PEOPLE????"
Shop till our baggage were over weight!,Very good place for woman who love the cosmetics.Get the discount voucher from Korean Tourism sites.It's worth it. You need to spend at least half a day in this place.
Too busy to shop,I found this a fascinating place to people-watch rather than to shop. The area is too busy and there are too many shops and carts to go through. Rather stop at a coffee shop - we went to Dunkin Doughnuts and sat upstairs. This gave us a lovely view of the people and the fashions of Korea - so many stylish fashionable people. Forever 21 though was a popular choice with my daughters who told me the sale there was well worth the crowds!
Endless shopping,"So many shops for cosmetics, clothes, shoes, etc. Not to mention the night market. Basically every shop has staff who can speak Chinese, Japanese, and English."
Fantastic bargains!,Myeongdong is truly a shoppers paradise. Bargains and sales galore at every corner. This place comes alive at night. 
Pieceful Shopping,You can by everything in a place with variety foods and nice environment. Do a little bit bargaining to have competitive price when you purchase anything.
OMG!!!,If you love shopping and have a lot of money to waste go here. They have a variety of places to buy from. Some places are Korean brands but mostly American. 
Shop til you drop!,"I love love love Myeongdong as everything is there: H&M, Forever 21, Spao, Uniqlo, etc. to name a few. High end brands are just across the street when you go to Shinsegae or Lotte Department store. At night, it is always jampacked with people and there are food carts that sell street food. "
A great place for fashion,"Not everyone is a perfect size 6, so we found this area great as it catered for european sizes. So many shops to chose from this was a full on shopping day. We were thankful for the Starbucks coffee shop with air conditioning and free wifi at the end of a busy day. Easy to get to from the subway as well."
Budget shopping,Great shopping if youre on a budget. you can ask for discounts even at department stores. Make up and accessories overload.
Great Shopping,Love shopping at Myeongdong with all the cosmetic shop went crazy shopping there. Every brand of costmetic is there and shopping there is always a very enjoying trip.
Myeongdong is one of Seoul’s main shopping area featuring mid-to-high priced retail stores&ints brand outlet,"I had visited Korea last June 2012 with my best friend and cannot wait to visit this market since have very long lists for shopping. Over here you can find everything including clothes, shoes, handbags, accessories, and cosmetics. If you don't know where to spend money, recommended to visiting this area."
For shopper area with big crowd,Place to shop for all kinds of merchandise. This place is crowded and fashion shop along the street.All type of smelling when we pass by the street as there was restaurant. Trendy place but price is expensive. We recommend to do our shopping at Namdaemun and Dongdaemun where the price is reasonable. Dislike when we do shopping the sales girl can't speak in english and make difficult for us to bargin.
Seoul is not for shopping,"Extremely busy area with foul smelling food stalls. Seoul is no shopping place as most western brands are the same as back home, only far more expensive. If you want Korean brands go to the more quite areas as Insadong. If you do not like big crowds avoid Myeongdong area "
Great Shopping Area,"Perfect place to shop for Korean cosmetics... The place is trendy, filled with shops, boutiques, and street sellers... Exciting place... "
Shoppers Paradise,"Myeongdong is shopping heaven for Seoulites and visitors alike. Visiting after work on Monday, there were tons of people having dinner at the restaurants and the rest shopping up a storm. Imagine how much more crowded this shopping precint will be on weekends and holidays. What makes shopping in Myeongdong exciting is the coexistence of department stores like M Plaza and Milgiore, chain stores, boutiques and pushcart vendors. Fashion apparel and homegrown skincare/cosmetics are big business here, with salespeople shoving skincare samples - typically single use face mask sheets - into the palms passing females to entice them into their shops. Due to the intense competition among the stores they are happy to process VAT refund forms for purchases as low as ￦30,000. Credit cards are used widely but those who settle in cash are given a small freebie.Metro access to either Myeongdong Station or to Euljiro il-ga Station Exit 6."
Great shopping district,So good that we went twice in our 4 days stopover in Seoul. Loved the young atmosphere there and it's near N-Seoul Tower so a good location to eat before heading up.
Shopping haven,From cosmetic to fashion to snacks. The place I loved best in Seoul! Prices are really affordable and they usually come with loads of freebies. You can walk down the same street everyday with more and more things to buy as gifts or for own. Best deals for shopaholics!
Get all your face products here!,You can find all kinds of shopping here especially facial products. Go at night and you can enjoy the night market as well
Touristy craziness,One of the busiest places to shop. Lots of people and noise. Not very good quality in most places. Not worth the money. Be careful of your wallet. Pick pockets.
Shop! Shop! Shop!,"Of all the shopping districts, we found this to be the best. Dongdaemum sell textile, clothings, etc but this place has everything. There are beauty product shops, CD and DVD, Clothings, shoes and bags.The items are also more wearable as they will fit us. The korean size is very small. We find it very difficult to buy clothings in Korea. However, many of the bags are fake products so we did not buy any from the streets. We bought them at Lotte department store.Also better to buy make in korea stuff for a change than make in China stuff. Many of the shoes are made in China. So you need to check.We enjoy the shopping and eating along the streets here.There is even a theatre for stage shows within this area.Shop sales personnel speak English and many are from China and speak mandarin for the Chinese, Malaysian, Taiwanese tourists.We keep going to this shopping district.;)"
Happening,"Paradise for shopper but if local knows you're foreigner, they will up the price so you must bargin..there are alot of cometics shops in this area..etude, faceshop, missha..etc..."
shopping haven ...,My wife shopped here 2 days in a row because many of the quality Korean products were on sale. I had to come in the evening to see for myself & was impressed.
Too crowded,Good only for bargain hunters. Tend to be crowded and you need to know the area to find what you want to buy. Must bargain place but once you get your price you need to make the purchase or else you will get a very irritated vendor.
best shopping outdoor area in town,"i stayed near this area so almost every day and night i spent in this area for shop. this is the best area so far to shop and dine, because this area is huge to choose the place for dining is easy. there are a lot of italian, korean and japanese rests in this area. and also, there are a lot of cosmetics, clothing shops as well (local shops and international brands). it took me 2 days to finished walking in this area. so huge but worth it."
A must for adventurous shoppers,"This is one of my favorite areas of Seoul. For a quieter shopping experience, go during the day. There are some nice restaurants and lots of shops like Zara, H&M, and TONS of great beauty product stores. If you want more of an adventure, go in the evening, after 5 or 6 pm. The street vendors come out then and there are HORDES of Japanese tourists. It is very interesting. Very loud. But lots of good (and safe) street food. Don't expect any mega cheap bargains, but you can occasionally find a good deal on clothes or costume jewelry (usually in the shops, not from the street vendors). "
"Bustling, great food, cheap cosmetics!","I live in Japan and travel to Seoul almost every year to stock up on cosmetics, clothing and to get my fill of fantastic Korean cuisine. Myeongdong is always at the top of my list."
Crazy shopping,"You can find everything from branded stuff, local designer and cheap crazy korean style. If you're looking for kpop idol stuff, you might need to go on a hawk eye mode to spot it because the place is so tiny but lots of lots of Kpop merchandise in it."
An excellent Shopping Experience,"Staying in Myeongdong is definitely great. The shopping street is vast and it contains a diverse selection of stores for you to buy from. From the standard Faceshop to Etude House to many more... They will also give out free samples and try to entice you to go in and make purchases, Do remember to get Tax refund (>W30 000) receipt from them if not you will not get any. Food is easy to get also with the local eateries to MacDonalds there are plentiful there. Also to note that there are Travel Ambassador from Korean Tourism Board who are dressed in distinct Red uniform armed with maps etc to help those who are around. Happy shopping in Myeongdong."
Everything is there,All kinds of restaurants and shops are here. You don't need to go anywhere else for cosmetics because they are all here! 
Shopping haven for girls,"This is the place for girls....all the make up stores are here.For men, just look for a coffee shop and stay there for around 6 hours!!!"
Everything in one place,"You can basically get everything in one place ranging from street food, cosmetics, fashion, bags, shoes and entertainment"
Shopping galore,"If you are searching for skin care or makeup products, this is the place for you. Seems like every other shop is Korean skin care. Girls stand out and try to invite you in their stores as you pass by. There are also lots of clothing shops. We had Cold Soy Soup , not sure the Korean name for it, but it was good. Fun place to explore at least once."
Shopping shopping shopping,"Nice shopping! Alot of international brands also. Good place to buy all the cosmetics brand souvenirs. There's also street side stores later of the day.Our lunch at a certain basement traditional Korean food wasn't nice. But tea time at a random cafe at 2nd level was a nice experience. Didn't take a photo of the name of the cafe, only remember there's a tree at the center of the 2nd floor. We went in coz we saw the nice balcony from the streets! Not only is the place nicely decorated, the coffee n desserts were nice too. And they gave us a complimentary cake with biscuits! Totally make our day!A short walk to the base of the Seoul Tower from Myeongdong."
SHOPPING HAVEN!!!,"Shopping is an undertatement! MEGA Shopping is the right word for this great complex!!! You name it a store, they got it!!! Don't forget to bring your credit cards!!!"
Excellent Location... Great Shopping especially if you love Korean skincare products...You might go CRAZY!!,"1. Easily accessible by subway. Just get off at the MyeongDong station.2. If you don't speak English or Korean, shops, especially skin care and restaurants, have employees who speak Mandarin.3. I had a sausage in a stick all wrapped in french fries for only 2000 Won (street vendor). Very inexpensive and fulfilling. Couldn't finish it! Yum.4. The same brand has different stores in Myeongdong. I shopped at one store and they allowed me to leave my purchase with them while I shop at other stores. Be sure you get a business card from them (with the store number) to retrieve your purchase.5. They give you samples when you make a purchase. The bigger the purchase, the more samples you'll get.6. Before you go, you can check online to see if they're having any promotions for foreign tourists. You'll get, for example, 10% off your purchase if you're a foreign tourist. Make sure you go to the correct store. The coupon would state the name of the store and the store number.7. If you get too tired from shopping or purchase too much, you can find taxis next to the subway station exits."
"Fashion, Food and Beauty","Where else except here where you can get all you need in the streets make convenient with few branches of the same stores that you will not have to buy on first sight.For food choices, you can let your taste buds go wild from korean to all international within the square. My personal preferences were the traditional dumplings and BBQ...the aroma cannot be comparable in the hot summer nights. Moreover it is reasonable in pricing with many appetisers that before you even start, the filling of the many varieities left you to yean for more.With the K-pop music in the background, the local fashion is catching up to the themes of the world. Strictly no bargaining, the fun might be lessen...but then if you want to follow the trends, the selection have many choices.Along the streets, you will be able to get so many brands of Korean beauty items, comparable prices that one wonder why most koreans ladies look so meticulous with their facial make up.The personalised services in each beauty counter are one to comprehend as the ""little baskets"" are handed to you upon entering the shop.Despite having been to Seoul a few times, it will defintiely not going to be my last!"
Shopping Haven,"Clothes....clothes....clothes everywhere! A haven for fashionistas...branded...korean made...name it! I prefer the small shops than the popular ones which are also available in my country. One thing I've learned...buy the item you like on the stop as its such a hassle going back after ""thinking"" about it and ending up going back to get the item."
Myeong Dong- soak in Seoul's shopping scene,"I'd say walk here to 'see' what's 'IN' then buy at Doota & Migliore/ Erwha Women's University cos prices are slightly higher here.Note: Migliore here closed on Monday.Lots of great restaurants, just walk around and see where there 'ARE' patrons, you won't go wrong.Food: Great for Korean/ Korean barbecue/ Korean seafood, a few good ones here."
Buzzing amosphere unlike any other I have experienced,"I have been to Seoul twice and insist on staying in Myeongdong for its central location, ease of access and great atmosphere. This holds for shopping too and Myeongdong is a shopping heaven. Whilst it has huge high-end shopping malls like Lotte and Young Lotte, it is really characterised by the hundreds and hundreds of street shops that flank narrow streets spanning a huge area. These shops are western and many brands are recognisable in the US and Europe. Goods are quality products at Korean prices (i.e. Significantly cheaper than the west but nowhere near Thailand prices). Only issue is you struggle to find large sizes as most are skewed towards smaller Korean sizes, especially for women.In between the shopping you have restaurant upon restaurant, serving mostly Korean food but plenty of Italian food too. An infinate number of coffee shops and bakeries too. There are also Korean bangs (entertainment rooms) - tea bangs (my favourite), game bangs, dvd bangs to a few massage parlours (the massage parlours were way expensivo and not particular good). There are also two cinemas - one in Lotte and another in the street that have a late show starting at midnight. There is also the Myeongdong theatre definately worth checking out. I estimate that 90 percent of the people visiting Myeongdong are youngsters and this creates an exciting atmosphere. The place is absolutely jam packed every night of the week and weekend and every lunchtime during the working week.For its enormous range in shopping, brilliant entertainment options and a buzzing atmosphere unlike any other I have experienced, Myeongdong is a fantastic shopping option worth international recognition in my opinion. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!"
One stop skin care shopping and have a great meal while at it,"For tourists short on time but in need of korean cosmetics or skin care shopping, Myeongdong is the place to be. Upon exiting subway station, look for young people in bright orange vest. They offer help and map in several languages and will point out your current location. Almost all the stores are on the street level so the walk is very relaxing.Opening the map, you'll see that Myeongdong consists of several streets with duplicated stores. Pick a street with your favorite stores and shop there. When you're done, find one of the restaurants and have a great meal. Like most part of Seoul, if you go during peak hour, restaurants tend to be full. What's great is you can find out which restaurants are popular among local salary people (my Korean friends call office workers salary people). But going after peak offers a more relaxing meal.I visited Myeongdong at noon. During the middle of the day, there was no stalls on the street. So if you like street shopping, go at night.I don't think Myeongdong on its own is worth a trip. However, it's great to stop at Myeongdong, have a good meal and buy some cosmetics made famous by the popular korean drama and k-pop for oneselves or as gifts. The korean brand cosmetics are much better priced here in Korea than in the US. Some less than half what they cost in the US when they have their sales. Also buy Korean cosmetics in their own stores means no faked products from eBay. A great way to save, and play safe."
"Need to get your bearings, its an enjoyable maze!","Good area for shopping, Korean cosmetic shops have dozens of shops in the area. Shopping for clothes here will also provide a good choice of local and foreign brands. A lot of small restaurants are spread along the side streets."
NOT AS EXCITING,"Perhaps I read too much before going, but Myeongdong is not as hyper as it is made out to be. While it is vibrant and good way to absorb the atmosphere for a first time visitor, the place wears down quickly as stalls after stalls repeat their wares - including knockoffs of branded goods. Most unique nonetheless are the beauty shops under Korean brand names which are nice. The eateries are distinctly Korean and that's the nice part. Lots of snacks, restaurants and cafes. The underground shopping arcade looks sad and unexciting - compared to Japan. In a way, it reminded me of China and definitely several grades below the shopping experience of Hong Kong. Worth a visit or two, but seen that....done that."
Shop till you drop,"Good shopping, with a good mix of foreign and local brands of clothes. Lots of beauty shops too. There are also wide selection of food places. The prices are varied, I got a 3,900won local Tshirt to a more expensive foreign label SuperDry. Just one tip though : be very careful when buying the beauty products - look at the expiry dates, especially when the prices are much cheaper than other places. "
"Shopping, shopping, shopping","Lots of clothing, cosmetics, restaurants, electronics, sports stores. "
Orchard-like,"Uniqlo is quite big here, plus Migliore. So many people in the evening. Mostly young people. Easy to reach."
FindIng your way in Myeongdong,"if you are a fan of Korean cosmetics (The FaceShop,SkinFood, Innisfree, Tony Moly, Natural Republics etc), these beauty shops have several branches in Myeongdong. If you are likely to spend 30,000krw or more for Korean cosmetics and intend to claim tax refund, note that only certain branches provide tax refund service. Remember to check before you enter to make purchase. Also, check out Visitkoreayear website to for discount coupons (food and shopping) to help you save more.If you have problem finding your way in Myeongdong, try look for volunteer guides patrolling around Myeongdong Street. They go around in pairs, with beige hat and red polo shirt. They speak chinese, Japanese, a little English, and are ready to provide you a street map and show you the way."
Fashionable district,"Street that always crowds by people..nothing much i bought from here but i had fun with their 'pasar malam' atmosphere with new thingy that i had ever see. The most attraction i was looking for here is Spao. It is a boutique that must to visit by kpop fans though. You can enjoy everysing on the 5th floor, and dont forget to take sticker pictures with your bias. They offered awesome stuffs at affordable price. You also can visit everysing at apgujeong branch but you may feel regret if not buy anything at myeongdong branch which is the main everysing shop. M plaza also located in myeongdong, which Kimchi Academy is located, where you can book kimchi experience and hanbok wearing package. Hanji mirror making also including in the package with 30,000 won for 2 hours class. Classes offered in Korean, Japanese or English. They open for new package with ddeobokki making experience for 2012. Popular Hello Kitty cafe also located here, that one i had skip on my last journey. will visit next time. Myeongdong also one of the place to buy sourvenir but no much choices and quite expensive that you can find the same thing at cheaper price at other market."
Highlight of my Seoul Trip,"This is the place to be for shopaholics, foodholics, and anyone who appreciates the modern culture! Food is everywhere! From the best street food such as Ddeokbokki, Fish sticks, and sugary snacks. Restaurants and Cafes are also available. Clothing stores, small ones to big ones like Forever21 and H&M, all line up the streets. and of course, Cosmetics companies are always swarmed for their products endorsed by your favorite actors and singers. At night, the shopping district turns into a night market, so beware of the crowd and watch your things!Best time to come here is afternoon onwards till midnight"
a very congested shopping street,"if yyou go during the weekend or in the evening, the whole shopping street is full of shoppers, its have everthing from the low end to the high end things. You can find alot of cosmectics shops there. Dont forget to drop by the Hello kitty cafe...its cool"
my fave spot in Seoul!,"I've been 3 times to Seoul, and Myeongdong is a compulsory place for me to go. Not just for shopping, also for people watching and I even get to meet the Korean actress Song Hye Gyo (from Full House fame) once there :-)) I stayed at a hotel just across Myeongdong, so I'll visit the place everyday :-P Many many many cosmetics retailers here, and the night market is also great. Haha, I just adore the place :-PIt's a venue suitable for everyone, children, adults, mothers, aunties, just name it :-)"
Prepare to deal with xenophobia and racism,"There are plenty of foreigners here but if a Korean wants your dressing room or wants to order a meal first, prepare to give up your spot. Both of these things have happened to me a few times here. It is twice as the US and still slightly more than Europe unless you buy Korean off brands. The selection is excellent except for sizes; everything is very small and I often wear a small in US/Europe and shoes are often up to mens 8. Can often feel like an overcrowded night club but much more pushy."
Great place with good selections!,"Almost everything is here, from branded stuff to regular Korean fashion - good to spend at least half a day here!"
Shop-sanity,"Lace up your comfortable shoes and take a shot of patience. This place is shopping on steroids. You can't possibly prepare yourself for how crazy this place is! It's all here, you just need to weave your way through the sea of people to find whatever it is that you're looking for."
Sea of People,You will always find something interesting in some nook of myeongdong. And prices are competitive too
A good place for shop,"Myeongdong , really a good place to shop in Seoul. You'll find a lot of shops and restaurants around. The best time to shop is after 12pm. All shop are open for business. Most of the shop sales promoters able to speak English and Chinese , especially beauty products shop. There are a lot of hawkers if you go by evening. The famous Korea rice cake dip in hot and spicy sauce is good , it heated up your body during this winter. Cloths and shoes in this area is not cheap compare to HKG/SG/MY/TW but there is 1 thing which is worth for what we paid for , its Made in Korea. I bought 2 pairs of converse which is Made in Korea and 2 down jacket from Adidas which is also Made in Korea. Myeongdong is also 5mins away from Lotte Duty free. I did pay a visit to Lotte Duty free but came out with empty hand. Though is duty free but the price still consider expensive to me. You can actually pay in USD or KRW in Lotte Duty Free. By night , there are even more restaurant around in Myeongdong. I enjoy the Korean local food which also serve with famous kimchi."
Avoid weekend,The customer services in the cosmetic stores are not as good when there are too many people. Be aware that some sales are very pushy.
Must See! Fantastic Place day or night. Only place you need to go for Shopping.,"This is a very vibrant area. Within a 5 min walk you have everything you would need to entertain you during your stay: Department stores, Shopping malls, boutique shopping, restaurants, bars, market retail stalls, and market food stalls. Book your hotel in or near this area!"
exciting! rewarding!,Must go! Many Many shops selling cosmetics. Free samples! All kinds of masks! face! eye! foot! Sales ladies speak portugua very well. Shops selling small socks! Shops selling accessories! There are many food stores providing differenet cuisines.There is an underground shopping mall connecting to Namdemon. Not feeling cold even the temperature is - 5 degree! Heaters in all shops.
"Interesting, very busy shopping area!","This area is a must place to visit if you're in Seoul. There are so many shops selling different items like clothes, shoes, bags, and cosmetics. Women would love this area. But the place is very busy. The sidewalks are full of people.I like this area better than garuso-gil or dongdaemun. Maybe because there are several shops that caters to men. Some shops are also familiar brand like north face, uniqlo, giordano, puma, etc"
Shopping Haven + Food Haven!,Cosmetics are cheap. Try the street food like the locals do. :) an awesome place! 
Best time in Seoul I had with my Girl Friends!,"I went there with three girls and we had the best-est time!! The energy of the place was intoxicating and we just kept laughing the whole time. The streets got lots of people so you have to keep moving, but you can always squeeze in some pictures in. We ate all some street food there of intestines, seafood pancakes. It was a fun experiencing eating with locals and curious tourists alike. At the day we went, there were celebrities endorsing the SPAO clothing shop so there were lots of screaming and crying people in front of the shop. My friends took home some paparazzi pictures also. As for the shopping, the clothes there werent the best but it was ok as I went there for the facial and body care products.Your friends can have fun time choosing from the wide array of affordable face masks, creams and scrubs. With each buy, you get tons of freebies, and theyre very generous with it (cotton, facial wipes, bottles of toner and moisturizer etc,,it can be a good enough souvenir to some of your friends back home) One thing I notice was though was most of the salespeople there go after Chinese tourists and can either speak Korean or Chinese, so it feels alienating if you know neither. But luckily, two of my friends were Chinese so we got very helpful and enthusiastic service from the stores."
Best shopping street in Seoul!,"This was my most favourite shopping street of all that I went to! Generally new and clean, unlike Namdaemun market street. Tons of restaurants, shops are great, value-for-money! A nice historic cathedral right next to the streets and the Seoul tower is just across! Spent a whole day there, a must if you go to Seoul!"
myeongdong,"Recommend going on a weekday. Weekends are incredibly crowded it will be hard to make your way through the streets. Also go during late afternoon-night. This is when all the street vendors set up shop. Tons of designer knock offs and cute accessories for cheap and street food. This area doesn't close until around 11pm and even on weekdays, it will still be crowded but it'll be a little easier to breathe than on a weekend. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious!"
Shopping Paradise!!!,"This is awesome for shopping, especially for tourists. It's great cause most of the outdoor walking area has no vehicles, only pedestrians. We went on a weekday afternoon, so it wasn't too crowded, but I imagine when evening comes, there will be tons of people! Lots of different types of shops and priced from high end to nice cheap bargains! Great for souvenir shopping too! It's also a better place to find more Western sized clothing as there lots of brand name shops. Tons of beauty and skin product shops, which was my favorite part!! Korean shops are also very generous so you get tons of sample of other beauty products when you shop in their stores. Girls would stand outside the shops to try to get you to go in, and often they would give you free stuff even if you just go in and browse (I got some free face masks). Lots of places to stop for a drink or a snack if you get tired.Overall, a MUST GO if you are in Seoul."
Shopaholics' Haven,"We stayed just across the street from this great shopping paradise. Everything under the sun can be found here. All the Korean comestic brands can be found within 50 metres of each other. Apart from Migliore, clothes sold in the boutiques are expensive compared to Malaysian standard. However, you can find some good bargains for sale items. What I liked about the streets here is that they are vehicles-free and there are rows and rows of stalls which lined up in front of the shops selling food, knick-knacks, accessories, bags, etc, etc. There are many restaurants and food peddlars here. So you definitely will not go hungry. We even managed to get our hair cut here at less than USD 30. The salon is somewhere near Watsons and near is a nice shop selling spicy octopus and plain kimbap (sushi rolls) next to it. Our loot apart from a nice hair do - lots of cosmetics (what else ?) shoes, accessories, food (seaweed rolls, etc), CDs, bags and clothes. I find that the cosmetic shops here are more generous in terms of freebies and samples as compared to other areas. In fact, you don't even have to buy anything. Just head into one of the shops and the shop assistant will give you a sample or two. So, I bought most of my cosmetics here and the freebies are certainly handy for my short outstation trips. What can I say. I love Myeongdong!"
Shopping paradise!,"Myeong dong is seriously a shopping paradise. You can find shops that sell cheap and nice stuffs! And there is also a shop named 'SPAO' which is advertise by super junior and snsd. When you are tired,you can also rest in some cafes nearby seling donuts and drinks. If you are a shopping mania, myeong dong will be the must visit place for you in seoul!"
captures the mood of modern Korea,"I loved Myeong-dong. If you are looking for shopping, this is one of the best places in Korea to go. Myeongdong has everything. The stores range from ridiculously high-end places with $700 heels and world-class designer wear, to the street stall markets and shops that you would see in places like Namdaemun and Itaewon. You'll also find everything in-between. I personally love how there are so many boutiques that sell trendy clothing from local designers-you can find things that are one-of-a-kind, and great quality, too. These small stores are sandwiched between massive versions of stores that supply quality and affordable basics like Forever 21, Zara, and H&M. Also, this is one of the few places in Korea where western sizes aren't problematic. I found jeans that are cut for curvier bodies, a rarity here.The best part of Myeong-dong is that the streets are vibrant and crowded, K-pop is blaring along side the ""old pop"" that drawls from cheap radios in the stands and stalls, eye-popping fashion trends whizz by on 5 inch heels, and bizarre fusion foods are piled high on skewers and grills -you really get a feel for the crazy, ""bali-bali"" atmosphere of ""old meets new"" Korea as you shop!"
Shopping Paradise!,"Myeongdong is a 'must visit' place with endless shopping and dining experience.There are plenty of fashionable stuff for you to buy,nice restaurant for you to try on and catch the people's 'live and latest' fashion trend.There are mascots walking around giving out brochures and you can take pictures with them. I will definitely want to be there again because this place is a 'paradise'!"
Great place to shop,"Myeongdong is quite possibly my favourite placed to shop in Seoul. So many beauty shops like Laneige, Skinfood, The Face Shop, Innisfree etc...great for us ladies of love cosmetics! Service in most of the shops seems to be very friendly and efficient, although much of the staff speak limited English. There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
Stay away from mascots outside stores!,Much have been said about Myeongdong shopping so I won't talk about the same stuffs again. Just a tip to anyone going there soon. You are likely going to encounter numerous mascots in Myeongdong. Some of them stand in the middle of the road advertising for some restaurants. Notable ones would be a Garfield and a Snoopy. These are safe to stand beside and take a photo with them. There are some mascots that stand outside the store that employed them. Stay away from them. They will grab you by the arm and drag you into their store.
Shop till you drop...,"Myeong-dong is a shoppers’ paradise although, as a previous reviewer has pointed out, it mainly seems to cater to young women. There are literally dozens of shops like “The Body Shop” and the local Korean equivalent “Nature Republic”, selling all manner of skin care, hair care and body care prods. There are also masses of street stalls hawking the usual array of cheap jewellery, clothing, souvenirs, trinkets and nik naks. And for those (like me) not too fussed with shampoo and make-up, there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars to enjoy. American-style coffee bars like Krispy Kreme, Starbucks and Gloria Jeans abound and they seem to be thriving in Seoul, unlike in my home country, Australia, where many are struggling to survive.With a few thousand won in your pocket (pretty cheap by Australian standards: one Aussie dollar buys about 1,100 won) you’ll never go hungry. A bowl of noodles with vegetables for example will set you back around 7,000 won or 6.50 Aussie. Many Korean eateries have English translations on their menus but in any event there are enough western-style restaurants if Asian is not to your taste.Then there are the upmarket department stores. We visited the two largest and most famous ones, Lotte (pronounced Lo-tay) and Shinsegai. Both are within easy walking distance of Myeong-dong. But unless you are seriously wealthy, these are for sightseeing and gawking only and forget about buying anything here. However, you can eat at either as they both have food halls with plenty of choice and variety. We dined one eve at the Lotte Food Hall, which is just behind the food market in the basement. We also visited the food court at Shinsegai – they call it the “Food Garden”. Unlike Lotte’s, Shinsegai’s food court is on the top floor. We lunched at the sushi counter which wasn’t overly expensive: about 7,000 won for three shared plates. Afterwards, we stepped outside to the children’s play area to enjoy the view. Of course, being the play area, the safety-conscious Koreans have built a high wall around it but you can still peer over the top for a view of the city. But we found the best shopping is to be had in the underground concourses which lead you to the various train stations. They seem to have the best variety and prices. Better quality than what one would find aboveground and not nearly as expensive as the upscale department stores. Ideal to shop here for those little gifts for family and friends like fridge magnets, t shirts, pens and key rings!"
"Woman's heaven, Men's hell !!","This place is surely a woman's heaven. There are so many brands of cosmetic products which sells at fraction of the price. My spouse went crazy shopping and was smilling from ear to ear.... Happy Shopping, ladies !!"
"If you don't like marketplaces, don't bother spending time there",This place is one humongous market and since I dislike markets in general I could endure 10-15 minute visit just for curiosity.
"Shopping Heaven for Women! Shopping Tips, and more!","As a man I have to say there is not all that much there for us. There are stores and shops like Uniquo and Zara and many others that do sell men's clothing and stuff, but overall most of the people you see there will be women, about 70%. Men should not be turned off to go here, but keep in mind that mainly it cater's to women like most shopping places in the world. There are shops for cosmetic products, shoes, accessories, clothes, hats, etc. Anything you need as far as fashion you can probably find it here. There are lots of people especially when it starts getting dark, but even during the day it is fairly crowded. There are some stands that sell knock-off products also like belts and bags. Also note, some of the outside vendors you can bargin with, but some you cannot. The belts are a great example of this, even when they are packing up to go home they will tell you one belt is 15,000 and last price, but guess what, no matter what time you go there, it's the same price. For some other stores it may be different, some of them will bargin at the last minute, but do not expect a huge discount, perhaps 500-1000won depending on how expensive the item is. If the item is really expensive, like 60,000won you may be able to get 5000. Do not push too much as some of them seemed to get a little annoyed at tourists doing this. But there is some bargining room at some of the stores.Keep in mind that a lot of shops start packing up between 10 and 11pm. Honestly I cannot remember if it was 10 or 11. But the whole area pretty much shuts down around that time.There are also places in the area to buy ginseng products, but no one there speaks English or very very limited English. So if you need advice or help you may be out of luck. But you can look through the products, they do have a huge selection and I think most people can figure out what it is if you are only looking for candy or something like that, it is easy to find.I would have to say that Seoul itself is a paradise for women shoppers, where some department stores are open 24 hours a day and others do not open until like 8pm, there are a few of these in the Dongdaemun area for example.There are also many resturants in the area, many of which the staff speaks no English, however some of them do have English menus. Anyway I think it is worth a look for at least a few hours. And if you happen to want to see the Nanta show, one of the theaters is located in this area, in Seoul there are three, so make sure if you already have tickets that you know which theater you are supposed to go to. Grab a map at the hotel also and look for the people wearing red shirts in the area because they can help you or maybe even give you a map of the area. I forgot where we got our map for this area only, but it was useful nevertheless."
Hyper Shopping,Since there is not a review in English i will tell you this place is nuts. Super fun shopping district with street vendors and food. If your are traveling with a female young or old this is the place of there dreams. If your single this is the place of your dreams. I liked it much more then Harajuku and thought the prices were much cheaper. Oh yea this is cosmetics central too. I thought this was the most fun area in Seoul and not to be missed. Late evening is the best time to go.
Insane shopping,"The shopping is insane. But sometimes it really depends on your luck whether u find anything u like especially when u are fussy. My fren working in Seoul recommended me some great finds. For cheap China made clothing, go to Migliore at Myeong Dong Exit 7. For cheap and nice working clothes (korean made) try this place called ""Roem"", its a straight walk down from exit 7 (after the first intersection, easy to find). For high pigmented eyeshadows, try this brand called ""Tears"". You can google ""natural tears"" for more info. Walk from exit 7 and turn left to at the first intersection. Its beside ""skin food"" or near dunkin donuts. Their lip glosses are fantastic as well. For lingerie try ""amir feel"" Happy shopping :)"
It's a mad place to be!,"We were here on X-mas eve and it was jammed-pack that we could hardly move! At some point, I even thought that it was worst than Beijing subway during peak hour!! It's definitely a good place to shop and to eat. Found a nice sushi joint in the alley next to the Apple store. It was yummy and the price is reasonably cheap. It has post-it notes all over the wall and ceiling. Do try the street food vendors. Although one of our friends got stomach bug on the 2nd nite we were back there after eating the cinnamon cake from street food vendor. The others were all ok though..:-) You can find the same items that were sold by the street stalls in Dongdaemun with cheaper price."
Wow so many shops!!!,"Lots of shops and very busy, for the traveller from North America there is not a lot that can't be found at home at less cost. You should visit more for the spectacle and the food."
Lots of bargains of cosmetics,"The 9/F of Lotte Department Store is a duty free shop with many Korean brands of cosmetics at a 5-15% discounts. The ginseng face cream from a famous Korean brand costs about 40% less than in Hong Kong. The varieties available are, however, not as many as their specialty shops in the streets of Myeongdong. I also highly recommend a nail polisher at famous chain store starting with ""I"" which gives one a shinny nail after a few rub - really amazing and extremely cheap! We did not know what it was before the shop lady gave each of us a rub on our fingers on the spot! Great fun!"
Paradise place to Shop in Korea,"Myeongdong is a nice place for shopping, lot's of shops, usually with clothes and place to eat! International brands are also present, but because of this the atmosphere is way tooooo far from ""Korean"". And many things you can find in the same shops but in other countries...http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SH/SH_EN_7_2_3_1.jsp<-- Nonprofit site by Official site of Korean tourism - Myeong-dong"
Must stop by if you are into shopping,"I only had a few hours shopping at Myeongdong in July while on a business trip. The stores don’t open that early. I got there shortly before 10 in the morning and some of the shops are just setting up. There are a couple of cosmetics stores that are “must stop by” places if you are interested in Korean cosmetics. The Missha store in particular was worth stopping by. The same product is $30 online and I got it for around $12. If you are interested in fashion, then Myeongdong is definitely better than Namdaemun Market. The stores at Myeongdong have trendier stuff than Namdaemun Market, which is only a short walking distance away. Namdaemun Market is better for the older generation to buy clothes, also household items. If you can, plan your day so that you can have lunch at Myeongdong. I had Bibimbap (mixed rice with vegetables), yum….."
Best place to shop in Seoul,"Of all the areas I went to in Seoul, Myeongdong was my absolute favorite. The streets were just lined with so many shops and good restaurants. It was a great place to get some good deals on clothes and accessories. I especially enjoyed the department stores and live performances. There was just so much to do."
